     REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE. 
    
      
       The first matter on the Order Paper to-day is the Report of Committee on Procedure. 
    
    
      
       I suppose the best way this Report could be dealt with would be that some member of the Committee would move that it be received, and then that the Dail should consider it in Committee with a view to adopting it with or without amendments.  That was the procedure we adopted in the case of former Standing Orders, and as you, A Chinn Chomhairle, were Chairman of the Committee and are precluded by your present office from making a motion of that kind, I beg to move now &ldquo;That the Report be received, and that the Dail will proceed to consider same in Committee.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I beg to second the motion. 
    
    
      
       I do not know whether you consider, if the motion is carried, that it would be necessary to move each Standing Order separately. I suggest that that would be scarcely necessary. 
    
    
      
       I think   it would not be necessary to move each separately.  The motion now is that the Report be received, and that we go into Committee on the Standing Orders and consider them with a view to amendment, if necessary. 
       Question put and agreed to. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - STANDING ORDERS&mdash;SCHEDULES.  A.&mdash;FINANCIAL PROCEDURE. 
    
      
       The Orders are in three schedules&mdash;one dealing with Financial Procedure; one dealing with the communication between Dail Eireann and Seanad Eireann; and the other, proposed amendments to our existing Standing Orders.  The Financial Procedure is put first, as it is understood it is urgent that we should have Standing Orders to deal with Financial Procedure. 
    
    
      
       Is it proposed to move these by schedules, and then that any matter that might arise on any particular schedule should be discussed under that schedule rather than on each separate Standing Order? 
    
    
      
       No, I think it would be better to take each individual Standing Order as moved. 
    
    
      
       My suggestion was that it should not be necessary formally for some Deputy to move each Standing Order and someone else to second, but that on each being put from the Chair such suggestions or alterations that might be made could be dealt with. 
    
    
      
       Yes. 
       Order No. 1 on Financial Procedure. 
       Agreed to. 
       ORDER No. 2. 
    
    
      
       I just wish to take advantage of the fact that an Order is proposed to suggest that we ought to have a statement from you, A Chinn Chomhairle, or from the Minister for Finance on what is, after all, a mere question of wording, but yet not unimportant.  That is the question of nomenclature.  I see the words estimates and also financial resolutions.  I   believe the word Budget was used here in the Dail last night.  I would like to have the statement, because I am not quite clear on the matter.  One knows exactly the kind of nomenclature that is used in other Assemblies in regard to these matters.  It is clear that our titles are not exactly coincident with theirs, or rather it seems so to me.  I think it would serve a useful purpose if we were to have that point dealt with. 
    
    
      
       Taking Orders 1 and 2, what is the precise explanation asked for? 
    
    
      
       The question arises on Order No. 2, which deals with resolutions voting money for public services. Am I to regard that as being such a resolution as was introduced prior to the Criminal Injuries (Amendment) Bill; or is it definitely that a series of resolutions which, budgetted together, are generally to be referred to as the Budget? 
    
    
      
       That is what is meant by any resolution or series of resolutions here in this case. 
       Order No. 2 agreed to. 
       ORDER No. 3. 
    
    
      
       With reference to Order No. 3, I think some difficulty might arise in this particular year, when we will be presenting our first set of ordinary yearly Estimates.  I understand it will not be possible to have them in the hands of Deputies 14 days before the 1st April, so that, if this particular Standing Order were adopted in the form in which it is here it would be necessary to have some agreement that the amount of time might be less in this particular year. 
    
    
      
       That point was considered very carefully by the Committee. 
    
    
      
       I was going to explain that, A Chinn Comhairle.  It is not 14 days before the 1st April; it is 14 days before they are considered, and not later than the 1st April.  They have not to be taken into consideration on the 1st April, but that is the latest date on which the Order provides they should be in the hands of Teachtai. 
    
     
    
      
       The point is not that they must be introduced 14 days before the 1st April, but that they must be introduced 14 days before they are considered, which need not be the 1st April. 
    
    
      
       I thought it would be necessary, for the purpose of providing finances for carrying on the public services, that the Estimates should be considered, and should be introduced, in fact, on the 1st April at least, and that certain resolutions should be passed.  I do not know whether or not it will be necessary to have a Bill. 
    
    
      
       It would. 
    
    
      
       In actual practice, if this Order were to be adopted the Estimates would have to be in the hands of Deputies on the 17th, or so, of this month. 
    
    
      
       No.  I think the Minister could get a Vote on Account without bringing in all the Estimates before the 1st April. 
    
    
      
       I am inclined to agree that the Minister's interpretation is the correct one.  I have not a copy of the Constitution with me, but, as well as I recollect, his interpretation coincides with my memory on it, that the accounts must be presented to the Dail, and not merely be in the hands of Deputies, before the 1st April. 
    
    
      
       Article 36 of the Constitution reads: &ldquo;Dail Eireann shall, as soon as possible after the commencement of each financial year, consider the Estimates of receipts and expenditure of the Irish Free State (Saorstat Eireann) for that year, and, save in so far as may be provided by specific enactment in each case, the legislation required to give effect to the Financial Resolutions of each year shall be enacted within that year.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       That is the following year. 
    
    
      
       The year beginning on 1st April next. 
    
    
      
       Could a Vote on Account be given before the Estimates had been before the Dail? 
    
     
    
      
       I think so.  That happens constantly, because Estimates are being considered up to August, and a Vote on Account needs to be taken in March. 
    
    
      
       The question is, after they have been presented? 
    
    
      
       Yes. 
    
    
      
       As well as I recollect, there is some Article in the Constitution which states that they must be presented before the end of the financial year. 
    
    
      
       Articles 36 and 54. 
    
    
      
       Article 54 says: &ldquo;The Executive Council shall prepare Estimates of the receipts and expenditure of the Irish Free State (Saorstat Eireann) for each financial year, and shall present them to Dail Eireann before the close of the previous financial year.&rdquo;  It is because of that Article that the Standing Order states that they must be presented not later than the 1st April.  The purpose of the Standing Order is to fulfil that particular provision in the Constitution. 
    
    
      
       Then they must be presented to Dail Eireann before the 1st April, and the Standing Order continues to say &ldquo;be in the hands of members 14 days prior to their consideration.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       No, not at all.  The Committee considered these Standing Orders very carefully in connection with the Constitution, and if they were read as carefully as the Committee considered them I think they would be quite clear to everyone. 
    
    
      
       I have just read them again, and I think the difficulty I anticipated does not arise. 
       Order No. 3 agreed. 
       ORDER No. 4. 
    
    
      
       I should, perhaps, say that Standing Orders 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are concerned with procedure in Committee on the Estimates&mdash;called Committee of Supply sometimes.  We already had an experience of them in the Dail, and these Standing Orders are   the Orders which the Committee considered would suit our circumstances. 
       Order No. 4 agreed to. 
       ORDER No. 5. 
    
    
      
       This is really a question of a General Order, but it is put here specifically as well. 
       Order agreed to. 
       ORDER No. 6. 
       (1)  When it is intended to move more than one reduction in any Vote or Item of a Vote, the question shall first be proposed from the Chair on the largest reduction. 
       (2)  When several motions are offered they shall be taken in the order in which the Items to which they relate appear in the printed Estimates. 
    
    
      
       Do you agree to No. 6? 
    
    
      
       I do not know whether the word &ldquo;offered&rdquo; in 6 (2), first line, is the best word that could be used.  I do not think one uses the expression &ldquo;to offer a motion.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       It is an Americanism which has got in. 
    
    
      
       I suggest it should be framed to read &ldquo;when more than one motion has been put down.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       &ldquo;When several motions are proposed&rdquo; might suit. 
    
    
      
       That is another difficulty&mdash;you can only propose one motion at a time.  Several motions have not been proposed.  &ldquo;When it is intended to propose more than one motion&rdquo; would be more in accordance with accuracy. 
    
    
      
       If we worded 6 (2) in the same way as 6 (1) and say &ldquo;when it is intended to move several motions,&rdquo; would that meet the case? 
    
    
      
       That was in my mind.  &ldquo;When it is intended to move more than one motion they shall be taken in the order in which the items,&rdquo; and so on. 
    
     
    
      
       Would this do?  &ldquo;When it is intended to move more than one reduction they shall be taken in the order in which the items to which they relate appear on the printed Estimates.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Yes; I think that would meet the point. 
    
    
      
       What does &ldquo;they&rdquo; refer to? 
    
    
      
       To more than one motion. 
    
    
      
       Better substitute &ldquo;such motions.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       It reads now: &ldquo;When it is proposed to move several reductions they shall be taken in the order in which the items to which they relate appear in the printed Estimates.&rdquo; Would that suffice? 
       Agreed. 
       ORDER No. 7. 
       After a question for omitting or reducing any Item of a Vote has been put from the Chair and voted upon, no motion or debate shall be allowed upon any preceding Item. 
    
    
      
       That appears redundant. If a motion were put from the Chair the words &ldquo;and voted upon&rdquo; do not seem to be necessary.  If a motion were put from the Chair surely you would not allow a debate on the preceding item? 
    
    
      
       The Committee considered the form of the Estimates, and they rather thought that the words &ldquo;and voted upon&rdquo; should be left in.  If you had items for, say, the National Museum, the National Library and the School of Art, all appearing under one Vote, and somebody moved to reduce the third item, the School of Art, it would be impossible to go back once that had been voted upon. The Chair might allow someone to go back before the vote had been taken if it seemed reasonable. 
    
    
      
       You will find that provided for elsewhere here. 
    
    
      
       It might be necessary to move to reduce Item   No. 1 after having moved about No. 3. The insertion of the words &ldquo;voted upon&rdquo; leaves considerable liberty to Deputies.  It leaves to the discretion of the Chair to allow a motion on the previous item.  That is what it amounts to exactly. 
    
    
      
       Yes, I agree with the idea. 
       Agreed. 
       ORDER No. 8. 
    
    
      
       That follows as a matter of course. 
       Agreed. 
       ORDER No. 9. 
       There shall be appointed at the beginning of each financial year a special Committee to be designated &ldquo;The Committee of Public Accounts&rdquo; to examine and report to Dail Eireann upon the accounts showing the appropriation of the sums granted by Dail Eireann to meet the public expenditure, and to suggest alterations and improvements in the form of the Estimates submitted to Dail Eireann.  The Committee shall consist of nine Teachtai, none of whom shall be a Minister, and five of whom shall constitute a quorum.  The Committee shall be otherwise constituted according to the provisions of Standing Order No. 46. 
    
    
      
       That is largely a question for the Dail then sitting.  I think it is all right. 
    
    
      
       Standing Order 46 is the Standing Order which prescribes how Committees shall be appointed and so on. 
    
    
      
       Standing Order 46, as it is, would leave anything in the nature of putting the Committee on a proportional basis to some sort of private arrangement. Because if you take 46 literally it would mean that the Committee would be appointed in the ordinary way by a majority vote.  Perhaps the Committee on Standing Orders considered this.  It simply says: &ldquo;The Dail may appoint special Committees upon Motions appearing on the Agenda. Such motions shall, save as otherwise provided in these Standing Orders, specifically state the terms of reference to   the Committee, define the powers devolved upon them, nominate the members to act upon them, state the quorum in each case, and, if necessary, fix a date upon which they shall report back to the Dail.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Read the next one. 
    
    
      
       &ldquo;The Committee shall, as far as possible, be representative of all parties of opinion in the Dail.&rdquo;  That is a very loose thing. 
    
    
      
       The only amendment you need under Order 9 is that the Committee shall be constituted according to Standing Orders 46 and 47. 
    
    
      
       The Minister considers the word &ldquo;representative&rdquo; not sufficiently explicit. 
    
    
      
       It may not have been quite sufficiently considered by the Committee. It might be, in a case of an important Committee like this, desirable to make specific provision for appointing it on a proportional basis. 
    
    
      
       The Committee were really considering it in the light of our own experience.  I think every Committee appointed heretofore has been appointed by proportional representation or on a basis that gave an agreed amount of representation to every party in the Dail.  The Committee had that in their mind more than anything else when drawing up that Standing Order.  But that experience might be put into words and made binding. 
    
    
      
       Except we were to put in a clause saying the Committee was to be elected on a single transferable vote, which is perhaps too precise at the moment, I do not think it is necessary. 
    
    
      
       It is not necessary perhaps for our own particular experience in this Dail, but it might be necessary for the future. 
    
    
      
       That is what I was going to point out&mdash;that we are laying down rules now for the future, and, while we might not specify the exact form or precise method in which the election of such a Committee should take place, it would be advisable to indicate now that such a Committee ought to be representative of the different sections   of the Dail.  We think that would be met by referring to Standing Order 46&mdash;&mdash; 
    
    
      
       Standing Order 47 
    
    
      
       47 covers 46.  We accept the principle that the Committee ought to represent the whole Dail.  I do not think there is any danger that any other opinion would prevail in any other Dail, but it is just possible that a majority of the Dail supporting a Government might possibly, for its own protection, appoint a Committee almost entirely representative of its own party. That is not the intention here.  With regard to the Committee that is to examine the accounts, that Committee ought certainly to be drawn from all sections. 
    
    
      
       I would suggest that you might with advantage add &ldquo;according to the provisions of Standing Orders 46 and 47.&rdquo;  A small point arises on this, but on examination it may not prove to be so trifling.  I would suggest that instead of saying &ldquo;The Committees shall, as far as possible, be representative,&rdquo; which is hardly what is intended, that you might with advantage say &ldquo;Committees shall be, as far as possible, representative.&rdquo; There is a real difference between the two, and I think there should be a little amendment of the punctuation.  As it appears there it might be read that it was not desirable that a Committee should be representative because it was not possible, whereas by the slight change I suggest it would make it clear that it should be representative as far as possible. 
    
    
      
       With a multiplicity of independent Members I foresee that there might be a complaint that a Committee was not representative of all parties in the Dail.  I think that is fairly obvious.  Standing Order 47 would, I think, be better than 46. 
    
    
      
       Would you take Article 55 of the Constitution and add from it the words &ldquo;so as to be impartially representative of Dail Eireann&rdquo;? 
    
    
      
       Your suggestion is to insert in this new Order No. 9 words taken from Article 55 of the Constitution? 
    
    
      
       Simply my suggestion   is to adopt the words from Article 55 of the Constitution: &ldquo;so as to be impartially representative of Dail Eireann.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Would it meet the view of the Dail to amend Article 9 in the following manner: &ldquo;There shall be appointed at the beginning of each financial year a special Committee impartially representative of Dail Eireann,&rdquo; and so on? 
    
    
      
       It would do to insert the additional words at the end. 
    
    
      
       In that event it would be amended in this manner &ldquo;... The Committee shall be otherwise constituted according to the provisions of Standing Order 46, and so as to be impartially representative of Dail Eireann.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       We would want to have defined the meaning of the word &ldquo;representative.&rdquo; It may be supposed to mean one from this side and one from that side and one from the other side. In my opinion, that would not be right at all.  It would not be representative of the Dail.  One man from each party would be able to explain the views of that party, but he would not be representing them.  My idea of representation is that the parties ought to be represented on the Committees according to their power here, and according to the strength of the numbers that sent them here.  You can read two meanings into the word &ldquo;representative.&rdquo;  The real interpretation is, that the members of the Committee should be representative of the different parties, according to their strength.  Otherwise the Committee would not be representative of the Dail. 
    
    
      
       A difficulty arises if one wants to appoint a Committee ahead. The work of this Committee, although it may be appointed at the beginning of the Parliamentary year, will really not commence for a long time afterwards. You might appoint a Committee, and the personnel might not be available in six months' time when the work begins. Therefore it is necessary that the matter should be left a little loose, and that Committees should not be appointed on what I might call a P.R. Election.  If they were to be appointed on the P.R. system at the beginning of the year, and   there were a chance vacancy later, we would have a difficulty. 
    
    
      
       I have suggested the words &ldquo;impartially representative of Dail Eireann.&rdquo;  I think that should cover it, and that the word &ldquo;impartial&rdquo; would meet the point Deputy Gorey raises. 
    
    
      
       As Mr. Johnson says, a new election may change the strength of the parties.  If it does, the Committee ought to be changed. 
    
    
      
       This is a Committee that will be dealing with special matters, and it may happen that a particular party may be entitled to one representative, and may actually have within its ranks two persons eminently suitable to act.  If we tie ourselves up too much we might not be able to appoint them. 
    
    
      
       That might be a representative Committee, but not a suitable one. 
    
    
      
       Are we to add these words, &ldquo;So as to be impartially representative of Dail Eireann&rdquo;? Is that agreed? 
       Agreed. 
       Question put: &ldquo;That Order 9, as amended, stand part of the Schedule.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
       ORDERS 10, 11, AND 12. 
    
    
      
       Orders 10, 11, and 12 refer to Article 35 of the Constitution, and to the duties imposed on the Ceann Comhairle by that Article. The Constitution does not define who shall convene the Committee of Privileges and who shall ask the senior Judge of the Supreme Court to act.  The Committee places that duty upon the President. 
    
    
      
       Is that my duty sir? 
    
    
      
       There is nobody else.  It is a duty which the Ceann Comhairle could not perform, because it is his decision which would be impugned, and somebody else must perform that duty.  The Committee think that the President is the only person to do it. 
    
    
      
       Very good. 
       Orders 10, 11, and 12 agreed. 
    
     
    
      
       That disposes of these financial orders. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - B.&mdash;STANDING ORDERS REGULATING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DAIL EIREANN AND SEANAD EIREANN. 
     1.&mdash;MESSAGES. 
    
      
       The next business is the question of communication between Dail Eireann and Seanad Eireann. 
       ORDER No. 1. 
    
    
      
       Who is the Officer of Communications?  Is he one person, or may any person be appointed for that purpose according to the decision of the Ceann Comhairle in one case and the Cathaoirleach in the other? 
    
    
      
       Colonel-Commandant Brennan is the Officer of Communications. This is the second time, I think, that I told you that, if I recollect correctly. 
    
    
      
       I am asking you, a Chinn Chomhairle, if that is the intention of this Order? 
    
    
      
       If what is the intention? 
    
    
      
       If this was the intention&mdash;to confirm the proposal put forward, the appointment that had been made by the President, so that we may know exactly if it is one person, or whether the Officer of Communications means that the Ceann Comhairle may appoint any officer for that purpose, or the Cathaoirleach in his case. 
    
    
      
       He shall be nominated by the President.  It is quite plain. 
       Order No. 1 agreed. 
       Order No. 2 agreed. 
       ORDER No. 3. 
    
    
      
       I should explain that &ldquo;at the first convenient opportunity&rdquo; was put in there after some discussion, and it is taken to mean &ldquo;after some particular item on the Order Paper.&rdquo;  The second provision provides, &ldquo;In case of special urgency any business in progress, on the receipt of such message, may be interrupted to hear the same.&rdquo; 
    
     
    
      
       I think the idea of the committee in framing this, in a double form, was, supposing we were debating a motion and the message that arrived did not appear to the Ceann Comhairle to be a very urgent one, that he, in the exercise of his discretion, would allow the debate on a motion to proceed, and when it had concluded he would communicate the message that had been delivered to him from the Seanad.  If the message were one of considerable urgency he might then interrupt the speaker who was on his feet and wait until he took his seat, and then communicate the message he received.  We would then decide whether we would interrupt the business of the Dail and deal with it at once.  The message would be first delivered to the Ceann Comhairle, he would read it, and form his own opinion whether it appeared sufficiently urgent to stop the business at the moment to communicaite his message, or whether he would wait until the motion before the Dail was debated. 
       Order No. 3 agreed. 
    
    
      
       Order No. 4 is exactly of the same nature. 
       Order No. 4 agreed. 
    
    
      
       Order No. 5 concerns Article 38 of the Constitution. 
       Order No. 5 agreed. 
       Order No. 6 agreed. 
       Order No. 7 agreed. 
       ORDER No. 8. 
       The Chairman of a Joint Sitting of Seanad Eireann and Dail Eireann shall be the Ceann Comhairle of Dail Eireann.  The proceedings of every such Joint Sitting shall be governed by the Standing Orders of Dail Eireann, so far as they may be applicable to such Joint Sitting, and every question of the applicability of any Standing Order, or the adaptation thereof necessary or expedient for its application, shall be determined and ruled upon by the Chairman. 
    
    
      
       A question arises on that.  It may have been considered by the Committee, and I think it was.  I suggest that it might still be open to consideration.  &ldquo;The Chairman of the   Joint Sitting shall be the Ceann Comhairle of Dail Eireann.&rdquo;  I think it would be an act of grace if it were so arranged that you would have four chairmen&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle, or, in his absence, I suggest An Cathaoirleach; and, in his absence the Deputy Chairman of the Dail; and, in the absence of these three the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad. I think it would be an act of grace, and would not affect in any way the privileges of the Dail.  It has been put to me that it is a thing we ought to do here, not by anybody in touch with, or a member of the Seanad.  We have 128 members, and the other House is composed of 60 members, and when an election takes place the membership of the Dail will be 153, while the membership of the Seanad remains at 60, pending alteration of the Constitution, if such were ever contemplated.  I think the number of possible orators from the Dail would always be able to ambush any number of orators from the other House, so that this suggestion, I think, would be perfectly safe.  It would perhaps be looked upon as a graceful act, and, under all the circumstances, I do not think we stand to lose anything by it. 
    
    
      
       Apart from the matter of grace, there is a more practical consideration which puts the balance in the other direction.  The Constitution, and particularly the Articles of the Constitution moved by the President of the Executive Council, provide that the Seanad should make its own Standing Orders, and they may be very different from the Standing Orders of the Dail. The practices in the Seanad are very different from the practices in the Dail. The practices of the Chairman of the Seanad are very different from the practices of the Chairman of the Dail, and inasmuch as some Standing Orders must be made for a joint sitting, and inasmuch as the place of meeting must necessarily be the place of meeting of the Dail, the Committee thought the Standing Orders of the Dail ought to apply. 
    
    
      
       Certainly. 
    
    
      
       The President says certainly.  The Chairman must be a person who is familiar with the Standing Orders of the Dail and administer the rules governing the debate.  A new chairman unfamiliar with the Standing   Orders of the body over which he is to preside may make all kinds of blunders and cause a good deal of commotion in the conduct of debate, if there is not perfect harmony.  That is a practical consideration.  It seems to me to override the question of grace and courtesy. 
    
    
      
       It seems to me that the objections put up by the last speaker are very much in the nature of special pleading.  The joint sessions will be held for the purpose of debating but not voting upon proposals of any Bill or amendment, so that the Standing Orders which the chairman will be called upon to apply will be such as to be in the competence of any Chairman of the Seanad.  These joint sessions are something in the nature of conferences.  They are merely for the purpose of discussing things and perhaps arriving at a way out of some impasse that may have occurred; that is, the Seanad may be inclined to hold up a Bill for the period during which it can hold it up, unless it can get some concession.  On the other hand, the Dail may be very desirous that the Bill should be passed through without delay. It may be inclined to make some concession. These joint sittings will be for the purpose of arriving at an amicable way out of the difficulty that has arisen, and I think, in view of the purpose, if they are to serve any purpose, it would be well that the question of the courtesies should be observed.  It is not a very important matter, but certainly I think that, as regards any question of a joint sitting, it will not add to the possibility of it being fruitful, and other than a mere waste of time, if the Dail is to insist on claiming everything in the way not only of privilege, but of dignity. 
    
    
      
       I think it is certainly desirable to make some provision in the rule, instead of leaving it to chance.  I think the suggestion made by the President is as good as any other we are likely to come to.  Certainly some decision ought to be come to, because, look at the position we are in to-day.  Supposing a joint sitting were going on, and we were deprived of the services of our Ceann Comhairle.  There is no official Deputy available, and we would have the unpleasant difficulty of asking the Seanad and ourselves to vote between my colleague,   Deputy Nicholls, and myself, or some other member of this body.  I think it is desirable that the matter be provided for by rule, and it is very improbable that all the people will not be available for a joint sitting.  It also is not a very great concession, because it looks more on paper than it probably will be in practice.  A joint sitting will occur so seldom, and will be so important, that I think we can take it for granted that it will not be fixed for a time or date on which our own presiding officer will not be available.  Therefore, the Deputy Chairman will only be called upon to serve for the period of rest and refreshment during the joint sitting period, whenever that may be.  I think the proposal of the President will smooth the difficulty, and certainly make provision for a case that actually exists to-day if we happened to be holding a joint sitting and there were no available official Deputy in the Dail. 
    
    
      
       There is another aspect that has been lost sight of.  We cannot say that the Chairman of the joint sitting shall be a member of the Seanad.  These are the Standing Orders of the Dail, and we have been precluded from meeting the Seanad Committee for consideration of such matters as this. Therefore, we would be going outside our authority if we put into the Standing Orders a provision which said that the Chairman of the joint sitting of the Seanad and Dail should be someone outside the control of the Dail.  We should have to leave it in that case to the decision of the joint sitting.  In the absence of the Chairman of the Dail we should have to leave it to the joint sitting to decide who would be chairman of that sitting.  We cannot put into the Standing Orders a provision that an officer of another House shall be at the disposal of the Dail. 
    
    
      
       I think that argument could be carried further, and we could say that we, as one body, cannot decide who will be chairman at all at the joint sitting.  If there were to be any agreement on the matter, and if we were to take up the point of view that we must have our own way, and have nobody else, the Seanad would be entitled to say the same, and the matter, if it is to be provided   for at all, should be provided for, not by Standing Orders, but by legislation. 
    
    
      
       It is they who demand a joint sitting. 
    
    
      
       I am looking at the question apart entirely from personal consideration, apart from your own very capable administration of the office you hold as Ceann Comhairle, and apart from taking into consideration how the duties of the office are discharged in the other House.  I am looking at it from the point of view of Article 38 of the Constitution, which says that a Bill having been sent up from this House, and not being passed by the other House, a joint sitting shall take place.  Now, a joint sitting must obviously take place in a majority of cases on the initiative of the Seanad.  It is they who ask for it.  It is they who really wish to discuss, and to point out here what their objections to a particular measure may be.  Is it not reasonable, and is it not right, that if there should be any misgiving on their part regarding the putting of their case that there should be some provision on their side at some stage of the proceedings for their own Cathaoirleach presiding over the proceedings? I have come across in my time, as well as many others, difficult propositions as a chairman, and they did not terrorise me.  Generally, I manage to get through the ordinary business.  There might be cases where the Chairman of the Seanad might not act impartially.  I do not think it is at all likely in an assembly composed of the two most important bodies of the nation that any individual, no matter how strong-minded he might be, would attempt to abuse his office to such an extent as to prejudice the putting of cases by members of the Dail.  The Standing Orders must be the subject of consideration of any person who is likely to occupy the position of president over a joint sitting of the two Houses.  It will be really a debate which does not involve all the intricacies of the ordinary duties of a chairman of the Dail, and, as such, I would have no fear whatever. I do not believe that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad would abuse his office, and, even if he were to, I would have no fear for eventualities. 
    
    
      
       The President would not think of referring   these Standing Orders to a Joint Committee? 
    
    
      
       I think they ought to come from us; it ought to be our place to deal with them.  We brought the Constitution into being, we brought the Seanad into being, and we ought to have done all this at the commencement; but one cannot do more than twenty-four hours' work in a day, and it had to be left over. 
    
    
      
       When the Committee was discussing this matter it was indicated that we had no right to interfere in any way with what the Seanad might or might not do, and that we could not make any rules or regulations governing any member of the Seanad.  The obvious thing for us to do was to make rules for our own House.  If the Seanad asked us to make rules for their House, we would gladly have done so; but since we cannot bind them down in any way, the only thing we could do was to make our own rules and to stand by them.  We tried to get around this in various ways, but were always confronted with the statement that we could not interfere. 
    
    
      
       I am afraid that is not facing the question at all.  If we are entitled to say the Seanad shall obey the Standing Orders of the Dail when it comes to a joint sitting, we are equally entitled to say the Chairman of the Seanad shall occupy the Chair under certain circumstances.  These Orders are not binding on the Seanad unless the members of the Seanad care to accept them, and care, so far as they are concerned, to apply them to their own use. So far as it concerns the Seanad, anything we may do here is simply permissive and in the nature of giving an authority. Nothing that we can do, as far as I can see, can possibly be binding, and certainly we have no authority, apart from the concurrence of the Seanad, to draw up Orders for a joint sitting.  We are drawing them up in order to bind ourselves in the case of a joint sitting. 
    
    
      
       The conclusion one would draw from that argument is that we should not make any order relating to a joint sitting.  Is that the intention? 
    
    
      
       No.  The suggestion   is that we should put up what we think are reasonable Standing Orders for a joint sitting, on the assumption that the Seanad in their Standing Orders will do the same, and the difficulty that now arises may, perhaps, be got over.  We should not use the argument that we have no authority over the members of the Seanad, to prevent ourselves from doing anything that we might think it reasonable to do.  What we should have in mind in the present circumstances is what is a reasonable thing to do. 
    
    
      
       If the Dail draws up Standing Orders which, as the Minister suggests, are to be binding only on members of the Dail at a joint sitting, and the Seanad draws up Standing Orders which may not be the same as those of the Dail, and which will be binding, presumably, only on members of the Seanad, what is to happen at the joint sitting? 
    
    
      
       You would have a delightful time. 
    
    
      
       To my mind we have the matter in our hands in this way; if we have no power to make rules for a joint sitting, it is perfectly certain the Seanad has no power to make rules for a joint sitting.  Then it comes to this, that the joint sitting must make its own Standing Orders.  I think we have a clear vote of two to one in a joint sitting.  Therefore, it is clear that if we can agree here upon what we think are proper Standing Orders, we can carry them wherever the matter may be raised. 
    
    
      
       The matter is a very simple one, or should have been so from the outset; it has only become complex through special causes.  Is it not the normal procedure that decisions in matters of this kind should be taken by a committee representative of both Houses?  I think the best thing to be done in this matter would be that, to preclude the difficulties to which the Minister for Local Government has referred, which have been indicated by Deputy Shannon, that each House might draw up its own Standing Orders respecting joint sessions, and the members of each House obeying its own Standing Orders would lead to a state of chaos, the best thing would be to refer this to a joint committee of both Houses,   of which one half would be appointed now, and then an agreed conclusion could be brought to each House from such Joint Committee. 
    
    
      
       Do you move that as an amendment? 
    
    
      
       I will.  I move that this whole schedule,  (b)  2, be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses. 
    
    
      
       I second that. 
    
    
      
       My proposal was that after the words &ldquo;Dail Eireann' that you put &ldquo;In his absence the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad; in the absence of both, Leas-Cheann-Comhairle; and in the absence of the three, the Leas-Chathaoirleach.&rdquo;  That would be making provision for four. 
    
    
      
       I wonder would the suggestion be adopted that the President, with his well-known knowledge of order, should preside at the joint sessions, and solve the whole question? We are now discussing Standing Order No. 8, and the President has moved his amendment. 
    
    
      
       Is that amendment before the Dail and is it discussable? 
    
    
      
       Yes, sir. 
    
    
      
       We have here distinctly got a very important case that does affect rulings that will be of considerable effect hereafter.  We have stated that the Standing Orders for Dail Eireann shall be the Standing Orders of that joint session, and although it is perfectly true that no vote will be taken, and the matter be confined merely to debate, it is perfectly clear to anyone who has attended the meetings of the Seanad that they have developed on different lines of procedure there to what we have developed, and I think it is extremely likely that the tangent will be developed still more markedly by the continuance of each separate practice.  I fail to see how the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad will be able to interpret and apply, or, if necessary, adopt the Standing Orders of Dail Eireann, employing the procedure and practice of Dail Eireann under these   Standing Orders, if he is wholly unfamiliar with the Orders and with the practices and with the procedure.  The Committee, I imagine must have given very careful consideration to this on those lines, and, I think, it is perfectly clear that Standing Orders can only be interpreted by those to whom they are familiar, and those are the persons who have been in the habit of adjudicating upon them.  I do not see why such a course should in any way be considered tactless or discourteous to the Seanad. There is no question of tactlessness or discourtesy implied in the matter at all.  It is simply a question if the Chairman of the Seanad should in a particular case give a ruling that every member of the Dail knew to be contrary to the practice of the Dail, and if a member of the Dail were to arrive and state that such were the case, with the consent of his colleagues, in spite of the fact that the Chairman's ruling would be final, that the Chairman himself would be put in a very delicate and awkward position. 
    
    
      
       I think a lot of these objections to the President's amendment are based on the supposition that the Chairman of the Seanad will be a very ignorant individual.  It does not require a man of very great intelligence to understand our Standing Orders.  I think a man of ordinary intelligence ought to be able to understand them and rule accordingly.  Of course, if the Deputy assumes that the Chairman is likely to be an ignorant individual, of course, he is right.  I think you seem to strike a note of no confidence in yourselves, and that you are subordinate to the Seanad or somebody else.  If you make your orders, and these people come here, they have got to obey them.  I do not think there is any ground for discriminating here at all.  I think when you passed so many Standing Orders that you can also pass this one.  I do not see why you should strain at this at all.  There is no reason why you should.  I think it would be an act of courtesy more or less.  No doubt they are a lesser body in every way&mdash;in numbers, influence&mdash;&mdash; 
    
    
      
       And ability. 
    
    
      
       And legislative power&mdash; and even ability.  If it pleases the Deputies on the different sides, I will say that. 
    
     
    
      
       The only thing I am puzzled about is as to what Deputy Figgis is at.  I have looked through the rules of debate, and I do not find in any way that any person presiding over a meeting of the two Houses sitting together would be in a position to act unfairly towards anyone.  I do see here that the Chairman, in the event of a member misconducting himself, is under instructions to have the offending member removed.  I do not know if the Deputy has that in mind, that he would object to be removed on the order of the Chairman of the Seanad in the event of his misconducting himself; but there is nothing else in it.  It is not a question of resolutions, motions, and so on; it is only a question of relevancy to the subject under discussion, and it has nothing to do with the business; there is no finality about it.  It simply exhausts the subject which the Seanad, in its wisdom, thinks has not been sufficiently exhausted in the treatment before the Dail when the Bill has been under consideration, or that the Dail has not considered in the correct perspective whatever views the Seanad may have had on that particular Bill.  I do not know any way in which the Chairman could, without gravely abusing the Standing Orders, infringe on any member's liberty.  I do not know how, if it were likely that he should do such a thing, that with the knowledge that we have of the rules it would not be possible to bring it to his knowledge; and as, however, I expect there are more sensible men in the world than there are fools, like a sensible man the person occupying the Chair at that time can see at once the force of these remarks. 
    
    
      
       The President has misunderstood, in my opinion, the powers of the Seanad in respect of joint sittings. Their power is not so slight.  It is not merely to come and meet and discuss and affirm a single resolution.  The Constitution provides that for &ldquo;a Bill other than a Money Bill a joint sitting of the members of both Houses may, on a resolution passed by Seanad Eireann, be convened for the purpose of debating, but not of voting upon, the proposals of the Bill or any amendment of the same.&rdquo; Now, they may begin at Clause 1 and go right through.  That joint sitting   might continue for twenty-one days unless the Standing Orders of the Dail are made operative.  The Standing Orders of the Dail make provision for meeting members who are overstepping the bounds of order, for motions and amendments, and if the Chairman is not familiar with those Standing Orders, members who are inclined to be obstructive or to strain the Standing Orders to the utmost can make havoc with the business.  If it were simply a joint meeting to discuss a formal resolution it would be an entirely different matter; but here we have the phrase, &ldquo;for the purpose of debating the proposals of the Bill or any amendment of the same.&rdquo;  They may make it into a very big proposition and a long-continued one.  It all depends upon the Chairman if the Seanad decide that they are not going to agree with the Dail, that they are going to challenge a vote on every amendment that we wish to bring forward.  That is the motion that the President moved, and I am sure he must have had in mind the possibility that any question on any Bill might be brought forward, unless it is a Money Bill. 
    
    
      
       Well, if I have learned one lesson in my life, it is that debates similar to those on the Treaty will never take place again in this country. I think that they exhausted all the oratory in the country, and that nobody wants to see a repetition of them.  So much so, I think, that one man wrote in one of the Dublin papers that he went to confession and confessed that he had stolen a goat and the penance he got was to read the Dail speeches on the Treaty debate seven times.  That, I think, is our safeguard with regard to any prolongation of debate over these matters.  The Seanad, as I have seen it, is a body which does not want prolonged debates.  It does its business rather quickly, I think, and it did so any time I was there, and this Dail is of much the same character.  I have no fear of a prolongation of a debate of that sort, particularly in view of the experiences we have had. 
    
    
      
       I think it must be quite clear to the Dail that there is no substance at all in the points put forward by Deputy Johnson.  The object of a joint session would be to allow to members   of the Seanad an opportunity of convincing members of the Dail and converting them to their point of view on some particular business.  They will not do that by making long and unnecessary speeches.  As to having the thing continued from day to day, that is utterly impossible.  The Dail will, in response to a request from the Seanad, arrange for a joint sitting.  It will set apart a particular day, say a Tuesday, for the joint sitting, and there will be no meeting of the Dail on that day.  The meetings of the Dail will continue on the Wednesday, and the Seanad cannot possibly occupy this House without the consent of the Dail.  The joint session cannot continue when the Dail meets, so that the whole thing is pure nonsense. 
       Amendment put and carried. 
       Question put: &ldquo;That Order No. 8, as amended, stand part of the Schedule.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
    
    
      
       The debate having been concluded upon this very grave subject, I might now be allowed to say that, though my name is signed to this Report, and though I presided at all the meetings, I think, of the Committee, and as I am very much concerned myself in this particular Order, I want to make it clear that the form in which it is presented to the Dail is not a form suggested by me.  It has been suggested to me, as we have been so jocose, that we might have an excellent debate now as to who should be clerk to the joint sittings of the Dail and the Seanad.  That, however, I am afraid, will be out of order. 
    
    
      
       I suggest it should be discussed eventually by a joint Committee of both Houses. 
    
    
      
       Why not make it a new office? 
       Orders Nos. 9 and 10 were agreed to. 
       ORDER No. 11. 
    
    
      
       This procedure has already been adopted by the Seanad dealing with Bills coming from Dail Eireann.  They are assumed to have passed the first stage. 
    
    
      
       On the first stage of a Bill nobody knows what is in it.   Our first stage is for leave to introduce, and the Deputy responsible states generally what its provisions are, and then, when leave is given to introduce the Bill, it is printed.  In the case of a Bill that comes down to us from the Seanad, it will obviously be in print already, and it was for that reason that the Committee introduced this new Standing Order, in order to avoid going through the formality of asking leave to introduce and print a Bill which was already printed. 
    
    
      
       I presume it is understood that a Bill shall be circulated to members of the Dail. 
    
    
      
       That is in the Standing Orders. 
    
    
      
       Yes; the Standing Orders already provide that when a Bill passes its first stage it shall be circulated forthwith, so that when Bills come down from the Seanad they must be circulated under the Standing Orders. 
       Order No. 11 agreed to. 
       ORDER No. 12. 
    
    
      
       This Order provides that amendments or recommendations coming from the Seanad in the case of Bills shall be considered by the Dail in Committee without motion made under the Standing Orders.  That is the procedure we have already adopted in the case of the few Bills. 
       Order No. 12 agreed to. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - C.&mdash;AMENDMENTS MADE IN THE STANDING ORDERS ADOPTED ON 6TH DECEMBER, 1922. 
    
      
       The next set are amendments to the Standing Orders which the committee, in the light of their experience of the existing Standing Orders, think desirable.  The first four are merely dealing with names to substitute &ldquo;Dail Eireann&rdquo; for &ldquo;Dail&rdquo; throughout; to substitute &ldquo;Order Paper&rdquo; for &ldquo;Agenda,&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;President of the Executive Council&rdquo; for &ldquo;President of the Ministry,&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;Official Report of Debates of Dail Eireann&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;Official Report of the Dail.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I am not sure, but there is some confusion between our   proposed Amendment No. 3 and Standing Order No. 20.  The existing Standing Order 20 provides:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;If any question be not reached by 3.30 o'clock p.m., the Minister to whom it is addressed shall cause an answer to be provided in the Official Report of the Dail, unless the Teachta responsible for the question has signified his desire to postpone the question.&rdquo; 
       Now, it is suggested that these words should be changed to the words &ldquo;Official Report of the Debates of Dail Eireann,&rdquo; and that these should be substituted for what was called the &ldquo;Official Report of the Dail.&rdquo;  Now, when we come to No. 22, we find that we have to substitute the words &ldquo;Official Report of the Debates of Dail Eireann&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;Report of all Proceeding and Debates.&rdquo;  The proposed Standing Order covers the same ground. 
    
    
      
       Except as regards the title of that particular order. 
    
    
      
       Amendment No. 3 seems to me to cover the same ground as the proposed Order No. 22, with the exception of the heading. 
    
    
      
       We can amend No. 22 when we come to it if necessary, either by deleting it or otherwise. 
    
    
      
       With regard to the description, &ldquo;Official Report of the debates of Dail Eireann,&rdquo; would not the word &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; be better than &ldquo;debates&rdquo;?  There are other things as well as debates. 
    
    
      
       Oh, no; these are the official reports of the debates. We are at present getting out the &ldquo;Official Proceedings of Dail Eireann,&rdquo; which chronicle what happens in the Dail, and that is the official and legal report of what happens, and is taken from the Clerk's Journal.  That is a different thing. 
    
    
      
       When is it expected that such &ldquo;Proceedings&rdquo; will be available for Deputies?  I know, of course, your office is working at high pressure.  Would it be possible to have them every month? 
    
    
      
       They are provided every day in England.  The   votes and proceedings of the Dail from 9th September to the 6th December have been completed, and are with the printers, and will be ready shortly.  When the office has caught up with the Dail it will be for the Dail, or a Committee of the Dail, to consider how often they would like to have these reports of the official proceedings circulated&mdash;that is to say, whether they would like to have them every day, which would be very difficult, or weekly or monthly, or otherwise. Those of the Provisional Parliament will be circulated shortly. 
       Amendments 1, 2, 3, and 4 agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 5. 
    
    
      
       On reading Amendment No. 5, I notice its exact sense is that if there was a panel of two Teachtai they could not be called upon to preside in the Dail.  I do not think the Committee quite adverted to that. 
    
    
      
       I do not think that could be read into the Order.  The Order says: &ldquo;In the case of the absence of the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Dail Eireann may, on motion made without notice, appoint a Teachta to act as Ceann Comhairle for the time being.&rdquo;  It is obvious the Dail will do that.  The Order again says: &ldquo;The Ceann Comhairle shall nominate, at the commencement of every session, a panel of not less than two Teachtai, of whom one shall act as temporary Chairman of Committees of the whole Dail, when requested to do so by the Ceann Comhairle.&rdquo;  Is it not assumed there that such Chairman shall act as temporary Chairman of Committees, as well as Chairman of the Dail, when necessary? 
    
    
      
       My reading of it is that it is exclusive: that the two Teachtai placed on the Panel can only be called on to preside over the Dail in Committee, and that when the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle are absent for any reason,  will be necessary to have a motion moved in order to put some one in the chair in the Dail. 
    
    
      
       Is that to be distinct from the Dail in Committee? 
    
    
      
       Yes, exactly. 
    
     
    
      
       I was going to suggest that was the difficulty that arose just before Christmas, when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was unable to attend here.  You may remember that for two consecutive nights, when we were sitting from 3 o'clock to 8.30 p.m., the Ceann Comhairle was in the chair the whole time, without being able to leave for tea or anything else, because there was no rule which enabled anyone to take his place.  He was not absent, and, therefore, Standing Order No. 3 did not come into operation.  My impression is that when we passed Standing Order No. 3, what we had in our mind was the possibility of the Dail assembling here and finding neither the Ceann Comhairle or his Deputy on the spot, and of then electing somebody to take the chair, in order to go on with the business.  I think it would be well to make provision of the kind that we have been working upon lately without any Standing Order to meet it.  This proposed Standing Order does not quite do that.  It is entirely for the Dail to say whether it would be better to let the Ceann Comhairle himself nominate two Deputies who could take the chair temporarily, as the Deputy Nicholls and myself have been doing for half an hour or so in the evenings lately, or whether the Dail itself should nominate at the beginning of the session, two Teachtai who should act in the case of both the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle being absent, or in case of the Ceann Comhairle being present and desiring to vacate the chair for half an hour.  I do not care who does it, but, I think, it would be more convenient that at the begnning of the Session we should nominate two Teachtai who could be called on temporarily in a case of necessity, rather than that it should be left to the Ceann Comhairle to get up himself in the chair and say he was tired and wanted to go away for half an hour. I think the Dail itself should appoint someone, and I do not think that duty ought to be imposed upon the Ceann Comhairle.  I think he ought to have the right, as he has been permitted lately to have it, to ask someone to take his place. Whether that person should be nominated by the Dail, or by the Ceann Comhairle himself, I have not endeavoured to form any opinion on it. 
    
     
    
      
       Would there be any objection to insert the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;Dail&rdquo; in the second last line of the Order? 
    
    
      
       If the second sentence were to read that &ldquo;the Ceann Comhairle shall nominate at the commencement of every session a panel of not less than two Teachtai, of whom one shall act as temporary Ceann Comhairle or Chairman of the whole Dail when requested to do so by the Ceann Comhairle,&rdquo; would that meet the difficulty? 
    
    
      
       I think it would. If the Dail assembled, and found no authorised chairman was present, they could then elect some temporary chairman to go on with the business. 
    
    
      
       In that case I suggest you are making provision twice for the same thing. 
    
    
      
       Yes; we do not need the first sentence in the Order now.  With the suggested change the first sentence appears redundant. 
    
    
      
       I would think not, because you provide that these two Deputies only act on the request of the Ceann Comhairle.  I put the case, that supposing the Ceann Comhairle got a sudden attack of influenza, and were not here, he would not be in the position to make the request.  It would then fall on the Dail itself to elect a chairman to preside over the meeting. 
    
    
      
       What I am not quite clear about is:&mdash;Whether, in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle from the Dail, he has the right to say that a particular Deputy shall preside. I am not quite clear that he has, even though the Deputy is on the Panel. 
    
    
      
       As the motion stood it seems clear to me that, when we were dealing with meetings of the Dail as such, in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle or his Deputies, the Dail must appoint a substitute.  That is certainly the intention as I see it now, and the Panel was to be a sessional arrangement for Committee work.  I gather now from Deputy Fitzgibbon that he favours the proposal that the Panel should be formed at the beginning of the session, even for meetings of the Dail.  Whether that is desirable or not I have no particular   opinion.  Perhaps it might be wiser to leave it as it stands, and, in the absence of the two appointed Deputies, the Dail itself should appoint a substitute for meetings of the Dail.  In practice it will probably result in the Chairman of the Committee, or at least one of the Panel Teachta, being appointed. 
    
    
      
       I think it would be very confusing to have two sorts of procedure &mdash;one for the Dail and another for the Dail in Committee. 
    
    
      
       They are two different types of cases altogether. We have already agreed to an amendment of this Order, which would enable the Ceann Comhairle to call on his Deputy, or, in the absence of the Deputy, on one or other of the Teachtai on the Panel to preside either in the Dail or in Committee.  That, I think, is agreeable to everybody; but when the Ceann Comhairle or his Deputy are absent the Dail should itself appoint a substitute, that is the question.  If you leave the Order as it has been amended now, it will provide that the Dail itself will appoint a substitute in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle or his Deputy, but that the Ceann Comhairle will have the power himself when present. 
    
    
      
       I should like to have the Order read in its amended form. 
    
    
      
       The Order as amended reads:&mdash;&ldquo;In the case of the absence of the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Dail Eireann may, on motion made without notice, appoint a Teachta to act as Ceann Comhairle for the time being.  The Ceann Comhairle shall nominate at the commencement of every session a panel of not less than two Teachtai, of whom one shall act as temporary Ceann Comhairle or Chairman of Committees of the whole Dail, when requested so to do by the Ceann Comhairle.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I do not think there is much to be gained by appointing a panel of two Teachtai at the beginning of the session, or rather of nominating a panel, when you yourself will, on occasion, nominate the Teachta who is to act.  I think you are rather restricting your choice, and that it is quite on the   cards that the two Teachtai nominated at the beginning of the session may be absent. 
    
    
      
       Does the Deputy propose that the Ceann Comhairle should have power to put any Deputy he pleases in the chair? 
    
    
      
       I think it amounts to that; if you nominate a panel at the beginning of the session you have power to put in the chair any Deputy you wish. 
    
    
      
       That was not the sense of my remark.  Does the Deputy object to the panel being reduced to two, or does he object to the nomination by the Ceann Comhairle? 
    
    
      
       I think two is very small. 
    
    
      
       It is to be not less than two. 
    
    
      
       The Deputy must remember there is always the possibility that the Ceann Comhairle may fail to indicate one or other of the panel for some reason or other, and the Order now will leave it to the Dail to appoint a Chairman without notice.  I think that is the intention. 
       Amendment 5 agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 6. 
    
    
      
       This is provided for in the Constitution.  This amendment is to delete Order No. 4. 
       Agreed. 
       AMENDMENT 7. 
       Order No. 10, to insert after this Order the two following:&mdash; 
       (1)  &ldquo;A motion that Dail Eireann shall sit later than 8.30 o'clock on any evening may be made without notice and not later than 6.30 o'clock p.m. on the same evening.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays this Motion shall be made only by a Minister.&rdquo; 
       (2)  &ldquo;A motion that Dail Eireann do adjourn for a period not exceeding two hours may, at any time, be made by permission of the Ceann Comhairle, and without notice.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I was suggesting some time ago that we should adjourn at six o'clock in the evening.  If we substitute   6 o'clock for 8.30 it would be more desirable, but I suppose it is out of order to make that suggestion now? 
    
    
      
       No. 
    
    
      
       In view of the wording of Standing Order No. 10, I think Deputies generally were more or less satisfied that we should wind up at 6 o'clock.  It certainly gives us an opportunity of doing other business. The day is occupied entirely with the Dail, and there is very limited time for doing other business.  I was informed by some of the Deputies that 6 o'clock suited them better than 8.30.  I suggest to substitute 6 o'clock.  It would mean putting in 6 o'clock in the Standing Orders where 8.30 p.m. occurs at present. 
    
    
      
       I think that is not advisable.  A three-hour day is not sufficient for this kind of work. 
    
    
      
       What about the bricklayers? 
    
    
      
       Constituents would be objecting to the work of the bricklayers. It may, of course, be very trying to Ministers, but in any case a three-hour day is not sufficient, and I think it is far better to leave the matter as it stands at present, and if the Ministers find that it is desirable to adjourn the sitting about 6 or 6.30 o'clock, and if there is nothing pressing, well, it might be conceded while the need lasts.  But I should expect that there will be quite a good deal of legislation afoot.  A number of Bills have been promised, and there are a number more that have not been promised, but that are necessary, and they may take a considerable time for discussion.  I would urge that the present arrangements be not altered in the Standing Orders. 
    
    
      
       We can fairly say to the Deputy's suggestion that the bricklayer is concerned only with getting certain articles presented to his hand by other people.  He is not like a Deputy or Minister in this Dail who may have to consider for an hour or two or three or four in the morning before he starts work the particular method of regulating the bricks he may adopt during the day.  It is well known that some subjects that   we have under discussion here would, in order to be ready for them, require very much more study than the time spent here permits.  That has been my experience. 
    
    
      
       I think it would be unwise to make an amendment to Standing Order No. 10 without considering Standing Order No. 58.  It is only in the later part of the day, and only on two days of the week, that a private member's Bill can be proceeded with, and if we were to make a general Standing Order for adjournment at six o'clock, the effect of that would be practically to wipe out private members' business altogether. 
    
    
      
       It was not my intention to do that. 
    
    
      
       Of course I know it was not; but we went through these Orders, and it was on that account I had Order 58 in my mind.  You would either have to give private members the whole day on Wednesday or Friday, or else you would have to provide in your Standing Order that Wednesday and Friday would be excepted from the days that we rise at six o'clock.  I would suggest to the President that we will get along all right as we have been going.  Nobody will endeavour to force Ministers to go on sitting until eight o'clock if they express any real desire to rise earlier.  It is always in their power to adjourn at six o'clock if they like.  We must guard the rights of private members as much as possible, because there will be a certain amount of private members' business coming on later, and it should not be in the power of the Dail to shelve private members' business by forcing the Dail to sit late in order to discharge it.  The kind of business brought forward by private members is of such a nature that it only interests a small minority of the population, and if a private member is forced to get up and move that the Dail sit longer in order to do the private member's business, the result will be that human nature will prevail and we will not do it. 
    
    
      
       Am I to understand that the President is not pressing that suggestion? 
    
     
    
      
       I am not. 
    
    
      
       There is a point of construction which arises very frequently on Standing Order No. 10. Suppose notice is given that a matter will be raised on the adjournment and the adjournment is proposed at 6 o'clock, can the debate go on until 8.30, or until people are tired of talking, whichever is the earlier, or is it the intention of this Standing Order that the debate shall be restricted to half an hour?  I have been interpreting it in that way, and I understand there is some objection to that interpretation. It is a matter of indifference to me, but I would like to have the exact meaning of the Order made clear to everybody. 
    
    
      
       When I made the suggestion that we adjourn at 6 o'clock, it was my intention that we would regard 6 o'clock as 8.30 o'clock, in accordance with the Standing Order, and that we would discuss a matter for half an hour, no vote being taken after 6 o'clock.  That is&mdash;the debate will continue for half an hour.  There has been no actual insistence on that Order, but that was the intention. I put it to Deputies that it would be quite possible for one, two or three members to hold us here until 9 o'clock, if we took any other construction of it, on almost any subject. 
    
    
      
       Whatever argument may be used in favour of that rule on Tuesdays and Thursdays it should not prevail on Wednesdays and Fridays. 
    
    
      
       I take it that if the Government intended to restrict the hours of meeting on the days for Private Members' business or motions, they would have to come to an agreement with the Private Members concerned. They would have to arrange that the rights of Private Members having business down for Wednesday or Friday would not be infringed. 
    
    
      
       The number of hours must be retained, I would urge, for Private Members' motions. 
    
    
      
       That does not apply to matters raised on the adjournment. 
    
    
      
       It would, if a motion   for adjournment was moved at 6 o'clock on Wednesday. 
    
    
      
       It could not be moved before a Private Member's motion.  Any business by a Private Member would have to come on before the adjournment could be moved.  Therefore, the matter would not arise at all. 
    
    
      
       I take it, A Chinn Chomhairle, that your point refers to a debate on the adjournment&mdash;whether it should be confined to half an hour or extend over the half hour? 
    
    
      
       Yes. 
    
    
      
       I think the practice that has prevailed is a good enough practice. If there is a strong desire on the part of the members to exceed the half-hour, and there is no opposition to it, it might very well be allowed to extend a little longer. 
       Amendment No. 7 was agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT No. 8. 
    
    
      
       This is merely a verbal alteration, and is intended to improve the English. 
       Agreed. 
       AMENDMENT No. 9. 
    
    
      
       This amendment provides that &ldquo;Order No. 23 shall end after the word `number,' &rdquo; the effect of that being to enable any Deputy to ask a supplementary question. 
    
    
      
       That is a tall order. 
    
    
      
       It was pointed out at the Committee&mdash;and I would like Deputies to be clear about it &mdash;that on this rule that we are adopting in the new form, so that any Deputy can ask a supplementary question, there can be no point of order raised on a ruling from the Chair as to the number of supplementary questions or matters of that kind. 
    
    
      
       Would the Ceann Comhairle have a right to stop an excessive number of supplementaries? 
    
    
      
       That is the point I am making.  The Committee were quite clear about that. 
       Amendments 9, 10, and 11 agreed to 
    
     
        The Chair was at this stage taken by Seoirse Mac Niocaill. 
     Amendments Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 were put and agreed to without discussion. 
    
      
       I would like to know the interpretation of Clause 2 of Amendment 15&mdash;&ldquo;Every Teachta present, when his name is called in a division, must record his vote.&rdquo;  Does that mean present within the building, or within this particular House? 
    
    
      
       It means in this particular House. 
    
    
      
       Some of the Deputies have a fashion of going outside the door when there is a division&mdash;one or two in particular&mdash;and that is the reason why I would like to have this thing defined. 
    
    
      
       The meaning is &ldquo;in this House.&rdquo; 
       Amendments 18 and 19 were agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 20. 
       Order No. 51, to substitute the words &ldquo;two-thirds&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;a majority.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Standing Order 51 provides: &ldquo;In case of special emergency any Teachta may move that all visitors and Press representatives be excluded from the Dail, and this shall be done by direction of the Ceann Comhairle, with the assent of a majority of the Teachtai present.&rdquo;  The proposed Standing Order suggests that there must be two-thirds of those present voting in favour of the exclusion of visitors and representatives of the Press.  The Committee so recommended, but I think it is desirable that we should state the Order which we propose to amend so that Deputies might understand what they are doing. 
    
    
      
       The Deputy should probably point out that the Constitution itself provides for a two-thirds majority, and the Standing Order, as it originally stood, is in discord with the Constitution. 
       Amendment 20 agreed to. 
       Amendments 21, 22 and 23 were agreed to. 
    
     
        AMENDMENT 24. 
     Order No. 59, to substitute the words &ldquo;disposed of &rdquo; for the word &ldquo;passed&rdquo; in line 2. 
    
      
       Order 59, line 2, states: &ldquo;If any motion by a private Teachta be not passed, or if leave to introduce any Bill be not given.&rdquo;  It is quite obvious that a motion might be rejected, and in that case it would be absurd to go on, as the rule provides that a further day shall be fixed for the discussion of the motion. 
    
    
      
       I wonder would there not need to be a further deletion from the rule, because if leave to introduce a Bill before 8.30 p.m. was definitely refused, it would not be necessary to proceed further. 
    
    
      
       The amendment would fit in better in this way.  &ldquo;If any motion by a private Teachta be not disposed of before 8.30 p.m., the Dail shall fix a day for further consideration.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       A question arises here.  If a notice of motion is on the agenda and that particular item on the agenda has not been arrived at before 8.30, the original proposal provided that that item on the agenda should be brought forward to the next occasion.  It is desirable to preserve that. 
    
    
      
       You will see that that is provided for later. 
       (At this stage the Ceann Comhairle resumed the chair.) 
    
    
      
       Is it necessary to leave in the words &ldquo;leave to introduce any Bill&rdquo;?  A Bill cannot be introduced except by motion.  &ldquo;Motion&rdquo; would cover that. 
    
    
      
       The words can be deleted in the Order. 
    
    
      
       I think so.  I was handing in an amendment. 
    
    
      
       &ldquo;If any motion by a private Teachta be not disposed of before 8.30 p.m., the Dail shall fix a day,&rdquo; and so on.  Quite so.  It is a much better Order now. 
       Amendment 24 agreed to. 
       Amendment 25 was also agreed to. 
    
     
        AMENDMENT 26. 
    
      
       Order 64&mdash;&ldquo;The matters which shall be dealt with by Bills shall include all proposals for legislation.&rdquo;  The rest of the Order is covered in the Financial Order. 
       Amendment 26 agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 27. 
    
    
      
       It was thought that Orders 62, 63, and 64 could be put into one Order, as they are now amended. 
       Amendment 27 agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 28. 
       Order No. 65, line 8, to delete the words &ldquo;or debate.&rdquo;  To substitute the word &ldquo;initiated&rdquo; for &ldquo;introduced.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       The object of this Order was to enable the Dail to have some small debate on a motion for leave to introduce a Bill.  We had it here before. The original Order stated that a motion for leave to introduce a Bill shall be decided without amendment or debate. The question arose when some private Bill was moved a few weeks ago, and the first question asked was, &ldquo;Can anybody lawfully state reasons why the Bill should be moved at all?&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       &ldquo;When a Bill is to be initiated in,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;introduced into.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I do not want to object, but I would like to know why &ldquo;initiate&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;introduce.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       &ldquo;Initiate,&rdquo; because it begins here in the Dail. &ldquo;Introduced&rdquo; might mean &ldquo;from the Seanad.&rdquo; 
       Amendment 28 agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 29. 
       Order No. 67 to be combined with Orders Nos. 68 and 77  (d).  
    
    
      
       A certain redundancy was noticed in these Orders, and it was suggested that a new Order should be put in in this form.  The reference to 77  (d)  and any further references   to 77 which occur arose from the fact that instead of giving a group of things which happen under the present 77, we took them out and put them in their proper place. 
       Amendment 29 agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 30. 
       Order No. 72.&mdash;To insert after the word &ldquo;preamble&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and title.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       &ldquo;Shall&rdquo; should also be inserted instead of &ldquo;may.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I think so. 
       Agreed. 
       Amendment 30 agreed to. 
       Amendment 31 agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 32. 
       Order No. 74 to read:&mdash;&ldquo;When a Bill has been returned from a Special Committee or from the Dail sitting in Committee, notice shall be given of a motion to receive the Bill for final consideration. On the fourth stage amendments may be moved, but when in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle an amendment proposed on the fourth stage is one of substance, or introduces new matter into the Bill, the Bill shall be recommitted for consideration of such section or sections as, in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle, are affected.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Order 74 is to meet a point that was already raised in connection with some of the Bills we have been already discussing.  I would like Deputies to give it some consideration, because it gives me certain powers. 
    
    
      
       There is one point, but I take it that it is not very likely to arise.  If amendments are proposed on the Fourth Stage and a Bill is recommitted for consideration, for instance, and if the amendments are passed would it be possible to proceed with that stage without having the matter again put on the agenda?  This recommittal of a Bill, I take it, will not mean a greater delay than would occur at present. 
    
    
      
       I think the intention of the Committee was, and I think it should be generally approved, that if an amendment of substance is introduced on   the Fourth Stage after discussion in Committee, then whatever time is necessary to insert amendments to that new form should be allowed.  It might mean delay, but it is intended that there should be some check upon the bringing forward of important matters on the Fourth Stage This is one of the checks.  If there is general agreement, then the usual procedure can be agreed to, and the Standing Orders may be suspended for that particular purpose.  It is intended that there should be some check upon the production of substantial amendments on the Fourth Stage of the Bill. 
    
    
      
       I quite accept what Deputy Johnson has said.  It has hitherto frequently happened that what are in fact and in practice substantial amendments are really amendments introduced as a result of discussion, and, perhaps, compromise, in the Committee Stage. They are hardly parallel with what I might consider new amendments. 
    
    
      
       The Committee considered that.  For example, on a Bill to be considered to-morrow, the Minister for Local Government has an amendment down&mdash;I think it is to abolish all disqualifications for outdoor relief.  That is an important amendment. It was put down by the Minister in response to an agreement in Committee that all disqualification should be removed. In that case if anybody asks for an expression of opinion from the Ceann Comhairle, whether it was a new matter, the Bill would be recommitted.  I pointed out to the Committee on Procedure that these Standing Orders mean that any Deputy who asked for that opinion and got it, that it was a new matter or an amendment of substance, would be entitled to claim that the Standing Orders should be put into operation. 
    
    
      
       The main object, I think, was that when an amendment with substance in it was introduced, the matter comes under the rules of debate of the Dail, which prevent anyone speaking more than once upon it.  When you are discussing the wording of a new section it very often happens that one wants to add a few words to what one has said in an amendment, or to correct something that has been put in.  That is more than a verbal explanation, and it is to   provide that the rules of debate in Committee shall apply in what is really Committee work&mdash;the moving of a new clause or substantial amendment.  I do not think it is intended that a great delay should be caused in the consideration of a Bill, and my impression was that it would work like this: A new amendment is introduced; some members suggest we should go into Committee; that is agreed, and when it has been considered on rules governing debate in Committee we should then report at once to the Dail, and go on with the Fourth Stage in the ordinary way. 
    
    
      
       I think that was understood. The only thing is that Rule 74 prescribes that when a Bill is returned from the Committee notice shall be given to receive it for final consideration. I was wondering if it might be thought that a new notice would be required. 
    
    
      
       I think it might.  I think we should be quite clear.  If an important amendment is introduced on the Fourth stage, and on motion the matter is referred to Committee, discussed in Committee, and passed, the Bill then takes upon itself a form different from that in which it emerged from the ordinary Committee Stage.  If members demand it, I think they should be allowed time to bring forward an amendment on the Report Stage, following the rules of Report Stage.  I think it would not happen very often.  I think it is an exceptional case that would arise; but the liberty ought to be there.  If an important amendment is concluded in a new Committee Stage, then the proceedings that are set down for the consideration of the Bill in Committee and on Report ought to apply, except by general leave. 
    
    
      
       If you wanted to do that, Deputy Johnson's difficulty would be met, if, on the motion to report back to the Dail, the Dail was of opinion that we ought not to report back at once, we could report back on the Thursday of the following week or so. That would give the Dail an opportunity to have complete control over its whole procedure.  The point of substance in this amendment is that when new matter   was being discussed, we should discuss it under the rules governing Committee Stage.  Then, when we move to report that Committee work back to the Dail, if the Dail as a whole thought it ought not to be dealt with at once, and that further time should be allowed, it would be within the power of the Dail so to decide. 
    
    
      
       This is a very valuable amendment, because we already have had experience of the necessity of being at liberty, even at this final stage, to alter in substantial respects some things left in because of oversight. I would like to suggest that when an amendment, such as is contemplated in this suggestion arises, where a Bill has come from a special Committee, it should not be recommitted to the special Committee, but to a Committee of the whole Dail.  The reason for that is that if the necessity for this amendation has escaped notice until this last stage has been reached, it is something about which it is desirable that the Dail as a whole should have an opportunity to consider and debate.  As regards this further portion that has not yet been touched on: In the case of a Bill returned from the Dail sitting in Committee, any amendment previously returned shall be in order, it is possible to draft an amendment in such wise that it would defy the wit even of the present distinguished occupant of the Chair to decide that it was an amendment already rejected. I would like to have the words &ldquo;no amendment or any colourable equivalent of it, in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle, shall be in order.&rdquo; Just as we have given discretionary power to the Chairman to decide whether or not an amendment moved is one of substance and should be reconsidered, we ought to specifically state that it is for the determination of the Chairman, and that his decision shall be final, as to whether an amendment brought forward is in effect an amendment already disposed of by rejection.  Otherwise, unless we give the power of final decision to the Chairman, it would mean a waste of time, and we might have debate upon debate on the matter. 
    
    
      
       I think he has the power under the Standing   Order.  The question raised by Deputy Magennis is one upon which I would like to have the opinion of some members of the Committee on Procedure.  It is, whether when a Bill is returned from Committee this proposed Standing Order means recommittal to a Special Committee or to the whole Dail.  That point has, I think, been overlooked, and it has to be decided. 
    
    
      
       I think that is covered by Order 67: It can go to a Special Committee or a Committee of the whole House, as the order for recommittal provides. 
    
    
      
       That is leaving it to be decided in each particular case? 
    
    
      
       When the motion to recommit came on, the proposal would be: new matter is being introduced into this Bill, and I propose it would be re-committed to either the Committee that dealt with it already&mdash;which of course would hang it up&mdash;or to a Committee of the whole House, when we could all debate the new matter. 
    
    
      
       That is why I would like it to be recommitted to a Committee of the whole House on every occasion, and not recommit it to a special Committee. 
    
    
      
       The recommittal is mandatory, I would like to point out.  &ldquo;The Bill shall be recommitted&rdquo;&mdash;not on motion made.  A motion to recommit could be defeated.  The Standing Order contemplates compulsory recommittal. 
    
    
      
       Yes. 
    
    
      
       Shall we put in &ldquo;to a Committee of the whole House?&rdquo;  It would be the most expeditious way. 
    
    
      
       It would be obviously the right thing to do, because the Bill was being considered in the whole Dail. 
    
    
      
       It might have been returned from a Special Committee. 
    
    
      
       Deputy Fitzgibbon points out in support of my contention   that at this stage it is now before the Dail.  Is it not desirable to keep it before the whole Dail? 
    
    
      
       There might be certain classes of Bills that it would be desirable to send for Committee consideration, not of the whole Dail, but of the Special Committee once again. 
    
    
      
       If we said that the Bill should be recommitted to the Special Committee, or to the Committee of the whole Dail, as may be decided by the Dail? 
    
    
      
       I do think it would be better, in spite of what the Minister for Local Government said, that it be provided that the Bill shall be re-committed to the whole Dail for this reason; obviously the new amendment would be brought up for consideration by the whole Dail, and not by the Special Committee, because it is moved in the whole Dail.  Presumably it is an amendment of a kind that the whole Dail would be considered a proper tribunal to deal with.  It would save time, and it is difficult to conceive circumstances under which, after a Bill had been thrashed out in a Special Committee and had come up on the Fourth Stage, it would be necessary to send back to the Special Committee for consideration an amendment that had been brought along in the First Stage. 
    
    
      
       As against that the Special Committee has had the whole discussion, and would understand better what change had taken place in the balance of the Bill, and the effect of the new amendment on certain preceding clauses.  That may be better discussed in the Special Committee than in the Committee of the whole Dail.  I think it should be left open for the Dail to decide whether it should be re-committed to the Special Committee or discussed by the Dail in Committee. 
    
    
      
       On consideration of the new Order as it stands without amendment, it seems to me it would be open to re-commit the Bill either to a Special Committee or a Committee of the whole Dail, as decided by the Dail.  That is the effect of the Order as it stands, because, speaking from the   point of view of the Chair, if we decide the Bill is to be re-committed, it would have to be left to the Dail whether to re-commit the Bill to a Special Committee or a Committee of the whole Dail.  I think that is so. 
    
    
      
       Very well. 
    
    
      
       Does not Order 66 cover that? 
    
    
      
       Yes. 
    
    
      
       What about the grammer of it?  Instead of &ldquo;such section or sections as are affected,&rdquo; I would suggest &ldquo;such section or sections as, in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle, the amendment affects.&rdquo;  That meets all the requirements. 
    
    
      
       Deputy Magennis's point is covered in the rule as it stands.  I think &ldquo;are affected&rdquo; seems to me much better.  I think the point raised by Deputy Magennis is covered by the Order as it stands. 
       Amendment 32 put and agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 33. 
       To insert after Order No. 76 the following:&mdash;&ldquo;76A. Any Bill not enacted within the Session then current may, upon resolution of Dail Eireann, be carried over in any completed stage to the next Session.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I have a difficulty with regard to 33.  It may be because I have not been studying the Standing Orders with sufficient closeness. &ldquo;Any Bill not enacted within the Session then current.&rdquo;  Now, that description would cover a Bill which had left the Dail, or was about to leave the Dail, for consideration by the Seanad, and it is to be carried over in any incompleted stage to the next Session.  It really comes under a new category altogether. I think what the framers of the Order intended is that any Bill which is incomplete may be carried over in such stage of completion as has been reached to the next Session. 
    
    
      
       Any Bill which has not passed through all its stages? 
    
    
      
       &ldquo;Not disposed   of,&rdquo; because otherwise we would be in the same difficulty as we were with motions not passed, because a Bill that was rejected would be a Bill that was not passed.  &ldquo;Any Bill&rdquo; not disposed of &ldquo;within the Session then current.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       The suggestion is to delete the word &ldquo;enacted&rdquo; and put in &ldquo;disposed of.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Supposing there is an election in the interval, that case ought to be met. 
    
    
      
       The Session is a Session of the existing Parliament. 
    
    
      
       There might be quite a meritorious Bill not affecting politics at all.  Would it not be a reasonable thing that it should continue in the new Dail after the general election?  Of course if a general election changes the complexion of the Dail the new Dail might hurl out any Bill which is carried over, partially completed, but the object of this rule was to prevent the necessity of going through all the stages again, even in a new Parliament, of a Bill that had gone a fair distance or one that had come to an untimely end.  The new Dail will have full control over any legislation that comes before it. 
    
    
      
       Can we bind the new Dail to accept any Standing Order of this kind? 
    
    
      
       Yes; I think so. Those are Standing Orders for all time until they are repealed, or if they are not, they can be re-enacted at the beginning of the next Session. 
       Amendment 33 agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 34. 
       &ldquo;Order No. 77, to delete this Order, amending the relevant Orders.&rdquo; 
       Agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 35. 
       &ldquo;Order No. 78, to delete being included in the subjoined Orders on Financial Procedure.&rdquo; 
       Agreed to. 
       AMENDMENT 36. 
       &ldquo;Order No. 79, to read `A Ministerial motion proposed....&rdquo; 
       Agreed to. 
    
     
        AMENDMENT 37. 
     Order No. 80 to read:&mdash;&ldquo;Ministerial business on the Order Paper for any day which has not yet been reached, shall, without notice....&rdquo; 
     Agreed to. 
     AMENDMENT 38. 
     To insert after No. 81 the following:&mdash; Papers laid on the Table of Dail Eireann. 
     81A.  &ldquo;All Papers and Documents laid on the Table shall be considered public.&rdquo; 
     81B.  &ldquo;A Committee shall be appointed at the beginning of every Session to examine all Orders, Regulations or Documents submitted to Dail Eireann in pursuance of any Statute, and shall, if they consider it necessary, report to Dail Eireann thereon.  Every such report shall be made available for discussion in Dail Eireann before the expiration of the time (if any) during which such Orders, Regulations or Documents lie upon the Table.&rdquo; 
    
      
       81A comes from consideration of a matter that was raised, and which it was promised, would be considered by the Committee on Procedure. 
    
    
      
       Perhaps it would be well to explain the purpose of this suggestion&mdash;81B. It is that there shall be appointed a Committee at the beginning of the Session which shall have the duty thrust upon it of examining the Orders laid upon the Table of the Dail in accordance with the provisions of Acts of Parliament, and that it shall report, if it thinks well, to the Dail on the matter. 
    
     At present Orders are laid upon the Table, and, of course, it is optional for every Deputy, one might even go so far as to say that it is the duty of every Deputy to examine these Orders and compare them, and see what they connote and see whether they are within the bounds or intentions of the legislature. Deputies do not, and never will do that, and cannot be expected to do it.  But if a Committee is set up which shall consider it its duty to examine these Orders, and report on them if necessary, I think it will be found that the future legislation would admit with more readiness a provision that Regulations might be made by Order than if there were no   such Committee.  The Committee on Procedure consider that a Committee of this kind, having such a duty, would help to facilitate the business, and would prevent motions, perhaps, being brought forward by individual members objecting to certain regulations simply because they did not understand them.  If a committee of this kind were appointed it would be able to find out the meaning of such regulations and orders, and probably would save a good deal of time for the Dail, which otherwise would be wasted by private members initiating debates on matters which they did not thoroughly understand.  I think the proposal is a wise one, and will add to the business procedure of the Dail. 
    
      
       I was just wondering what was meant by the expression &ldquo;shall be made available for discussion in the Dail.&rdquo;  Does it mean that every such report shall be printed and circulated to members of the Dail? 
    
    
      
       It does, I think. 
    
    
      
       I think perhaps it would be well to be specific in the matter. 
    
    
      
       I am very sorry that, so far as I understand this motion, and it has been recommended by Deputy Johnson, it seems to me to make for a waste rather than for an economy of time.  Observe what is to happen.  In accordance with some Statute, an Order is laid upon the Table of the Dail.  Unless objected to and defeated by a specific resolution, within 21 days it becomes operative.  Now, here a machine is created by which a Committee of a number not decided, and constituted in a way not determined, is to submit this Order to critical examination and to report upon it, and that report is to be circulated and become itself in turn a subject for debate.  Now we will assume that there is a majority and a minority report possible in this matter.  Each of the reports, of course, is to be circulated, and a debate upon these&mdash;why, this is simply multiplying work.  Deputy Johnson said that it was the duty of every member to make himself acquainted with the documents laid upon the Table of the Dail.  I cordially agree,   but a moment later he said&mdash;perhaps this is captious criticism&mdash;that the ordinary member could not be expected to do that, that is, he cannot be expected to do what is his plain duty in the matter, and because he cannot be expected to discharge the duty that is plainly incumbent on him, a Committee must be appointed beforehand which is to make up his mind for him, or to assist him in making up his mind in the matter.  I suggest, with all respect, that this is merely creating new opportunities for debate.  It is certainly taking away the liberty of spontaniety of criticism from individuals, because if a Committee on which Deputy Johnson and Deputy Fitzgibbon, for example, and others of whom I might name, constituted of membership of that type, were to report against a rule, and that an individual member like me should have to be guilty of the temerity of setting up his judgment against it, he would incur the odium of wasting the time of the Dail by a calling in question their report.  I suggest that the Standing Orders are much better without this incumbrance. 
    
    
      
       The Deputy has assumed that the Standing Order makes it incumbent on that Committee to make a report.  It does not.  They shall, if they consider it necessary, report.  Every member of the Dail is supposed to be conversant with every law, but, of course, we depute to specialists the responsibility of undertaking the duties which are imposed as a matter of fact on every citizen.  We are presumed to know the law.  In that sense I say it is the duty of every Deputy to understand every clause of every Bill brought before us, and also to understand the implications of every Order laid upon the Table for the information of Deputies.  But while that may be the nominal duty, we know as a matter of practice that it is outside the bounds of possibility, and, because of that, we make provision for the appointment of Special Committees to examine special Bills.  Every Deputy is supposed to have equal knowledge upon every subject.  There may be very conscientious Deputies, who would want to examine every Bill or Order that is laid upon the Table, and we know from experience that we may think we have got hold of very important defects, and we   take the opportunity of raising the question within twenty-one days before the Dail, and promote a discussion upon it, and inveigle another half-dozen Deputies to take part in the discussion.  All that may be saved if a Committee were in existence that could examine such a matter and have a right to call upon an expert from the Department concerned to explain.  I am confident that such a provision would save the time of the Dail and not waste it, and probably would facilitate legislation in matters of detail by allowing what, probably, Deputy Professor Magennis will not approve of, certain kinds of legislation to be done by Order.  I can see the possibility of this method of legislation developing in this country, just as it has developed in England during these last few years.  There are advantages in it, but only so far as these advantages are under the control of the Dail and under direct control.  I think if the responsibility for examining these Orders is thrown on every individual member indiscriminately, the check that should be applied will probably not be applied, but if a Committee has the duty thrust upon it of examining such Orders we may feel more security in allowing that kind of legislation.  That is the intention of the proposed Standing Order. 
    
    
      
       I think that the proposal either goes too far or does not go far enough because I consider that to be effective it ought to provide that all these Orders and Regulations and documents ought not to be put on the Table of the Dail but ought to be sent to the Committee; because I cannot see myself, assuming that I was on that Committee, coming here half an hour or an hour earlier every day in order to grope about the Table to see what papers had been put there since the night before Some means ought to be provided for bringing to the notice of the Committee the fact that these Orders had been made, because otherwise the Committee will come here one at a time and some of them may forget to come, and unless we make provision for this Committee to meet every day, or for the Orders to be sent direct to it, in the first instance, I do not think it will have the desired effect.  The Committee will no more go about looking for Orders that are not brought to their notice than the   ordinary member of the Dail will, and yet the Dail will tend to rely upon this Committee to bring to its notice in the proper time anything that they ought to notice.  They shirk their own duty, and they rely on the Committee, but probably, being human beings like the other Deputies, the Committee will not do anything except what is actually thrust upon it, so that the Orders will not receive even the attention they receive at present.  I am afraid it would not work. 
    
    
      
       I should explain that there is a certain amount of confusion, perhaps, in the phrase &ldquo;Papers laid on the Table.&rdquo;&ldquo;Papers laid on the Table&rdquo; means papers which have been sent to the Clerk and which in future, when we get a Library, will be sent to the Librarian and will be available for the inspection of Deputies in the Library or in the Members' Rooms.  Notice that such papers have been received is always printed on the Order Paper.  I should like to hear the point of the Minister for Local Government about the words &ldquo;available for discussion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;printed and circulated to Deputies.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I think it would be preferable to say &ldquo;printed and circulated.&rdquo; It may be that no member of the Committee may wish to propose any motion in the Dail, but if they have anything to report about one of these documents, that should be available for discussion and the way it should be made available is by having it printed as a report and circulated in the way that the Order papers are circulated, and any member may take any action he chooses. 
    
    
      
       What guarantee have we that this Committee will do more than any ordinary member?  I take it that it is within the ordinary duties of members and we are told that the ordinary member will not look at these papers and will not do what is his duty.  What guarantee have we that the Committee is going to do this? None at all.  Besides, they can initiate discussions on legislation that may never be passed.  This may be good in some directions but I think it could also be abused, and in fact I think it   will do more harm than good, and we have no guarantee whatever that the members of this Committee would do more than the ordinary member would do. 
    
    
      
       I would like to put a case.  Suppose a paper is presented to the Dail, under a statutory provision which sets forth that unless a resolution annulling this particular document is passed in the Dail before the expiration of twenty-one days, the document or order, whatever it may be, becomes law.  The Committee suggested here has that document before it, and it prints and circulates a report.  I take it that what is intended is that, in the light of the report, a Deputy will move that the Order be annulled, or will refrain from moving that the Order be annulled, but he will not be able to move something about this report if the Statute under which the Order is presented provides that some other resolution must be moved about the Order. 
    
    
      
       Quite so, and if you will allow me, I should like to supplement what you have said.  If any member of the Dail not included in that Committee wished to impeach the rule or Order, he may be held up by the answer that the Committee has investigated it and has not reported; but how is that Deputy to become aware of the date on which it will be within his power so to move, the Committee either having regarded the thing as a matter not to report on or having overlooked it altogether? It seems to me altogether a needless obligation. 
    
    
      
       The Committee could not remove the right of a Deputy to move. 
    
    
      
       No; that is quite so; but the Committee might make it undesirable for him to raise the matter until the Committee itself, under the Standing Orders, has issued a report. 
    
    
      
       Surely any Deputy would know who constituted the Committee, and such Deputy would have the ear of the Chairman of that Committee. If the Deputy who sees a flaw or an objectionable paragraph in the Order wishes to raise the matter in the Dail independently of the Committee, there is nothing   to prevent him.  If, on the other hand, he wishes to bring to the notice of the Committee such flaw or objectionable Order, the Committee is there, ready and available for him, and the Committee could either examine the point that he raised, or disabuse his mind of what is, perhaps, a fallacy.  The one argument used that may have some effect, is the leaving of the option to the Committee to report.  I would be prepared to support the suggested amendment saying that the Committee shall report within ten or fifteen days&mdash;a report in which they might say, &ldquo;We have examined it and find no objection.&rdquo;  But the only point made which seems to me to have any substance is the point that the Committee may or may not report, as it wishes. 
    
    
      
       Does Deputy Johnson not realise that what he has now proposed is, that in addition to the Cabinet, the Executive Council of the Ministry, there shall be set up another sort of Cabinet, and that other members, not constituting the Committee, are to report to this secondary Cabinet the objections that occur to them regarding certain Orders laid on the Table of the Dail; whatever fallacy is operating on the mind of the objector, that fallacy should be removed, and his mind quietened by the Committee? 
       So, in fact a great deal of what is the initiative, and not merely the privilege, but the duty of members of the Dail is by this grandmotherly system to be taken over from them, and put into the leading strings of a Committee.  If his objection is good, the Committee will bring it forward, and if objection does not find favour in the sight of the committee they will make his mind easy about it, and with this placating influence at work all will go smoothly with the Order on the Table of the Dail.  It is a most specious proposition, and seems to be giving nothing, while taking much away. 
    
    
      
       Will this Committee be bound by a majority, and will the minority have any right to raise any objection? Could not these Orders be issued every week, and sent out to each Deputy? 
    
    
      
       As I see this amendment it means that a committee   will be appointed to examine Orders, Regulations and Documents, and shall, if necessary, consider a report.  Does that mean in the event of their not reporting it shall pass&mdash;that an Order passes through automatically, and that a private member has no right to move that the Order be not complied with or adopted? In what way is the time of the Dail saved by this? 
    
    
      
       The private Member's right would certainly stand. 
    
    
      
       Then it is really a question of getting a number of Members together to see whether it is advisable, and to inform or to speak to other Members about it afterwards in an indirect way.  I do not see that that is a business proposition.  I am not concerned at all about it, but I do not think it is a benefit to us. 
    
    
      
       There have been in other Houses Committees on Estimates. We are proposing a Committee on Public Accounts.  One might say, it is the duty of every Member of the Dail to examine into the accounts and estimates, but we are relegating the specialised work of examination of accounts and estimates to a Committee, and we are asking them to report, and in the case of accounts, if they do report on them, that does not deprive the individual Member of the Dail from investigating into and reporting on any account and making any motion that he may think fit.  Nothing in this proposal will deprive any Deputy of any right he has to-day.  What it does is to throw a particular duty upon a particular group of Deputies.  Any group of Members may decide that they shall form a Committee of this kind on anything, but they will only have the rights of any group of individual Deputies.  But the proposal is, that there shall be officially appointed by the Dail a Committee that will have responsibility.  But it is not the intention, and it is not implied in the Standing Orders, that any of the present rights of any Deputy shall be in any way given up or lost.  All the rights the Deputies have will continue, but the particular duty will be thrown upon a group of Members to do certain work; and you are doing that every week, and why there   should be a particular objection in this case I cannot understand. 
    
    
      
       This proposed new Order has been amended, I take it, by the words put into the second sentence: &ldquo;every such report shall be printed and circulated to Deputies before the expiration of the time, if any.&rdquo;  I take it that that is agreed.  As a matter of order, I want to make it clear that action in the Dail, by way of a Motion, would have to be taken on the Order or on the documents, and not upon the Report of the Committee.  Nobody could move that the Dail approves of the Report of the Committee, if there was a Statutory provision that some other kind of motion could be made on the Order or on the documents. 
    
    
      
       In that case would not the report of a Committee be merely what is called a pious opinion? 
    
    
      
       With regard to the Orders and Regulations, I do not know what is meant by &ldquo;document&rdquo; here.  It may be that it means something there is not much in, or it may mean a great deal. This has come as a great surprise to me, and I do not see that there is much use in it.  I fail to appreciate all that Deputy Johnson has said.  He seems to attach considerable importance to it and to view it very favourably, and thinks it would be of some advantage.  I certainly do not see the advantage, and I do not know what is meant by &ldquo;documents.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       When we speak of documents, we mean that there are certain documents that are obligatory to be placed before the Dail and laid upon the Table, such, for instance, as the report of the Intermediate Board.  This speaks of Orders, Regulations, and Documents submitted to Dail Eireann in pursuance of any Statutes. 
    
    
      
       The argument in favour of that would not be the same as the argument in favour of Orders and Regulations, if there were Orders and Regulations which might be annulled by the Dail within a limited time.  The Committee might prevent, perhaps, unnecessary discussions due to misunderstanding on these Orders and Regulations. But in the case of other documents   I think the only effect of the Committee's report would be to cause unnecessary discussion.  In the case of ordinary documents, any one on which action must be taken within a limited time, discussions could properly be raised by any interested Deputy.  There would not be the same temptation to rush into discussion if he had only a very limited time within which to take action. 
    
    
      
       81B as amended reads:&mdash;&ldquo;A Committee shall be appointed at the beginning of every Session to examine all Orders, Regulations or Documents submitted to Dail Eireann in pursuance of any Statute, and shall, if they consider it necessary, report to Dail Eireann thereon.  Every such report shall be printed and circulated to Deputies before the expiration of the time (if any) during which such Orders, Regulations or Documents lie upon the Table.&rdquo; 
       Question put:&mdash;&ldquo;That 81B as amended stand part of the Report.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I think the Amendment is lost. 
    
    
      
       I thought the motion was that the amendment should be   passed.  I would like to divide the Dail if I am in order. 
    
    
      
       The Deputy is under a misapprehension. 
    
    
      
       I accept your ruling, A Chinn Chomhairle.  The misapprehension I was under was this: that when you said the amendment was lost I thought that meant that the new Order proposed by Deputy Fitzgibbon was carried.  The motion was: that the report be adopted which included these various schedules. 
    
    
      
       That is not so. My motion was that the report be received and considered in Committee, and then that each of these clauses should be put as in the case of a Bill in Committee except that it was not necessary to formally move each of them.  I was taking as formally moving each of them. 
    
    
      
       Perhaps the use of the word &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; by myself gave rise to some misapprehension. At any rate the motion now is: &ldquo;That the proposed new Order, 81B, as amended, stand part of the Report.&rdquo; 
       The Dail divided: Ta, 15; Nil, 23.

     Amendment declared lost. 
     
        AMENDMENT 39. 
     Order No. 82(1) to insert before this Order the following:&mdash; 
     
       Suspension of Standing Orders. 
     
     81c.  &ldquo;In cases of urgent necessity, of which the Ceann Comhairle shall be the judge, any Standing Order or Orders of Dail Eireann may be suspended for the day's sitting, on motion, duly made and seconded, without notice: Provided that such motion has the support of a majority of the whole Teachtai of Dail Eireann.&rdquo; 
     81D.  &ldquo;The suspension of any Standing Order or Orders is limited in its operation to the particular purpose for which suspension has been sought.&rdquo; 
     (2)  To alter &ldquo;54&rdquo; to &ldquo;58.&rdquo; 
    
      
       I think 81 (c) would benefit by the deletion of the word &ldquo;whole.&rdquo;  It seems absurd. &ldquo;The whole Teachtai&rdquo; is a peculiar phrase.  I would suggest that you put down &ldquo;the total number of Teachtai.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       &ldquo;Present and voting.&rdquo;  Otherwise it might mean the total number altogether. 
    
    
      
       That is what is meant. 
    
    
      
       &ldquo;Present and voting&rdquo;? 
    
    
      
       No; it means members of the Dail who have taken the oath. 
    
    
      
       The Committee understood those were the Members of the Dail. 
    
    
      
       It might be made clear. 
    
    
      
       The object of this proposal is that it should not be open for a chance majority at the commencement of a sitting to suspend the Standing Orders, and that these Standing Orders, which have been passed by all of us, should not be done away with except the majority of the whole body were in favour of suspending them for the time being. 
    
    
      
       We could say &ldquo;Members of the Dail who have taken their seats.&rdquo; 
    
     
    
      
       It is proposed to amend this Order in this way: From the word &ldquo;provided&rdquo; read &ldquo;that such motion has the support of a majority of the total number of Teachtai who have taken their seats.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Or on the roll. 
    
    
      
       The words &ldquo;who have taken their seats&rdquo; might be interpreted pretty much as a moment ago it had to be interpreted for a Deputy who was sitting outside the limits of the House.  He had to resume his seat, and that might be taken as a roundabout description of the position in deciding the question of the right to vote.  The intention is to defeat a snatch vote, and what is meant is a majority of those eligible to vote. 
    
    
      
       He is not a member until he has taken his seat? 
    
    
      
       I do not think he is, but the Minister for Local Government is anxious to have the matter cleared up. 
    
    
      
       It is set out that the oath must be taken and subscribed by every member of the Oireachtas.  That would seem to indicate that the person, when elected, is a member, although not having taken his seat. 
    
    
      
       I have decided that point in another connection. 
    
    
      
       He must take the oath before he is a member of the Dail.  The Committee never intended that it should be otherwise. 
    
    
      
       He is not eligible to vote in any division, or to take part in the transactions of the Dail until he has taken the oath.  Therefore, what is intended is: &ldquo;eligible to vote.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Will this amendment meet the case: &ldquo;Provided that such motion has the support of a majority of Teachtai who have the right to vote?&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       We have already deleted Standing Order No. 4, which provided that every Teachta should publicly sign the roll and, thereupon become entitled to sit and vote.  That has gone out. 
    
     
    
      
       Will this amendment be accepted:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that such motion has the support of a majority of Teachtai of Dail Eireann who have the right to vote?&rdquo;  Is the amendment agreed to in that form? 
    
    
      
       &ldquo;Qualified to vote&rdquo; would be better, because every Deputy has the right to vote, but he must qualify himself first. 
    
    
      
       Will this do as the amendment?&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that such motion has the support of a majority of Teachtai of Dail Eireann qualified to vote?&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       But they may not be present? 
    
    
      
       The proposed new Standing Order would read:&mdash;&ldquo;In cases of urgent necessity, of which the Ceann Comhairle shall be the judge, any Standing Order or Orders of Dail Eireann may be suspended for the day's sitting, on motion duly made and seconded without notice: Provided that such motion has the support of a majority of Teachtai of Dail Eireann qualified to vote.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I think, with all respect, that &ldquo;qualified to vote&rdquo; is too vague.  It may sound hypercritical, but let me quote an instance that will appeal at least to Deputy Fitzgibbon.  A man took a ticket for the grand stand at Doncaster races.  He offended the steward of the races.  In the issue it will be seen that this example appeals to the taste of Deputy Fitzgibbon rather than to the taste of Deputy Gorey.  This man offended one of the stewards, and he had him removed from the grounds.  He had paid a guinea for his ticket, and so he protested against his removal and brought an action.  It was held that the right to be on the lands of another man must be given by deed, and as the ticket was not an instrument signed, sealed and delivered, he had no right of action whatever. The law being interpreted in this meticulous way, the question of  compos mentis  might arise.  A man might have taken the oath in due form, signed the roll, and yet not be qualified legally.  I suggest, therefore, that the formula you submitted yourself is better&mdash;that is, the &ldquo;right to vote.&rdquo;  That precludes the   necessity for these minute enquiries as to the state of mind and health, and so on. 
    
    
      
       Is 81 (c) agreed to as amended? 
    
    
      
       I would suggest that you add, after the word &ldquo;seconded,&rdquo;&ldquo;with or,&rdquo; so that it will read &ldquo;with or without notice.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
       Amendment 39, as amended, agreed to. 
       Amendment 40 agreed to. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - DAIL RESUMES. 
    
      
       I move: &ldquo;That the Standing Orders, as amended, be reported to the Dail.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       With these additional amendments it will not be necessary to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Standing Orders, as amended, be now adopted by Dail Eireann.&rdquo;  That would make them Standing Orders from this moment. 
    
    
      
       Say as from Tuesday week.  That would give time to print and have them available for Deputies. 
    
    
      
       It is a matter for the Dail itself, whether they would agree to make a provision to have these Standing Orders operative immediately. 
    
    
      
       I would move that they be adopted at once, as I understood at the Committee that we were urged to get particularly the financial part of the Standing Orders into working order at once.  I do not press for any undue haste if the Dail considers it would be reasonable to postpone the matter for a week.  I understand, however, that we are not to sit at all next week, so that really to-morrow would be the day on which they would first take effect. 
    
    
      
       I do not know that that will be possible.  I will have to have a Supplementary Estimate to go before the Dail this week.  I do not know if that will interfere with the Standing Orders, or if the Standing Orders conflict with it. I would suggest to let them run from Tuesday week. 
    
     
    
      
       I am quite prepared to accept any suggestion.  I move: &ldquo;That the additions and amendments to the Standing Orders adopted in Committee be adopted by Dail Eireann and come into operation on and after Tuesday 20th.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I second the motion. 
       Question put:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Standing Orders adopted in Committee be adopted by Dail Eireann, and come into operation on Tuesday, March 20th.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
    
    
      
       The question of Standing Orders for Private Bills is mentioned in the introduction to this report, and I would like to inform Deputies that considerable progress has been made, and that these Standing Orders on Private Bills will be ready, in draft, next week.  The process of adopting   them will be very, very slow, as they concern a very great number of interests, all of which will have to have an opportunity of seeing them.  For example, every Government Department has to see them.  These Standing Orders come into force next Tuesday week. 
    
    
      
       Will you explain to Deputies the difference between Private Bills and Private Members' Bills? 
    
    
      
       Private Members' Bills may be either for private or public purposes, as in the case of the Hospitals Bill, which was introduced by a private member, but which concerned a public matter.  Private Bills are Bills promoted for private interests, such as a corporation, or anything like that.  When Deputies see the proposed Standing Orders for Private Bills they will appreciate that very well. 
       The Dail adjourned at 6.45 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Friday, March the 9th. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.  [  WRITTEN ANSWERS. ] - ARREST OF MR. PROUT, SOLICITOR. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether Ernest William Prout, solicitor, of 9 Leinster Street, Dublin, was arrested on Friday, March 2nd, at his residence, 69 Albert Road, Glenageary, by National Forces, and is still in custody; whether any charge has been, or is intended to be, formulated against him, and, if not, whether there is any ground for his continued detention. 
    
    
      
       Mr. Prout was arrested as stated.  He is detained pending the completion of enquiries regarding him.  In the course of a few days a charge will be formulated against him or he will be released. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.  [  WRITTEN ANSWERS. ] - DEPENDENTS' ALLOWANCE. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that no dependent's allowance has yet been paid to the mother of Thomas Charles, of Aughrim, Ballinasloe, who joined the National Army last July in Ballinasloe, and who is now (so far as his mother is aware) stationed in Bantry; whether in view of the fact that a dependent's allowance was payable to Mrs. Charles from the British Army up to June of last year, when her son was disbanded from the British Army, and that such allowance was her main source of support, he will see that her claim is immediately attended to. 
    
     
    
      
       Dependents' allowance has not yet been paid to Mrs. Charles owing to the fact that local investigation of her claim has not been completed.  The necessary enquiries are being expedited. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.  [  WRITTEN ANSWERS. ] - A PRISONER'S HEALTH. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if his attention has been directed to the case of Edward Gunning, of Sligo, a youth of 18 or 19 years, who is a prisoner in the hands of the Military Authorities; whether it is true that the doctor at Longford reported that he was suffering from tuberculosis and recommended his release; whether he was afterwards transferred to Athlone and confined with other prisoners; whether young Gunning signed the usual form of undertaking on December 11th last, and will the Minister say if, in view of his delicate health, he will now order his immediate release. 
    
    
      
       A doctor has certified that Mr. Gunning is suffering from tuberculosis, and has recommended his release.  Gunning is now detained at Custume Barracks, Athlone, to which barracks he was transferred from Longford.  There is no record of his having signed the usual form of undertaking, although he states that he did so.  However, he refuses to sign it now, and in view of this it is not intended to release him at present. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.  [  WRITTEN ANSWERS. ] - A MOYCULLEN PRISONER. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he is aware that Mortimer Reddy, of Moycullen, Co. Galway, is detained at Hare Park Camp, that Mr. Reddy has signed the usual undertaking, that he has written to his Parish Priest signifying his anxiety to be released in order to work on his father's farm, his father being close on 80 years of age, and will the Minister say why Mr. Reddy is still detained. 
    
    
      
       The prisoner, whose name is Martin Keady, was arrested and is detained in Hare Park Camp for having engaged in road cutting and having carried despatches for Irregulars.  He has signed the usual form of undertaking, but it is not intended to release him. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.  [  WRITTEN ANSWERS. ] - PORTARLINGTON PRISONER. 
     
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he can state the reason for the arrest of Daniel Flynn, Emo, Portarlington, on the 13th January, 1923, and for his continual detention in Portlaoighise Prison; if Flynn denies having any connection with the Irregular Forces; and, seeing that he is prepared to give the usual undertaking, if he will favourably consider the question of having him released at once. 
    
    
      
       Mr. Flynn's name appeared in despatches found on Irregulars who were captured, and, on being arrested, he stated that he had been a Battalion Adjutant in the Irregular Forces, but had severed his connection with them some time previously. There are, however, grounds for believing that he was still working with the Irregulars.  It is not intended to release him at present.
