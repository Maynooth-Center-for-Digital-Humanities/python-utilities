     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - SICKNESS BENEFIT FOR SOLDIERS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Finance what arrangements, if any, are made to provide that persons insured under the National Health Insurance Acts who join the Army are kept in full credit in respect of their period of service so that they will be entitled to receive sickness and disablement benefit on their discharge, and their wives to receive maternity benefit during and after their husband's Army service; and what is the position of an insured person as regards payment of sickness or disablement benefit in respect of sickness or disability arising during Army service. 
    
    
      
       The President has asked me to answer this question. A Bill in relation to National Health Insurance is about to be introduced, and the question of including provision in it in regard to the matter mentioned in the Deputy's question is being considered. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - REQUEST OF NAVAN RURAL DISTRICT COUNCIL. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government whether his attention has been called to the request of the Navan Rural District Council, made in the following terms:&mdash; 
       
         Resolved: &mdash;&ldquo;That the Local Government Department be asked to issue the balance of the loan for building the fourteen labourers' cottages remaining unbuilt under the Labourers' Order of 1911, as there is very urgent need for providing houses in the district.&rdquo; 
    
     Why this balance was not issued; and whether the Ministry for Local Government   now intends to comply with this request. 
    
      
       The resolution of the Navan Rural District Council has been brought to my notice.  The resumption of State aid for rural housing is receiving the attention of the Government.  In cases where loans had been sanctioned under the Labourers' Acts during the British Administration, but had not been fully issued, owing to the financial stringency arising out of the European War, representations have been made to the British Treasury with the object of securing that the unissued balances may be made available.  An early settlement of this question is expected, and the application of the Navan Rural District Council will then receive full consideration. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - LOANS AND GRANTS FOR FISHING INDUSTRY. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Fisheries whether it is his intention to estimate the amount of money required for loans to make the Irish fishing fleet efficient, and also what grants would be required for the immediate necessary improvements of the harbours used for fishing purposes. 
    
    
      
       I am making provision in my estimate for the granting of small supplementary loans, in approved cases, for the refitting of fishing vessels, the owners of which, owing to the period of depression through which the industry has been passing, have been unable to maintain their craft in an efficient condition. I wish it, however, to be understood that such special loans will only be granted where the applicant can satisfy the Ministry that he is prepared to make special efforts to reduce the arrears in respect of former loans.  When I state that these arrears on fishery loans total to something like Â£40,000, I think the Deputy will agree that, until we have done something to improve marketing conditions, it would not be wise to embark upon heavy expenditure in the improvement of the existing fishing fleet, or the provision of additional tonnage. 
    
     As regards fishery harbours, schemes for the improvement of certain harbours   which urgently need attention are under consideration.  It is, however, to be borne in mind that any expenditure by Government, through this Ministry, in such a case would be dependent upon the measure of financial support which the local authorities were prepared to give to any approved scheme.  I feel that there would be no object served by preparing an estimate of the total sum required for the improvement of fishery harbours, as it would run to a very large amount; and this is really not a matter that can be dealt with  in globo.  
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - POST OFFICE MESSENGERS (OLDCASTLE, CO. MEATH). 
    
      
       To ask the Postmaster-General whether changes have recently been made in the conditions of service of Post Office messengers in Oldcastle, Co. Meath; whether these messengers are now supplied with bicycles or uniforms; whether delivery of telegrams is delayed through lack of bicycles; whether only one messenger is now employed in this office whereas two were formerly employed; whether messengers on reaching the age of 16 years, if suitable, can be promoted to the permanent staff of postmen; and whether any changes of conditions in the Oldcastle office are merely local or whether similar changes have taken place elsewhere. 
    
    
      
       I find that prior to the year 1912 two regular boy messengers were employed in the delivery of telegrams at Oldcastle, but in that year the positions were abolished, and the delivery provided for by casual messengers.  In 1917 the Sub-Postmaster was granted an allowance for providing for the work, and this is the present arrangement. 
       The Sub-Postmaster states that he employs two messengers and two bicycles on the delivery, and that telegrams are not delayed through lack of bicycles. 
       The messengers being in the employment of the Sub-Postmaster are not supplied with uniform, and they are not eligible for appointment as postmen. Regular boy messengers in the service of the Department are, if qualified, provided with established appointments as postmen or in other capacities when they reach the age of 19 years. 
    
     
        Similar arrangements for telegraph delivery obtain at some other offices.  I am having renewed inquiry made in the case of Oldcastle, and if any improvement in the present delivery system at that office is warranted it will be effected. 
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - OFFALY MILITARY BARRACKS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if owing to lack of suitable accommodation for housing any large number of National troops in the town of Birr (Offaly), caused by the deliberate destruction of the military barracks there, and resulting in serious unemployment from this and other causes, he can state whether it is the intention of the Government to undertake the work of rebuilding this barracks at an early date. 
    
    
      
       I will answer this question. It is not anticipated that a decision to rebuild this barracks will be taken early. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - SOLDIERS AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce what arrangements, if any, are made to provide that persons insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts who join the Army are kept in full credit in respect of their period of service so that they will be entitled to receive unemployment allowances, if necessary, on their discharge from the Army. 
    
    
      
       The provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, in their present form, do not contemplate the maintenance of contributions for insured persons who join the Army, but I am in communication with the Minister for Defence, with a view to seeing what arrangements can be made to meet this special case.  I will inform the Deputy of the result as soon as possible. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - BIRTHDAY PARTY. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether an armed party of troops from the local barracks attended, without invitation, a birthday   party held in a labourer's cottage in Creeslough, Tirchonaill on January 14th; whether the man in charge of this party intervened, and prevented one of the guests from singing a song entitled &ldquo;Labour's Call,&rdquo; written by Peadar O Cearnaigh, author of &ldquo;A Soldier's Song&rdquo;; whether, when the party was breaking up this guest was arrested; and what action the Minister proposes to take in the matter? 
    
    
      
       Troops from Creeslough Barracks were invited to the party, and attended.  They arrested Alex.  Brown, a much-wanted Irregular, who at the time was singing &ldquo;The Red Flag.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Is the Minister for Defence quite sure it was &ldquo;The Red Flag&rdquo; he was singing? 
    
    
      
       That is my information. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - ARREST AT PORTARLINGTON. (DANIEL FLYNN). 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he can state the reason for the arrest of Daniel Flynn, Emo, Portarlington, on 13th January, 1923, and for his continued detention in Portlaoighise Prison; if Flynn denies having any connection with Irregular Forces, and seeing that he is prepared to give the usual undertaking, if he will favourably consider the question of having him released at once. 
    
    
      
       Enquiries are being made in this case, but they have not yet been completed. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - DEPENDENTS' ALLOWANCE (PATRICK BRACKEN). 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he has received repeated applications for Dependents' Allowance on behalf of Private Patrick Bracken, O'Connell Street, Tullamore, Offaly (joined 6th May, 1922); if it is correct to state that no weekly assessment has yet been made, and seeing that his widowed mother is entirely depending upon the earnings of her son now serving since last May, if he will have the matter enquired into and settled without further delay. 
    
     
    
      
       I have not received repeated applications in this case. The claim has been assessed at the rate of 7s. per week, and payments at various dates, since September last, have been made to Mrs. Mary Bracken, O'Connell Street, Tullamore. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - G.S. &amp; W.R. GOODS CHECKER (ARREST). 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he can state the reason for the arrest of Joseph O'Connor, Goods Checker, G.S. &amp; W. Railway Co., Portlaoighise Station, on 11th January, 1923; whether he is aware that O'Connor denies having been associated in any way with Irregular forces, and seeing that he is prepared to give the usual undertaking, if he will give favourable and immediate consideration to the request for his release. 
    
    
      
       Enquiries are being made in the case, but they have not yet been completed. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - SOLDIERS' DEPENDENTS' ALLOWANCE. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he has received several applications for dependents' allowance on behalf of Thomas Bartley, Pound Street, Birr, Offaly (joined at Birr Castle Barracks, 8th September, 1922), now serving in Rahan Barracks, Tullamore, Offaly, and if he will have the matter enquired into specially and settled without delay. 
    
    
      
       Two applications have been received.  The claim has been disallowed on the ground that the claimant, Private Bartley's mother, was not supported for a reasonable period prior to the enlistment of her son to the minimum extent required by regulations, namely, 12s. per week. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - CUSTODY OF SPORTING GUNS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether all sporting guns handed over to the British Authorities and stored in Island Bridge Barracks are now in possession of the   Government; further, if the more expensive guns were removed before Island Bridge Barracks was handed over to the Irish Government, and whether, prior to the introduction of the Indemnity (British Military) Bill in Dail Eireann the British Government agreed to compensate the owners of such guns. 
    
    
      
       All guns handed over to the British Authorities are not in our possession.  Arrangements were made prior to the final evacuation of the British that we would take care of such as could be identified. Others were transferred to England.  No doubt, claims for compensation by persons who voluntarily surrendered arms which cannot eventually be returned will be considered by the British Authorities. 
    
    
      
       Through what channels are the claims to be put forward? 
    
    
      
       At the present moment I am in communication with certain solicitors who desire to state claims, and I believe that these claims will be put forward through the Ministry to the British, but when the general question arises, at least when a decision has been taken with regard to the general return of these arms, a more satisfactory and expeditious method of dealing with these things will probably be arranged. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - LEIX FIRM'S ARMY ACCOUNT. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether repeated applications have been made by Mercier and Co., Durrow, Leix, for payment of an account of Â£124 14s. 9d. (including a cheque given to local O/C on 20th July, 1922, for payment of soldiers' wages), and if he can state when it is the intention of the authorities to deal with same. 
    
    
      
       Several applications have been received from Messrs. Mercier and Co., whose account is receiving attention. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - CLAIMS AGAINST THE ARMY. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he has received numerous claims against the Army authorities   arising out of the commandeering of private property for military purposes since last June, for damage to such premises and property during the period of occupation as well as for rent during such period, also for goods supplied to various sections of the National Forces by private traders in all parts of the Free State area, if he will state whether the payment of all such claims is at the discretion of the Army Council or if they are enquired into by any special Committee appointed by the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Finance, also to state whether he will urge the authorities concerned to expedite the payment of the many old outstanding claims incurred in this connection. 
    
    
      
       Many claims of the kind mentioned have been received. Those in respect of commandeered premises are now being dealt with by the Office of Public Works; those in respect of goods requisitioned by a Departmental Committee appointed by me; and an Inter-departmental Committee is considering claims in respect of motor cars. 
       Everything is now being done to expedite the payment of these outstanding claims. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - SHANNON BRIDGE ROBBERIES. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he is aware that two armed men demanded admission to the Hotel, Shannon Bridge, Offaly, at 2.55 a.m. on 24th December, 1922, stating that they were members of the National Army, and having been allowed inside under threats, held up the proprietor and robbed the premises of Â£83 in cash, and goods valued at Â£100; whether National troops (who are stationed in the street about 50 yards from hotel door) were actually outside for a period of 45 minutes, if a military enquiry has been demanded and held, and if so, with what result; whether he is aware that numerous robberies have taken place in this area during the past two months, and seeing that the National Army now serving in this area (nearly all local men) have failed to take any effective measures to trace or deal with the culprits, if he will state what steps he proposes to take for the protection of the innocent and inoffensive section of citizens in the area. 
    
     
    
      
       It appears that two armed Irregulars demanded admission to the Hotel, Shannon Bridge, at the time and on the date mentioned, and that they took goods to the value of Â£103 and Â£82 in cash.  A sworn inquiry into this matter has been held, but full particulars are not yet available. 
       There is a post of 18 troops&mdash;none of whom are local men&mdash;stationed in Shannon Bridge, about 130 yards from the hotel door.  There were no National troops outside the hotel during the raid. 
       Numerous robberies by Irregulars have taken place in the district, but all steps possible under the present circumstances are taken to safeguard the interests of the civilian population of the district. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - OCCUPATION OF DURROW CASTLE. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he is aware that Durrow Castle, Durrow, Leix, was commandeered and occupied by National troops from May until August, 1922, and that during the period of occupation considerable damage was caused to valuable furniture (which it had been arranged to dispose of by public auction), and other property, resulting in a considerable loss to the owners (Maher Bros.); whether the military evacuated the premises without handing over possession, and have refused to accede to the request of the owners to send down a representative to take an inventory of the damage and missing articles, if he can arrange to have the request of the owners carried out without delay, thereby enabling them to dispose of their property and save any further and unnecessary liabilities against the State. 
    
    
      
       The premises were occupied by troops about the period mentioned, but no definite information is available as to the extent of the damage caused by the occupation.  A request was received on behalf of the owners that an inventory of the damage to furniture and fittings should be taken, but it was not possible to accede to that request until definite arrangements had been made for dealing with claims of the kind.  It has now been arranged that the Office of Public Works shall be responsible for payment of rent in respect of   Army premises, and of compensation for damage caused by troops during the occupation, and particulars of this claim are being forwarded to be dealt with by that Department. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - ARMY PAYMENTS IN TULLAMORE. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he is aware that the officer commanding the National troops at Tullamore, Offaly, has been supplied with goods amounting to the value of Â£507 11s. 10d. by Mr. G.N. Walsh during the period July to December, 1922; whether it is correct to state that repeated applications have been made both to Tullamore and to G.H.Q., Portobello Barracks, for whole or part payment of this amount, and in view of the hardship imposed on traders by withholding payment of such old outstanding accounts, if he will urge the responsible authorities to expedite payment of this account. 
    
    
      
       An account has been received by the military authorities at Tullamore.  Its consideration will be expedited.  It does not appear that any application in the matter was received at G.H.Q. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - BUILDING SUBSIDY. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government if he has considered the desirability of granting to private builders a sum sufficient to make the building of houses a paying proposition; if so, will he state the amounts, and if they will be provided for in the 1923-24 Estimates. 
    
    
      
       The question of reviving grants to private builders is at present under consideration in connection with the housing policy of the Government for the coming year.  Legislation will be necessary to give effect to any proposals evolved, so that I am not now in a position to state the probable amount of grants or the total sum which may have to be provided for in the Estimates for 1923-24. 
    
    
      
       May I ask the Minister will he give those builders proceeding now with the erection of houses the benefits of the new legislation. 
    
     
    
      
       I could not give any answer that would anticipate the decision of the Dail in regard to future legislation. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - CONDITION OF IRISH FISHING INDUSTRY. 
     The following stood in the name of Mr. Darrell Figgis: To ask the Minister for Fisheries if he is aware that the Irish fishing industry is at the present moment in a perilous state; if one of the contributory causes to this is that the railway freights for fish are very high; if, in most countries that have a fishing industry to nurture and cultivate, special freights and facilities are arranged for the cheap and rapid transit of fish; and if he will undertake to call a Conference representative of the industry and of Railway Boards to inquire into the possibility of such similar action being taken in Ireland. 
    
      
       I beg to ask the question standing in the name of Deputy Darrell Figgis. 
    
    
      
       Has the Deputy permission in writing from the Deputy in whose name the question stands to ask it in accordance with the Standing Orders? 
    
    
      
       I take it that the Deputy has the authority of Deputy Darrell Figgis. 
    
    
      
       I have the authority by telegram.  I think, however, it is a matter for the Minister. 
    
    
      
       It is a matter for Standing Orders. 
    
    
      
       It is a question of Standing Orders. 
    
    
      
       I am aware that the fishing industry is in a bad state, and that one of the contributory causes is that the railway charges for transit of fish are very high.  The average increase on freights over Irish lines above the pre-war rates is about 50 per cent. for fresh fish, and 150 per cent. for cured fish, while the present through rates to Cross-Channel stations represent an average increase of about 62 per cent. on the pre-war figures.  It is the case that in some other countries special facilities   for the rapid transit of fish are provided, and I believe I can arrange for a Conference on the subject as suggested by the Deputy.  I may say that within the past twelve months two meetings have taken place between railway representatives and officials concerned with fishery administration, and as a result certain reductions in rates have been secured.  It is obvious, however, that the present is hardly a favourable time to demand an increase in transit facilities from the companies.  The maintenance of the normal service is as much as we can hope for at present. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - BALLYCONNELL RAID. 
    
      
       I wish to ask whether now, or at any other time, such as on the adjournment, the Ministry will be able to give the Dail any further information upon the appalling occurrence at Ballyconnell yesterday.  I need not go into the details.  All who read the morning Press are cognisant of what occurred, and know that it was so startling and so astounding that, I think, if there is any further information bearing upon this shocking occurrence, where two civilians were murdered by Irregulars, and where the life of another was seriously endangered, I think it is important it should be given to the Dail at once.  Questions have been raised in connection with the deaths of other people, and I think the safety of the civilian population is as much a matter of public interest as is the question of the lives of people taken in arms against the Government. 
    
    
      
       I think if the Deputy raises the matter on the adjournment it will be the most suitable thing to do. 
    
   
   
     THE STATUTORY UNDERTAKINGS (CONTINUATION OF CHARGES) BILL, 1923.&mdash;FIRST STAGE. 
    
      
       I beg to ask leave of the Dail to introduce this Bill, to have it printed, and read the first time.  It is &ldquo;a Bill to authorise certain Statutory Undertakings in Saorstat Eireann, to continue temporarily the increases authorised under recent Statutes in the Statutory Charges made   by such undertakings respectively, and for other purposes connected therewith.&rdquo; 
       The Bill applies to Tramways, Harbours, Docks and Port undertakings, and also Canals and Inland Navigation.  It was found, after the European War, that the maximum charges these undertakings were authorised to make were not sufficient to carry on, owing to the high cost of material and labour, and, accordingly, Acts were passed in the British Parliament that enabled the then British Ministry of Transport to authorise temporary increases in the charges then made.  The Orders made at that time by the Ministry of Transport will expire on the 15th of this month, and, having regard to the present conditions, it is proposed by this Bill to enable them to carry on as at present.  It may properly be described as a purely emergency measure to get over the next twelve months. 
    
    
      
       I beg to second the motion. 
       Question: &ldquo;That leave be given to bring in the Bill.&rdquo; 
       Put and agreed to. 
       Order for Second Reading, Friday, February 9th. 
    
   
   
     ENFORCEMENT OF LAW (OCCASIONAL POWERS) BILL, 1923.&mdash;REPORT STAGE. 
    
      
       I beg to move that the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Bill be received for final consideration. 
    
    
      
       I beg to second the motion. 
       The following amendments appeared in the Order paper in the name of Mr. Gavan Duffy:&mdash; 
       (1)  To add to Section 7, Sub-section 1, line 22:&mdash; 
    
     &ldquo;Provided that no chattels shall be removed by, or by order of, an Under-Sheriff to any place outside Ireland without the leave of a District Justice, such leave to be obtainable upon application made  ex parte  by the person at whose instance the Under-Sheriff enforces execution, and upon such evidence   as the District Justice shall deem sufficient.&rdquo; 
     (2)  In Sub-section 2, lines 26 and 27, to insert between the words &ldquo;within or&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;outside&rdquo; the words &ldquo;subject as aforesaid.&rdquo; 
     (3)  In Sub-section 4 line 55, to insert between the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;be&rdquo; the words &ldquo;(subject as aforesaid).&rdquo; 
     
     
    
      
       I beg to move the first amendment.  The first three amendments on the Order paper stand or fall together, the second and third being consequential on the first.  The object of the first amendment is to impose some check upon the liability of abuse by the Sheriff of the new power he is acquiring, of taking the goods in execution for sale beyond the seas. Upon the last reading I tried to induce the Minister to leave out of the Bill the power to remove goods to England or elsewhere.  He gave his reasons for refusing, and I am free to admit that in the case of certain classes of chattels these reasons would be cogent ones under certain circumstances.  That does not, however, alter the fact that by putting an indiscriminate, unchecked power into the hands of the Sheriff to remove goods out of Ireland you are liable to inflict very great hardship on the debtor, I was trying to find the simplest way of getting some sort of control or check, and the method here proposed is an attempt to put down in writing what seems to be to be the simplest way, while I am willing to agree to any other method, so long as there is a check.  The object of this amendment is to prevent an execution creditor from sending goods outside of Ireland, cattle or other chattels, without first going to the local Justice and explaining to him the circumstances under which he thinks that this unusual step is necessary.  The proposal is that the creditor should do this in the simplest possible way by going, without any legal formalities or notice to the other side, to the Justice, and stating his case and satisfying the Justice that he could not get a proper sale of the goods in question in Ireland.  One could easily conceive the possibility of valuable goods being taken away on the ground that a better sale could be got elsewhere, and all this being done in haste and without   proper consideration.  I desire to see some check imposed on arbitrary power which may become a danger. 
    
    
      
       It is not proposed to accept this amendment. 
    
    
      
       The amendment must be seconded. 
    
    
      
       I formally second it. 
    
    
      
       I do not think that if the amendment were accepted it would appreciably improve the position. An Under-Sheriff is the officer not of the District Justice's Court, but of the Higher Court, and to say that he, with his full knowledge of the circumstances and the discretion which he must be assumed to possess, by reason of his qualifications for the office, being an officer of a Higher Court, must go before a District Justice and show cause why he should take certain action, I do not think is a good proposal.  It is not in keeping with the dignity of the Higher Court to send an officer to explain or defend his action before a Lower Court. 
    
    
      
       If the Minister would pardon me, I think he misunderstands the proposal.  It is not proposed that the Under-Sheriff should go before the Justice, but it is proposed that the creditor should go to the Justice or whoever is the permanent legal official there. 
    
    
      
       I do not think that the amendment is useful or necessary. We must assume certain discretion and certain probity on the part of the officers of our Administration, for if we do not, and if we are to simply set to work to legislate on the basis that these officers must be assumed to be either rogues or tyrants, then we would find our programme of legislation very crowded indeed.  Why will an Under-Sheriff attempt to take goods out of the country if he can get a reasonable sale within the country?  People do not go to these rounds or to that trouble, and if the answer is that he would do it for the purposes of fraud, then why not let him be prosecuted?  There is always a remedy against fraud or malicious action of this kind.  This amendment is not a practical one, and I do not recommend it to the Dail. 
    
     
        Amendment put and negatived. 
    
      
       Amendments 2 and 3 are lost consequentially. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move the fourth amendment, which is as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;To add in line 24, after the words &lsquo;breaking in&rsquo;:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;Provided always that before breaking into any dwelling house or other building the Under-Sheriff shall have made reasonable efforts to enter peaceably and without violence.&rdquo; 
       This is an amendment to which I attach considerable importance, because on the last reading this Dail gave the Sheriff&mdash;I think very wrongly&mdash;power to break into any dwelling house, be it that of a debtor or that of a third party, and gave him a complete indemnity for doing so.  I do not think that it is unreasonable to suggest that we must have in this Bill a clause insisting that before the Sheriff can break into anybody's house, be it debtor or third party, he must, like every other person, take the ordinary steps of knocking at the door and of ringing the bell.  I may be told that it is unnecessary, but we are living in strange times, and I should not like to give the Under-Sheriff the extraordinary power of going to a man's house and breaking in without further ado.  I press this amendment on the Dail as being essential to prevent the risk of serious trouble in cases where you may have, not necessarily a bad Under-Sheriff, but an unsatisfactory substitute bailiff.  It is not the Under-Sheriff himself, but these bailiffs, these new gentlemen who are to be the substitutes for the hitherto qualified bailiffs, who can be sent to such and such a house, and these inexperienced gentlemen in certain cases may be tempted, and certainly are liable to take the law literally as they find it and break into the house.  I want to stop that. 
    
    
      
       I second that amendment.  I think it is not unfair that the Sheriff's officer should be asked to demand admission. 
    
    
      
       It will be convenient if in dealing with this amendment I can refer to the subsequent   amendment standing in the name of Deputy Fitzgibbon.  They both aim pretty much at the same objective, and the only fault that I have to find with Deputy Fitzgibbon's amendment is that it is so worded that it seems almost to invite actions against the Under-Sheriff. My suggestion would be to combine the object of that amendment with the object of the amendment of Deputy Gavan Duffy.  I would suggest this amendment in these or in similar terms:&mdash;&ldquo;To add at the end of Section 10: &lsquo;Provided, however, that (a) in any case where the Under-Sheriff shall break and enter the premises of a person other than the person against whom he has been called upon to enforce a judgment order or decree, he shall either have found any goods, animals, or other chattels of such last mentioned person therein or thereon or shall have reasonable grounds for believing that there were some such goods, animals, or chattels therein or thereon, and also (b) in every case he shall have made reasonable efforts to enter peacefully and without violence.&rdquo; If both the Deputies would consent to that interpretation of their wishes and accept that amendment as sufficiently embodying what they wish to secure, possibly the Dail would allow that to be accepted. 
    
    
      
       Would the Minister let me see that amendment in writing? 
    
    
      
       Certainly. 
    
    
      
       These two amendments deal with wholly different matters.  The amendment of Deputy Gavan Duffy, which is before the Dail, aims at providing that the Sheriff's officer shall knock at the door of any man's house before he breaks it down. My amendment, which is not yet before the Dail, only deals with breaking into the house of anyone who is not the judgment debtor.  When I come to it, I think I can show a reason why the suggestion made by the Minister for Home Affairs would not be satisfactory. 
    
    
      
       So far as my amendment goes I think the text proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs is an acceptance of it; therefore we might vote; presumably there is no objection to it. 
    
     
    
      
       Deputy Gavan Duffy's amendment is withdrawn, so. 
    
    
      
       No, it is accepted. 
    
    
      
       These are very irregular proceedings. 
    
    
      
       My point is that the Minister in effect accepts my amendment.  I may not be right, but I think he does. 
    
    
      
       The Minister does not accept the amendment. He rose and spoke against it, and suggested a different amendment.  Before the Dail can decide if that different amendment should be accepted, or put, we shall have to have this amendment withdrawn. 
    
    
      
       I think there is a misapprehension.  The Minister spoke on two amendments, which he combined. 
    
    
      
       One of which was not moved. 
    
    
      
       At the end of the new amendment he dealt with mine in a form of words, which are a reproduction of mine.  That form of words would not be applicable unless the two are joined together.  Therefore I suggest that my amendment be taken. 
    
    
      
       They cannot be combined. 
    
    
      
       I accept Amendment No. 4. 
       Amendment put and agreed. 
    
    
      
       I move the following Amendment: At the end of Clause 10, to add:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided nevertheless that any Under-Sheriff who shall break and enter the premises of any person other than the person against whom he is called upon to enforce a judgment order or decree, and shall fail to find any goods, animals, or other chattels of the debtor thereon shall, notwithstanding any provision of this Act, be liable to an action for such breaking and entry, and for any injury occasioned thereby or in consequence thereof, unless he shall satisfy the Court or jury before whom such action shall be tried, that he had reasonable   grounds for believing that there were goods, animals, or other chattels of the debtor upon the said premises.&rdquo; I had no intention when drafting this amendment of inviting or provoking actions against the Sub-Sheriffs or their officers. I think that the criticism is not unfair until you read the clause itself, and when you do so it appears to me that the wording of it makes the amendment in the form I have drafted it necessary, and prevents the suggestion of the Minister from having any effect at all, except the clause beginning &ldquo;that no action for damages or trespass shall lie against the Under-Sheriff.&rdquo; You start by taking away any right of action whatever, and the suggestion of the Minister does not give back the right of action that is taken away in the first clause.  It is necessary to provide that in certain events he should get that right back.  The suggestion of the Minister gave him back no right at all.  It was simply a provison, but it did not give the right back.  I do not think, in view of the wording of the clause, that the amendment can be read as inviting actions against the Sub-Sheriff.  You started by taking that right away.  The proviso is that if he breaks into the premises of a person other than the judgment debtor he shall be liable to an action, unless he proves that he had reasonable grounds for doing it.  It was stated by a well-known Sub-Sheriff so long ago now that he may not be very well known to all the members of this Dail, because I am afraid I am amongst the very highest class in ranks of age here, that Sheriffs' bailiffs were not recruited from the ranks of the Archangels.  I make no charge against Sheriffs' bailiffs as a class or as individuals, but we all know that from the earliest times Sheriffs' bailiffs have been held up in literature and elsewhere as people who are not overflowing with the milk of human kindness.  The trade they follow makes it essential that they should be hard men, because they have to deal with every kind of fraudulent debtor, and the people with whom they have to deal are in the main people evading the payment of just debts, who have to be compelled in some way or other.  Of course, there are cases of hardship. The Sheriffs' bailiffs are up against a very hard lot, and it is not to be wondered that they are a very hard lot themselves. I desire to provide against any   possibility of the Sheriffs' bailiffs, not through their own inherent vice, but through the nature of circumstances, and particularly to the possibility of their being used, without fault of their own, to satisfy private spite to the detriment of unfortunate people who are wholly innocent. Now, there would be nothing easier for a person who had a grudge against a next door neighbour when he saw the bailiff levelling distress in the street, than to say &ldquo;You will find goods in such and such a place,&rdquo; and off he goes, and the Sheriff's bailiffs break in the door on that information, maliciously given by that person, and that person whose door was broken in is left without any remedy whatsoever, although there may never have been any goods on his premises. Now, I think it ought to be up to the Sheriff's bailiff, when he breaks into a person's premises and finds nothing there, if the person whose premises were broken in chooses to have a shot at him, that he should be in a position to satisfy the Court, or whoever he goes before, that he had reasonable grounds for believing he would find something on the premises.  I do not think that is an invitation to bring bogus actions.  If such actions are brought, and if those who bring them are beaten, the costs will have to be paid any way.  People will not bring actions and run the risk of being involved in costs.  I do not think it is unfair to say that a man who has reasonable ground for action against a Sheriff should be precluded from bringing it.  And unless you put in a proviso such as I have here the first lines of the section take away that right of action, and nothing gives it back.  I do press you not to reject this amendment, and if the Ministry do not accept it, though I do not like going to divisions, I will ask this Dail to say that this is not an unfair protection to give to an innocent man, because remember he must be innocent if the Sheriff finds no goods in his place.  It is only in the case of breaking and entering in which nothing is found, and the Sheriff is unable to give reasonable grounds for breaking and entering, that any action can succeed.  I know there is a party in this Dail who think that this section is so water-tight that it cannot be amended at all, but surely if any amendment can be produced to mitigate the   hardships of which they complain they ought not to vote against it, and I think any person here who contemplates the possibility of a Sheriff coming down and breaking into his premises for the purpose of levying a distress for a debt due by somebody else ought to support this amendment. 
    
    
      
       I second the amendment. 
    
    
      
       The section, no doubt, takes away a right.  The amendment which I suggested provides an exception to that it provides that in certain circumstances the right shall not be taken away.  Whether it is better to take away a right and then proceed by an amendment definitely to give it back, or, taking away a right, to proceed to say that in certain definite circumstances that provision shall not have effect, is, of course, an abstruse question which we need not delay on.  My suggestion was to add to Section 10 an amendment in these terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided, however, that in any case where the Under-Sheriff shall break and enter the premises of a person other than a person against whom he has been called upon to enforce a judgement order or decree, he shall either have found any goods, animals, or such other chattels of such last mentioned person therein or thereon, or shall have had reasonable grounds for believing that there were some such goods, animals, or chattels therein or thereon.&rdquo; 
    
     In other words, that the provisions of Section 10 should not apply unless there was a fulfilment of the terms set out in that amendment.  I do think that that is a better angle to approach the matter from than the angle set out in the Deputy's amendment.  It is necessary that even the most timid Under-Sheriff should not be deterred from the performance of his duty, or the performance of his full duty.  To the timid man the language of the Deputy's amendment is menacing.  It is simply a matter of the effect on his mind of the two.  I submit that an Under-Sheriff who simply sees set out a positive statement that he shall be liable to an action might be very much impressed, but if he sees it is set in a negative way, that no action shall lie provided that so and so&mdash;in other   words, that there is good faith on his part, reasonable grounds for believing that the goods of the judgment debtor are in fact in those premises, that is something he understands, something that will not have the same menacing or terrifying effect on his mind.  I do not feel impelled by my light of reason to accept the Deputy's amendment.  I much prefer my own suggestion. 
    
      
       Would the Minister read again the words which give a cause of action, because I could not catch them. 
    
    
      
       The effect of the amendment which I suggest is to provide an exception to Section 10.  It would simply be a continuance of Section 10. It is a proviso to Section 10.  (Minister's Amendment again read.) 
       In other words, Section 10 shall not have effect unless these conditions are fulfilled. 
    
    
      
       Shall I be in order in saying one more word to try to get this thing elucidated?  What Deputy Fitzgibbon pointed out is right.  There is no cause of action in the words just read by the Minister, and, even if there were, there is still this substantial difference between the two amendments, that Deputy Fitzgibbon puts upon the Sheriff, who alone knows what is in his mind, the proof of whether he had reasonable cause or not, whereas the Minister puts it upon the debtor, who cannot know what is in the Sheriff's mind&mdash;to prove positively whether the Sheriff had reasonable cause or not.  Obviously the reasonable thing is to make the Sheriff prove whether he had reasonable grounds or not. 
    
    
      
       The effect of my amendment is to qualify Article 10&mdash;to say that this positive, universal statement that no action shall lie is modified and qualified to this extent, that he must either have found some goods, animals or chattels on the premises, or he must have reasonable grounds for his belief that they were there. 
    
    
      
       With all respect to the Minister, there is no cause of action provided. 
    
    
      
       The Deputy cannot speak again except we recommit these Clauses. 
    
     
    
      
       The Minister is misinterpreting his own amendment. 
    
    
      
       Is not the effect of the Minister's amendment, that if the Under-Sheriff does not find those goods, animals or chattels on the premises, and is not able to show that there were reasonable grounds to believe they were there, a cause of action does lie. 
    
    
      
       What I cannot understand about the matter is, that any Government should claim the right to take away a freeman's right.  What right has an Under-Sheriff to break into my house, good, bad or indifferent, when he is on another duty.  Are we to be free men or are we not?  That is really what it amounts to. 
    
    
      
       It seems to me that there is very little difference. 
    
    
      
       A Deputy cannot speak a second time except we recommit this Bill. 
    
    
      
       I forgot we were not in Committee. 
    
    
      
       Is it in order for any Deputy to move the re-committal of the Bill? 
    
    
      
       It is. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move it. 
    
    
      
       I second that. 
       Motion put: &ldquo;That Section 10 and Section 15 of the Bill be re-committed.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. 
    
      
       If the Minister now moves Section 10, we can have a discussion on it. 
    
    
      
       I move Section 10. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move the amendment I have already moved to Section 10.  I am not going to waste time by repeating what I have already said about it.  The interpretation of this Section seems to me to be a question of law.  To the best of my opinion, it would be interpreted in any Court in the way I have said.  I cannot guarantee what any judge might or might not say about it, but I put down this amendment and I pressed it because I believed the   amendment of the Minister would not carry out the intention I had. 
    
    
      
       The existing law, I take it, allows for an action.  The effect of Section 10 is to remove that right, and the effect of the addition I propose to make is to qualify the removal of that right&mdash;to say that that right is removed, provided that the Under-Sheriff when he breaks and enters does, in fact, find goods or chattels of the judgment debtor there, or in the alternative that he can show reasonable grounds for believing that there were some such goods, animals, or chattels therein.  No doubt there must be a difficulty.  The Deputy is eminent in his profession, but I cannot see the difficulty. 
    
    
      
       I am not a factious opponent of the Government. 
    
    
      
       I never made any such monstrous suggestion, sir. 
    
    
      
       I am quite honest&mdash;about this.  (Laughter.) 
    
    
      
       As I understand the matter, you have the existing law under which an action would lie against the Under-Sheriff; you have then this Section which removes it, and if you add my amendment you will find that it only removes that right of action when certain conditions are not fulfilled, and these are the conditions set out in my proposed amendment. 
    
    
      
       My only reason for rising again is that I seconded the motion for recommittal, because I am satisfied that the Minister and the Dail generally were under a misapprehension as to where the difficulty lay. Deputy Fitzgibbon asked the Minister to point to the words in his amendment which gave back in certain circumstances the right taken away by the Bill.  The Minister read the words of his amendment, and I listened to them very carefully. I could find no words in his amendment giving back anything whatsoever. His amendment provides for certain cases.  He does not say what is going to happen when those cases arise.  He does not say that when the Under-Sheriff acts without reasonable ground an action shall lie.  If the Minister's amendment were accepted we would be in no better position than we   would have been in if it had not been introduced.  The amendment introduced from the Ministerial bench, in fact, although it sounds very nice, gives us nothing. 
    
    
      
       re-read his amendment, and added &ldquo;No action shall lie provided there is good faith.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I may be very dense, but I still fail to see the words giving back the right of action. 
    
     
    
      
       It is not a question of giving back the cause of action; it is a question of qualifying and limiting the removal of the cause of action. 
    
    
      
       The difference seems to be, to a plain individual like me, between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. I am prepared to support Deputy Fitzgibbon because he says there is some legal difficulty in the case.  I must say that I do not see it, and I do not think anybody else sees it.

     Amendment declared lost. 
    
      
       If the Dail would allow me, I would move an addition which, in my opinion, meets the point, but meets it in a different way.  To say an action shall lie in this is one thing; that no action shall lie provided that, is another thing.  The same point is met, but I prefer the negative way of putting it, by saying that an action would not lie provided certain conditions were fulfilled. If the Dail is willing to accept it I would now move this amendment (to add after Section 10):&mdash; 
       &ldquo;Provided, however, that in any case where the Under-Sheriff shall break and enter the premises of a person other than a person against whom he has been called upon to enforce a judgment order or decree, he shall either have found any goods, animals, or other chattels of such last mentioned person therein or thereon, or shall have had reasonable grounds for believing that there were some such goods, animals, or chattels therein or thereon.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Do I take it that permission is given to move this amendment? 
       Agreed. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
       Question: &ldquo;That Section 10, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
       Put and agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I take it that that includes Amendment No. 4? 
    
     
    
      
       Yes. 
    
    
      
       I move Section 15:&mdash;&ldquo;(1) This Act may be cited as the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Act, 1923. 
       &ldquo;(2)  This Act shall come into force immediately on the passing thereof, and shall continue in force for six months thereafter, and shall then expire.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       My amendment is to insert a new Section before Section 15.  It has nothing to do with Section 14 or 15.  It is simply the introduction of new matter into the Bill.  It is to enable a County Court Judge before whom an action is tried, where he is satisfied that a defendant is honestly unable to pay the full amount of his debts without any default on his own part, to put a stay on the execution, either upon the decree or upon the levying of the amount of the decree.  It was agreed on all sides, both on the Second Reading and in the Committee Stage, that it gave Sheriff officers very new and terrible powers, and particularly that of levying immediate execution after a decree.  Now it seems not unreasonable that where some unfortunate judgment debtor against whom a decree is passed is unable to satisfy judgment by immediate payment, and his inability is due to no act or fault of his own, that some stay might be placed by a judicial authority on judicial grounds against the immediate execution of that decree.  At the present time, whether through oversight or not I do not know, the County Court Judge has no power to give a stay of execution on his decree, with the one exception of an ejectment order for non-payment of rent. High Court Judges have that power. There the County Court Judge has, under an Act passed in 1887, power to give a stay, and enable a tenant to pay his rent by instalments if he thinks fit, and prevent him being put out of his holding  In no other case can the County Court Judge put on any stay. They have been avoiding that in some cases, but not always by what is contrary to Magna Charta by delaying justice, and the County Court Judge who thinks it might not be proper to grant an immediate execution takes the drastic and, I venture to suggest, illegal course of refusal to hear a case at all, and of throwing it over to the next sessions.   That may be attaining the ends of justice&mdash;but it brings justice into contempt when you have to attain its ends by illegality, and it is not conducive to respect for judicial tribunals when you have to try and find an excuse for injustice by another injustice, and by refusing to hear a litigant who comes before you. Now, another case in which it operates unfairly is this: two people may have claims against some man.  One goes into the High Courts and gets a decree with a stay of execution.  The other goes into the County Court, but the County Court Judge adjourns the case to the next Sessions.  It is not tried, because if the Judge had tried it he could not give a stay of execution.  Now, suppose the debtor becomes bankrupt, one man has a perfectly good decree, but the other has not, and the principle in bankruptcy is that as decrees are given they rank, and therefore one man who has obtained his decree will be able to get judgment over the other man, who took the more suitable and more economic course of going through the County Court.  It does not seem unreasonable that County Court Judges should have the same power as High Court Judges in granting a stay of execution, and I think it is quite reasonable that they should have power to grant an order for payment by instalments.  That is a power they do not possess, but is a power that is possessed by the High Court.  I have framed this clause not entirely out of my own head, nor is it my own invention.  I went to the Act of Parliament which already gives power to stay executions&mdash;that is, the Land Act, which deals with cases of ejectments&mdash;and I have modified the provisions so as to deal with any case that may arise.  The clause has three divisions: 
    
     (1)  Upon the hearing of any civil bill for debt or damages, if the County Court Judge before whom the proceedings are pending is satisfied that the defendant is unable to satisfy by an immediate payment in full the judgement and costs, and that such inability does not arise from his own conduct, act, or default, and that there is reasonable ground for granting an extension of time to pay, the County Court Judge may put a stay upon the execution of the judgment or decree of the Court, or upon the execution of the writ of  fieri facias  for such time as the County Court Judge   thinks reasonable, and the County Court Judge may, if he thinks fit, order that the amount of such judgment or decree and the costs shall be paid by such instalments as the County Court Judge may appoint. 
     (2)  If the County Court Judge is of opinion that the defendant can pay the first of such instalments forthwith, he shall so order.  If default is made in complying with the order of the Court for the payment of the first or any subsequent instalment, the stay upon the execution of the judgment or decree, or upon the execution of the writ of  fieri facias , shall be removed, and it may thereupon be executed forthwith. 
     (3)  This section shall not apply to any judgment or decree given or pronounced before the passing of this Act. 
     (4)  In this section the expression &ldquo;County Court Judge&rdquo; includes a Recorder and the Judge of a borough. 
     Sub-Clause (3) provides against going back and raking up decrees that have been given some years ago.  I understand the Government do not desire that this legislation should be retrospective. I have an objection myself to retrospective legislation, which is generally unfair, and which, I think, ought only to be resorted to in extreme cases.  I do not think this is an extreme case, and I do not think that where decrees are already given it would be reasonable, after a period, to come into Court and secure a stay in order to have an instalment order made.  The last part of the section provides that the County Court Judge should include a Recorder. 
    
      
       I accept that amendment. 
    
    
      
       I only wish to express my regret that sub-section 3 is in this amendment.  From what the Deputy has told us it is clear that County Court Judges have been unable, even when they wished, to prevent the granting of judgments to people who might execute them at once.  There might be cases of injustice in the past few years where the judge would have been very glad to stay execution if he could, but the Deputy has told us that he could not do it.  I fail to see why, now that you   are making discrimination, you should not extend the benefit of the right to claim the stay of execution to the man against whom judgment was given before this Act came into force.  In the case of higher court judgments there was no question of the judge's right but in the case of County Court judgments the Judge himself could not prevent the creditors from executing.  Surely that is not fair.  Why not put the two things on a level now?  If it is right to do it now in respect of future judgments, it it is right to do it for past judgments where a judge could not help himself and stay execution.  I am against this sub-section and hope that the Deputy will not insist upon it. 
    
    
      
       I was afraid of coming into conflict with you, a Chinn Chomhairle, if I put it otherwise, because I rather thought we had an amendment proposed by Deputy Gavan Duffy in the Committee stage to have these decrees re-opened and I thought that you might drop on me if I tried to move the kind of amendment already rejected. 
    
    
      
       If that particular sub-section comes out the amendment will not be accepted. 
    
    
      
       I think that if Deputy Fitzgibbon had not added sub-section 3 it would not appear that he was definitely in favour of its insertion.  I am astonished and gratified at hearing the Minister accept this amendment because I gathered from the earlier stages of the discussion that this was not a Bill to interfere with or enlarge the powers of the Court.  It had to do with the execution of the decrees of the Courts, and I want to suggest that it would have been very much wiser if the object sought for had been obtained by legislation enlarging the powers of the Courts and giving them this privilege to make discrimination between the classes of cases than to give special powers to a special executive authority which would enforce the decrees of these Courts in these special cases.  The effect of paragraph 3 is going to limit very greatly the value of the new section. Since we met last I have received a communication indicating very clearly the kind of case which I fear may   arise very frequently and, given the right or wrong kind as the case may be of a sub-sheriff, the effect of such cases would be very bad indeed.  There are four small traders in a town in Co. Longford. Their premises were looted and their business destroyed by Crown forces in November, 1920.  Their claims were heard but they have received no money. Decrees were granted but they have no money and no recompense of any kind has yet been paid.  Against one of these four traders there are three writs and one civil bill served on him for goods, the greater portion of which were looted by 29 Black and Tans in November, 1920. To show the particular kind of man, and his desire to meet the legitimate claims, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;I sold a field in May for Â£200, and divided it among my creditors. Judgement marked for so and so and costs in the Sheriff's hands at present.&rdquo; He wants to know if it would be possible to stay proceedings against him, and men like him, until their compensation claims are paid, when they would be glad to pay what they owe.  In this case there is compensation coming to them some day.  We are now telling the Sub-Sheriffs to go ahead and execute the decrees by any means they wish, and dispose of the proceeds in any manner they choose.  If this section had been inserted without Sub-section 3 it might be possible for these men to go to the courts and ask for some kind of a review of their case and for a stay of execution, but now they are in danger of a decree being enforced, their goods being sold and the men being driven into bankruptcy, and there is nothing to prevent it as things are at present.  That is just an illustration regarding traders.  I have reason to believe that there is a very large number of farmers in the country entirely unaffected by the stress and strife, who are in a somewhat similar position because of certain circumstances economical, political and military, but we are going to leave them at the mercy of creditors who, enabled in this case to use the instruments set up with greatly increased powers are going to drive these debtors into bankruptcy.  The acceptance of the new section is a very valuable improvement to the Bill, but a great part of its value is, as I have already stated, lost by the insertion of Sub-section 3, and I hope that before this Bill becomes an   Act, some way will be found to delete that Sub-section. 
       Motion put:&mdash;&ldquo;To insert a new section (Amendment 6), before Section 15.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
    
    
      
       I move the following amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;In Sub-section 2, line 63, to insert after the word &lsquo;and,&rsquo; and before the word &lsquo;shall,&rdquo; the words &lsquo;its provisions, except Sections 5 and 6 thereof.&rsquo;&rdquo; As printed here, 5 and 6 should read 4 and 5.  These two Clauses of the Bill I wish to propose shall not be limited to six months, but shall form part of the ordinary law.  These sections are wrongly numbered as they appear on the Order Paper, and should be 4 and 5. The Dail will remember that when this Bill was in Committee a clause was accepted directing the Sheriff to give an inventory of the goods seized to the debtor; another clause was accepted increasing from Â£5 to Â£10 the amount of bedding, tools of trade, and wearing apparel which the debtor might keep immune from the creditor.  I ask that these two sections become part of the general law.  They are not particularly appropriate to the Bill, and everyone realises that they ought to be part of the ordinary law of the land. 
    
    
      
       Deputy Gavan Duffy made what he called himself certain feeble attempts to improve this rotten measure.  His proposal now is that the feeble attempts should survive the rotten measure. 
    
    
      
       Hear, hear. 
    
    
      
       That when throwing out this bit of garbage after six months, the gems that Deputy Gavan Duffy has embodied in it should be salved. 
    
    
      
       Hear, hear. 
    
    
      
       I do not think that is a proper way to deal with the matter. Let the Bill go down unknolled, unhonoured, and unsung, including the feeble attempts; or, if the Dail in six months thinks it is not such a desperate machine of destruction and ferocity that it is represented to be, let it consider it in a calm and deliberate fashion, and decide what portion of the Bill, if any, deserves to be perpetuated.  I think we ought not   to come to a decision here and now, and pick out two gems for posterity, particularly at the instigation of the gentleman who is responsible for the gems.  I think a more impartial opinion ought to be before the Dail than that of the Deputy. 
    
    
      
       It appears to me this amendment must go down, or the Bill goes down.  To amend the ordinary law you will have to do it in a proper fashion.  I think this suggestion is irregular. 
       Amendment put and lost. 
       Question put: &ldquo;That Section 15 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
    
   
   
     THE DAIL RESUMES. 
    
      
       Sections 10 and 15 as amended in Committee are reported to the Dail. 
    
    
      
       I move that the Bill as amended in Committee be re-be received for final consideration.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I second the motion. 
       Question put: &ldquo;That the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
    
    
      
       I did not say agreed.  I said nil. 
    
    
      
       I propose to take the final stage before we adjourn. 
    
   
   
     AUTHORISATION OF PAYMENTS. 
    
      
       I move &ldquo;That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses authorised to be incurred under any Act of the present Session for the salaries and allowances of District Justices, and for making good any deficiency in the Petty Sessions Clerks' Fund.&rdquo; 
       There is authorisation from the Governor-General for this.  This resolution is rendered necessary, as the Dail understands, to give authorisation for the funds required for this Act.  I suppose there is no necessity for discussing it at any length. 
    
    
      
       Before this is put I would like to raise a question as to why we should consider this formality necessary. It was passed over on the last   occasion, and I have no doubt a case could be made out for it by quoting the example of the British House of Commons, and British practice, but it seems to me we ought not automatically to fall into this procedure unless there are substantial grounds for doing so.  I tried to understand why such a procedure is necessary in England, and so far as I could understand it, it is only necessary because of practice having its roots in a bad past, and there is absolutely no necessity for it here.  We have a Constitution which very clearly says that the Governor-General is going to act on the advice of the Executive Council. 
    
     That provision does not apply in England, and it is because of the old relationships between the Crown and the Parliament that some such provision of this kind was found in practice to be desirable to prevent evils, abuses, on the part of the Crown.  That practice has persisted over there, because of the unwritten Constitution.  I think it is not desirable, in any respect, that we should simply fall automatically into the practices of the House of Commons at Westminster, but if we are going to adopt its forms, and many of them are desirable, we should only do so when we are convinced that there is reason for it.  In this case, so far as I can see, there is no reason for it, and while I do not want to press the matter very strongly at present, I would urge upon the President the desirability of making a case, satisfying himself and satisfying the Dail that it is essential to the proper conduct of affairs that such a resolution must be passed, before the Committee stage of a Bill is entered on.  Think what it means ! We are supposed to give authorisation for the expenditure of certain moneys&mdash; amount not stated&mdash;which may be necessary to be spent, if a certain thing happens in the future, to wit the passing of an Act of Parliament.  Surely, it is clear that the passing of the Act is an indication of the intention of the Dail that the money shall be provided.  To fall, as I said, automatically into this procedure which requires a resolution containing a promise that we will vote certain moneys for certain purposes, undefined, seems to me to be without any warrant or justification.  If it is necessary that such resolution of Ways and Means should be passed&mdash;if it is not considered enough that the passing of an Act   by the Dail is automatically an assurance that we are prepared to vote the money&mdash;then such a resolution ought only to come before us when the Act has gone through, or when it is at its final stage.  There is nothing in our Constitution that requires this procedure, and unless there is good justification, that is not explainable in anything I have been able to read, I think we ought not to follow this procedure in the future, and I would hope if such resolution has to be moved at any time in the future that the President would explain the reasons for it and satisfy the Dail that these reasons are good. 
    
      
       It is in accordance with Article 37 of the Constitution that this particular procedure that has been put into operation here has had to be put forward.  The article says:&mdash;&ldquo;Money shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution or law, unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same Session been recommended by a message from the representative of the Crown, acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo; 
       Now, in this case this particular Bill is to that extent, so far as the money is concerned, a Money Bill.  Members here have on various occasions exhibited some jealousy with regard to the rights of the Dail.  I think the rights of the Dail are even recognised in the Constitution, as far as Money Bills are concerned. This particular Bill that is under consideration would conflict with Article 37 of the Constitution, because by law money would be expended which had not been the subject of a message from the representative of the Crown acting on the advice of the Executive Council. 
    
    
      
       You have it. 
    
    
      
       You have the message, but in addition to the message you require the authorisation.  I do not know where the Comptroller and Auditor-General would find his justification for making the payments in respect to this if he had not got that justification by the resolution that we have to pass.  It may be that I am not, perhaps, interpreting the point that has been made by the Deputy correctly; but, as I see the situation, first of all money&mdash; and this Bill contemplates the expenditure of money&mdash;shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution, or law   which has not been recommended by a message.  It would amount to this in essence that you have to put the responsibility on the Executive Council for bringing forward finance matters in the Dail.  The Constitution reserves to the Executive Council that right.  If the Executive Council, in the exercise of its wisdom, were not to bring forward here for approval by the Dail money resolutions, it would be a very serious infringement on the rights of the Dail.  I do not know what proposals are embodied in the Standing Orders with regard to money votes or resolutions, or other things of that sort.  I think that matter is under consideration.  There is, as far as I am aware, no express provision in the Standing Orders at the moment for matters of this kind, and in the absence of any other procedure adopted by the Dail for dealing with matters of this kind, I do not know that there is any other course open than the one we have adopted&mdash;the message, the resolution, and so on. 
    
    
      
       Standing Orders bearing on the matter will, I think, be submitted to the Dail in the course of next week, if we meet next week. 
       Resolution put and carried. 
    
   
   
     DISTRICT JUSTICES (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS)  BILL&mdash;COMMITTEE STAGE. 
     The Dail went into Committee on the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Bill. 
     SECTION 1. 
    
      
       I move the first section of the Bill.  It provides: 
       (1)  It shall be lawful for the Governor-General of the Irish Free State on the advice of the Executive Council, from time to time to appoint fit and proper persons, being Barristers-at-Law in Saorstat Eireann or Solicitors of the Supreme Court in Saorstat Eireann, to be magistrates, with the title of &ldquo;District Justices,&rdquo; and to perform the duties and have the powers prescribed by this Act. 
       (2)  Every person appointed to be a District Justice may be dismissed or removed at the pleasure of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State on the advice of the Executive Council. 
    
     
        (3)  Every person so appointed to be a District Justice shall, while he holds that office, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas such salary and allowances as the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance, shall appoint. 
     (4)  No person shall, while holding the office of District Justice, be capable of holding any other office or position of emolument, or of being elected to or of being a member of either House of the Oireachtas. 
     (5)  Every person so appointed to be a District Justice shall, before entering on his office, subscribe and make a solemn declaration in the form contained in the First Schedule to this Act. 
    
      
       I move the amendment in my name: &ldquo;In Sub-section 3, line 28, to delete all after &lsquo;Oireachtas,&rsquo; and to substitute &lsquo;a salary and allowances in accordance with a scale to be prescribed by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance.' &rdquo; The object of this is to remove from the region of chance the salaries to be paid. As it reads in the sub-section proposed, it allows varying salaries for different Justices. I do not know whether that is the intention of the Minister, but if it is not, I suggest that it is better to provide for a scale of salaries and allowances rather than have a mere chance decision of the Minister. 
    
    
      
       Certainly. 
       Amendment agreed. 
       Question put: &ldquo;That Section 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
       SECTION 2. 
       (1)  It shall be the duty of each District Justice appointed under this Act to hold District Courts at such places within the District allotted to him and at such times as shall be prescribed by the Minister. 
       (2)  A District Justice sitting in and holding a District Court pursuant to this Act shall have all the powers, jurisdiction and authority which were immediately before the 6th day of December, 1922, vested by statute or otherwise in a Justice of the Peace sitting in Petty Sessions. 
    
     (3)  Every order, decree or judgment   made or pronounced by a District Justice sitting in and holding a District Court pursuant to this Act shall be subject to the same appeal (if any) as a similar order, decree or judgment made or pronounced by a justice of the Peace sitting in Petty Sessions would have been subject to previous to the 6th day of December, 1922. 
     (4)  A District Justice shall within his District when not sitting at Petty Sessions have all the powers, authorities and duties which were immediately before the passing of this Act vested in or imposed on a Justice of the Peace. 
     (5)  Any act, matter or thing which immediately before the passing of this Act was by any statute, rule or order required or authorized to be done before or in the presence of or to be served on a Justice of the Peace shall from and after the passing of this Act (unless the same is by this Act required or authorized to be done before or in the presence of or to be served on a Parish Commissioner) be required or authorized (as the case may be) to be done or in the presence of or to be served on a District Justice. 
    
      
       This section defines the duty of the District Justices. I move this section. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move Amendment No. 3&mdash;&ldquo;In Sub-section (5), lines 9 and 10, to delete the words from &lsquo;unless the same&rsquo; to the words &lsquo;to be served,&rsquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words &lsquo;without prejudice to any power or jurisdiction conferred by this Act.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
       The object of this amendment is to ensure that even though the Parish Commissioner has power to do certain acts, a District Justice may still do the things that the Act entitles him to do. 
    
    
      
       I accept that amendment. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I had intended speaking about sub-section 2 of section 1, but my opportunity I suppose is past.  On this section I might just say that it would save something in the definition clause if the words &ldquo;or Justices&rdquo; were added.  The Minister will notice that when we come to Section   8, sub-section 2, it does refer to &ldquo;Justices,&rdquo; and in the definition clause it is stated that wherever &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; is mentioned in one of these clauses it shall be read as including &ldquo;Justices&rdquo; in such cases where more than one Justice of the Peace was required to sit. It is merely a trifling alteration.  In sub-section 3, line 50, it is stated: &ldquo;decree or judgment made or pronounced by a District Justice.&rdquo; In Section 10 &ldquo;Justices of the Peace&rdquo; is mentioned, and similarly under Section 4 you have &ldquo;imposed upon Justices of the Peace.&rdquo; This is the first Clause in which the title &ldquo;Parish Commissioner&rdquo; is employed and consequently&mdash;&mdash; 
    
    
      
       The words &ldquo;Parish Commissioner&rdquo; are deleted in accordance with the amendment just passed. 
    
    
      
       Does that preclude me from speaking about the title? 
    
    
      
       I think so.  The title will arise later. 
       Question put: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
       SECTION 3. 
       (1)  Immediately upon the passing of this Act or as soon as conveniently may be thereafter the Minister shall divide every County in Saorstat Eireann (except the County of the City of Dublin and so much of the County of Dublin as is within the jurisdiction of the Divisional Magistrates of the City of Dublin) into convenient Court Districts and shall appoint one convenient place in each such District at which the District Court shall be held for such District. 
       (2)  It shall be lawful for the Minister from time to time as he shall consider expedient to vary all or any of the Court Districts into which any County shall be divided under this section and to alter all or any of the places appointed under this section for the holding of District Courts. 
    
     (3)  Immediately upon the completion of the division of any County into Court Districts under this section such Court Districts shall for all purposes take the   place of and be substituted for the Petty Sessions Districts into which such county was divided at the passing of this Act and the District Court in and for each such District shall be held at the place appointed by the Minister under this section and Petty Sessions shall cease to be holden in that County. 
     (4)  The Minister shall allot to each District Justice as his District such and so many Court Districts constituted under this section (whether situate in the same or different counties) as the Minister shall think expedient and may from time to time as he shall think expedient vary the allotment of Court Districts to all or any of the District Justices and transfer any District Justice from the District so allotted to him to any other District. 
    
      
       I move Section 3. 
    
    
      
       I move Amendment No. 4: &ldquo;In Sub-section (1), lines 15 and 16, to delete the words &lsquo;every county in.&rsquo;&rdquo; It is not intended that the area of jurisdiction of a District Justice may be limited to a county boundary. 
    
    
      
       I accept that.  It is a necessary amendment. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
    
    
      
       In that last clause the expression &ldquo;to be served&rdquo; occurs twice and the amendment only goes down to the first use of it and it does not include the words &ldquo;Parish Commissioner.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       That is quite right.  It does not include the words &ldquo;Parish Commissioner&rdquo;&mdash;that was a mistake. 
    
    
      
       I move Amendments 5 and 6, which are consequential. Amendment 5 states: &ldquo;In Sub-section 2, line 23, to delete the words &lsquo;into which any county shall be divided,&rsquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the word &lsquo;created.&rsquo;&rdquo; Amendment 6 states: &ldquo;In Sub-section 3, lines 27 and 28, to delete the words &lsquo;of any county.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
       Amendments agreed to. 
       Motion put:&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 3 as amended stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
    
     
        SECTION 4. 
     (1)  The Minister may from time to time by warrant under his hand appoint and remove such and so many fit and proper persons as he shall think expedient in each country to be called &ldquo;Parish Commissioners,&rdquo; and to perform and exercise within such country the duties and powers prescribed by this Act. 
     (2)  A Parish Commissioner shall have all the powers and authorities which immediately before the passing of this Act were vested in a Justice of the Peace in respect of the several matters following, that is to say:&mdash; 
     
       (a)   signing Petty Sessions Summonses; 
     
       (b)   signing Warrants; 
     
       (c)   Administering oaths and taking declarations and affirmations; 
     
       (d)   committing dangerous lunatics and idiots to Lunatic Asylums under Section 10 of the Lunacy (Ireland) Act, 1867 (30 &amp; 31 Vict., ch. 118); 
     
       (e)   signing certificates for the admission of pauper lunatics and idiots to Lunatic Asylums: 
     Provided always that any summons against any member of the Civic Guard shall be signed by a District Justice. 
     (3)  Whenever any person charged with having committed an indictable offence shall be arrested by a member of the Civic Guard such person shall forthwith be brought before a Parish Commissioner who, after hearing such evidence as may be offered shall remand such person either in custody or in such bail as the Parish Commissioner shall think fit until the next District Court to be held in the Court District where such person was arrested. 
     (4)  Whenever any person charged with having committed an indictable offence is brought before a District Justice at any District Court it shall be lawful for such District Justice to remand such person until the next District Court to be held at the same place notwithstanding that more than eight days will elapse before the holding of such next District Court. 
    
      
       I move Section 4.  It deals with Parish Commissioners. 
    
    
      
       It seems to   me that while it is expedient to create this sort of subordinate official, and to give him these powers&mdash;it will be a great relief to the District Justice&mdash;that the title &ldquo;Parish Commissioner,&rdquo; though of its nature a descriptive term, fails utterly to describe the character of the office. He is the Justice of the Peace of former days with the very important exception that he does not adjudicate upon the bench.  He is &ldquo;Commissioner of the Peace,&rdquo; but if you style him &ldquo;Parish Commissioner&rdquo; it does suggest, I think, a parallel with Urban Commissioner, Commissioner of Trade, and so on.  In other words Commissioner is a title associated in our minds with functions of a far higher grade, and of a much greater importance than those.  When you study what his main duties are in relation to the Justice you find he is a sort of coadjutor&mdash;I am borrowing a term from the Church&mdash;to the District Justice. He remits to the District Justice and in England there is the title used of &ldquo;Committing Magistrate,&rdquo; and in a sense this officer is to be a remitting magistrate, but the whole position is so subordinate that I once more beg the Minister to give the office a less ambitious title. 
    
    
      
       I am not particularly bigotted in favour of the term &ldquo;Parish Commissioner,&rdquo; but it is a question of the lack of any better suggestion. It must be remembered that this is an honorary position, and it might be no harm seeing that the position is honorary that the title should be somewhat high-sounding in the complete absence of anything else to commend it.  We thought of Local Commissioner and so on, but if you call him Commissioner there are so many Commissioners, Commissioner for Oaths, Land Commissioner, etc.  Commissioner is in a way a fairly accurate description, because he deals largely with the taking of affidavits, signing of warrants, the administering of Oaths, committing dangerous lunatics, signing certificates for the admission of pauper lunatics, etc.  What we wanted to emphasise was the refusal to go back to the honorary magistrates of the past where people subject to local prejudice had the task of administering the law. I think while I would welcome any   other suggestion that my own view would be to adhere to the present title. 
    
    
      
       There is one solid advantage which I hope will appeal to Deputy McGuinness, and it is this: The words &ldquo;Parish Commissioner&rdquo; will undoubtedly be contracted to &ldquo;P.C.,&rdquo; and as we are dropping Privy Councillor, this may be regarded as a fair exchange. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move in Sub-section (3) to delete the word &ldquo;until,&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words, &ldquo;and remit the case for hearing before a District Justice on a date not later than.&rdquo; The object is to provide for particular cases.  A case may be brought before a District Justice on a date earlier than would have been convenient for the District Court. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move in Sub-section (4) to delete the words after the word &ldquo;held,&rdquo; which are &ldquo;at the same place, notwithstanding that more than eight days will elapse before the holding of such next District Court,&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;by him in any Court District in the same or in adjoining county.&rdquo; The object of this amendment is to ensure that the prisoner shall be brought to trial in a reasonable time.  As the clause stands it would be lawful for the District Justice to remand such persons until the next District Court to be held at some place, notwithstanding that eight days will have elapsed before the holding of such next District Court.  It might be that a month will elapse.  There is no limit, as the clause stands, to the time that the person may be kept in prison without being brought before a Court.  It has been considered for many generations desirable that there should be some public proof that the prisoner who is arrested and not tried still lives, and that even if the prosecution is not ready to pursue the case against him, still the prisoner shall be presented and a remand granted.  Now we are removing that according to the Bill, and leaving it to the Justices to decide when the prisoner shall be brought forward without any limit of time.  The limit of eight days hitherto prevailing is being removed.  I think the objection to that is the difficulty which will arise by virtue of the fact that the District Justice will not be sitting in Court in these particular places   more than twice a month.  He will be sitting in his district, and the object of the amendment is to ensure that the prisoner shall be brought forward to some Court in some part of the district within a reasonable period.  It is with that object that I move this amendment, which will have the effect of allowing the eight days' limit to continue. 
    
    
      
       I should be inclined to accept that amendment provided it is clearly understood that the District Justice has full discretion in each case as to where he will remand to, and so on. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Question &ldquo;That Section 4, as amended, stand part of the Bill,&rdquo; put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 5. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move Section 5:&mdash; 
       (1)  From and after the passing of this Act the existing offices of Clerk of Petty Sessions shall cease to exist and every existing Clerk of Petty Sessions shall cease to hold his office. 
       (2)  From and after the passing of this Act the Minister shall and may from time to time as occasion requires appoint fit and proper persons to be District Court Clerks in the several Court Districts constituted under this Act and may appoint each such person to be District Court Clerk in one or in any greater number of such Court Districts. 
       (3)  Each District Court Clerk appointed under this section shall hold his office by such tenure as the Minister shall prescribe and shall be paid such salary as the Minister shall with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance appoint. 
       (4)  The salaries of the District Court Clerks appointed under this section shall be paid out of the same funds as the salaries of the existing Clerks of Petty Sessions have been heretofore paid and any deficiency in such funds to meet the amounts of such salaries shall be made good out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. 
    
     (5)  Each District Court Clerk appointed under this Act shall perform in respect of his District or Districts the like duties as have heretofore been performed by the existing Clerks of Petty Sessions in respect of the existing Petty Sessions Districts and shall also perform such   other duties as shall from time to time be allotted to him by the District Justice. 
     (6)  The existing office of Registrar of Petty Sessions Clerks shall from and after the passing of this Act be called &ldquo;The Registrar of District Court Clerks&rdquo; and such Registrar shall perform in relation to the District Court Clerks appointed under this section the like duties as he has heretofore performed in relation to the existing Clerks of Petty Sessions. 
     (7)  In this section the word &ldquo;existing&rdquo; means existing on the 6th day of December, 1922. 
     This bears upon the appointment of Clerks to the District Courts. 
    
      
       I beg to move in Sub-section (3) to delete all the words after the word &ldquo;paid,&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;a salary in accordance with a scale to be prescribed by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I accept that amendment. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I was rather precipitate in accepting Deputy Johnson's amendment just now.  It would be very difficult to draw up a scale of payment on the question of clerks' remuneration. It is not the same thing as District Justices. It will depend very much upon a variety of circumstances, such as the number of districts assigned to each clerk and the distance between these places and so on.  There will be considerations affecting the clerks which would make it very difficult to arrive at anything like uniformity in the matter of remuneration, and from my own experience of the thing up to the present I should say it is very much a matter simply of dealing with each particular case.  You cannot say the remuneration would be so many pounds.  Clerks having three areas and three courts in their charge, might have them clustered quite close together in the case of one man, in a certain area, while in the case of another man in another area, for instance, in the West of Ireland, they may be very far distant from one another.  There are a variety of circumstances like that, that would make the adoption of a definite scale a difficult matter. 
    
     
    
      
       The amendment has been passed. 
    
    
      
       I was more or less asking indulgence to re-open that matter. 
    
    
      
       I recognise the point made by the Minister, but I suggested that he will find a way to devise a scale to allow that elasticity.  As it stands there is no assurance that the officers of the court would know, within any limits, what the scale would be.  I suggest that if on further consideration the Minister finds that this is not possible he can get the amendment eliminated in the Seanad, but I think he will find it possible on consideration to devise a scale leaving a wide range in such extraordinary cases as those of which he speaks. 
    
    
      
       Better leave the amendment now, and at the next stage here, or in another place if it is necessary, further amendment could be made. 
    
    
      
       I would ask leave to move an amendment in Clause (5), sub-section (4), line 31, to insert after the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the words &ldquo;to such extent as the Minister for Finance may sanction,&rdquo; and to add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;provided that nothing of this sub-section shall prejudice the power of deduction conferred by Section (2) of the Petty Sessions Clerks (Ireland) Act, 1881.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Supposing we take part I of the amendment first. 
    
    
      
       Very good.  The first part deals with a matter which provides against any misunderstanding on the part of the Dail.  The continual insertion of the Office of the Ministry of Finance is not an overdose of that. It is the Dail's security for the control of funds and having a particular person responsible rather than having the responsibility distributed over a number of Ministers.  For example, in connection with Dail funds, although a particular Minister may have a fund under his control, the details and the distribution is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, and it is for that purpose I am   moving these amendments, and accordingly, therefore, I move the first part now. 
    
    
      
       I take it that leave is given and the question now is that the first part of the amendment be agreed to. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I beg now to move the second portion.  To add at the end of sub-section (4) the words &ldquo;provided that nothing in this sub-section shall prejudice the power of deduction conferred by Section (2) of the Petty Sessions Clerks (Ireland) Act, 1881. 
       That amendment deals with an existing right in connection with this Petty Sessions Fund.  It appears that there is power under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1881, to supplement the Petty Sessions Fund by transferring money out of the fund made up of the proceeds of the Dog Tax, and it is conceivable that this particular clause as it stands would prejudice that right.  It is to retain that right that this second part of my amendment is put forward, and to make it quite clear that there should be no misunderstanding in retaining rights already existing. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move to insert after Sub-section (5) a new sub-section, as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;Each District Court Clerk appointed under this Act shall have in each County in which any part of his district or districts is situate, the same power and authority to sign District Court Summonses as is by this Act conferred on a Parish Commissioner in that County.&rdquo; 
       The only object is to provide the clerk with further facilities in connection with the signing of summonses. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
       Question: &ldquo;That Section (5), as amended, stands part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
       Put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 6. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move Section (6):&mdash; 
    
     Every act, matter and thing which was on the 6th day of December, 1922, required or authorised by law to be done by or in the presence of or to be served   on an Inspector, Sergeant, Constable or other member of the Royal Irish Constabulary at or in connection with or in relation to any Petty Sessions shall from and after the passing of this Act be required or authorised to be done by an Inspector, Sergeant, Constable or other member (as the case may require) of the Civic Guard at or in connection with or in relation to a District Court. 
    
      
       I beg to move an amendment to insert after the words &ldquo;to be done by&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or in the presence of or to be served on.&rdquo; 
       This is merely a correction of a clerical error. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Question: &ldquo;That Section (6), as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
       Put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 7. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move Section (7):&mdash; 
       All fees which are at the passing of this Act payable by law at or in connection with Petty Sessions or are payable to or collectable by the Clerk of Petty Sessions or are denoted or paid by Petty Sessions Stamps (including the Dog Tax) shall continue to be payable at the like times and in the like manner as heretofore but with the modifications that all such fees except the Dog Tax shall from and after the passing of this Act be charged and paid at double the rate at which same were heretofore charged and paid and that the District Court, the District Court Clerk and District Court Stamps shall be substituted respectively for Petty Sessions, the Clerk of Petty Sessions and Petty Sessions Stamps. 
       Question: &ldquo;That Section (7) stand part of the Bill,&rdquo; put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 8. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move Section (8):&mdash; 
       (1)  Each of the persons named in the Third Schedule to this Act having been appointed under the Constabulary (Ireland) Act, 1836 (6 and 7 Will. IV., ch. 13), by the Governor-General of the Irish Free State to be a Magistrate under that Act, shall be deemed to have been appointed and to be a District Justice under this Act. 
    
     
        (2)  Every act, matter and thing done after the 22nd day of October, 1922, by any of the said persons named in the Third Schedule to this Act, in exercise or purported exercise of any authority purported to have been at the time of his doing such act, matter or thing vested in him by reason of his having been appointed or purported to have been appointed by the late Provisional Government of Ireland, or any Minister thereof, to be a District Justice, shall, notwithstanding any failure (whether by way of commission or omission) to comply with any statute, rule or order, or any other irregularity be as valid and effective as if the same had been done by a Magistrate duly appointed under the Constabulary (Ireland) Act, 1836 (6 and 7 Will. IV., ch. 13), or (in the case of acts, matters and things which are by law required to be done by two Magistrates appointed under the Act aforesaid sitting together), by two such Magistrates sitting together. 
     (3)  No action shall lie against and no penalty shall be incurred by any of the said persons named in the Third Schedule to this Act for or on account or in respect of any act, matter or thing done by any such person after the 22nd day of October, 1922, in exercise or purported exercise of any such authority as is mentioned in the preceding sub-section, or any failure (whether by way of commission or omission) to comply with the terms of any statute, rule or order or any other irregularity in the doing of such act, matter, or thing. 
    
      
       I beg to move in Sub-section (2) an amendment to delete the figures &ldquo;22nd,&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the figures &ldquo;28th.&rdquo; 
       Amendment agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move an amendment in line 17 to insert after the words &ldquo;same has been,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;regularly.&rdquo; 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Question:&mdash;&ldquo;That Section (8), as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 9. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move Section (9): 
    
     (1)  Every mention or reference contained in any British Statute, or in any order, rule or regulation made under any   British Statute of or to any of the officials, courts, districts or things mentioned in the first column of the Second Schedule to this Act shall, in respect of the doing or not doing of any act, matter or thing in Saorstat Eireann after the passing of this Act, be construed and take effect as a reference to the official, court, district or thing named in the second colum of the said Second Schedule opposite the name of the official, court, district or thing in the first column. 
     (2)  In this section the expression &ldquo;British Statute&rdquo; means Act of the Parliament of the late United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which was on the 6th day of December, 1922, in force in the area now comprised in Saorstat Eireann. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section (9) stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash; put and agreed to. 
     SECTION 10. 
    
      
       I beg to move Section (10): 
       In this Act the following expressions shall, where the context so admits, have the meanings respectively assigned to them by this section&mdash;that is to say, &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo; means the member of the Executive Council who is for the time being Minister for Home Affairs; &ldquo;Justice of the Peace&rdquo; means and includes all the following persons, namely: 
       
         (a)   One Justice of the Peace sitting or acting alone; 
       
         (b)   two or more Justices of the Peace sitting or acting together; 
       
         (c)   one Magistrate appointed under the Constabulary (Ireland) Act, 1836 (6 and 7 Will. IV., ch 13); 
       
         (d)   two such Magistrates sitting or acting together: 
       &ldquo;Civic Guard&rdquo; means the police force in Saorstat Eireann which is at the passing of this Act commonly called or known as the Civic Guard. 
    
    
      
       I move as an amendment, in line 48, to delete the words &ldquo;Member of the Executive Council who is for the time being.&rdquo; The object of this amendment is to correct an error, or rather, perhaps, an assumption in the Bill as it stands.  The Minister means a member of the Executive Council, and it is not provided in the Constitution that the Minister for Home Affairs shall be a member of the Executive Council. 
    
     
    
      
       I accept the amendment. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Clause (10) as amended stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 11. 
    
    
      
       I move Section 11:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;This Act may be cited as The District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I beg to move as an amendment:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;To add a new Sub-section (2): &ldquo;This Act shall continue in force for one calendar year after the passing thereof and shall then expire.&rdquo; 
       The intention of this amendment is to ensure that the temporary nature of this Bill will be quite definite.  It is called &ldquo;The Temporary Provisions Bill,&rdquo; and the suggestion is that in the ordinary course of events it should expire in twelve months.  The period is immaterial as far as I am concerned, but I want to make sure that this is a temporary Bill and I am rather more concerned with that aspect of it, because I do not want to prejudice the decision of the Judiciary Committee regarding the relations of the Judiciary with the Executive Council.  I was rather alarmed with the view taken by the Minister in discussing this matter before, and his conception of the proper relations between the Executive Council and the Judiciary, even subordinate Judiciary. While it may be quite acceptable for a temporary Bill to allow a Justice to be removable at the discretion of the political Executive for the time being, I think it would be very undesirable to have that a permanent provision, hence the desire to make it quite clear that it is a temporary Bill. 
    
    
      
       I beg to support the amendment, although I do not think that the words &ldquo;for one year&rdquo; are quite what the Deputy intended. We were assured that this measure was to fill a void pending the results to ensue upon the findings of the Judiciary Committee. What I spoke on Section 2 of the Bill on the Second Reading I spoke with the full intention of evoking an   opinion from this Dail as to what ought to be the tenure of office arranged for District Justices.  I may have been so bent upon emphasising what ought to be as to have forgotten for the moment that this was a temporary measure.  It is most desirable in view of our having passed, without any qualification whatever, Sub-section 2 of Section 1 that no opportunity should be missed for emphasising the purely temporary character of the measure.  It seems to me that unless that is done and unless what Deputy Johnson has just done be done by the Dail our action may be interpreted as favouring a doctrine that because a District Justice is only a superior type of Justice of the Peace he might hold without any detriment to the public advantage this minor office at the discretion of the Ministry.  With a great deal that the Minister for Home Affairs said on this point I throughly agree.  It is eminently desirable that there should be some check upon the exercise of their functions vested in the Ministry that they should be subject to review and criticism in this Dail, but I suggested and would again suggest that this Dail ought to record the view that while ample provision is made for such consideration for the discharge of their duties as may be rendered necessary still that the absolutely final dismissal from office should not vest in the Ministry because of the political possibilities that I outlined on a former occasion, but that a rota of judges should be set up.  I thought of indicating that rota in a Schedule, so I support the amendment to keep this emphatically a temporary measure&mdash;preferably a measure functioning only until the Judiciary Committee has finally settled the matter&mdash;so that our meaning here be not misconstrued.  I think it would be a hardship if the gentlemen whose names are set out in the Third Schedule were to be left under the impression that this Dail was wholly satisfied to make them tenants at will of that position. 
    
    
      
       I accept the amendment. 
       Amendment accepted and agreed to. 
       Question put:&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 11, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
       SCHEDULES. 
    
     
    
      
       I beg to move the First Schedule:&mdash; 
    
     &ldquo;I ................................ do swear that I will well and truly serve the Irish Free State (Saorstat Eireann) in the office of District Justice without favour or affection, malice or ill-will; that I will see and cause the peace to be kept and preserved; that I will prevent to the best of my power all offences against the same; that while I shall continue to hold the said office I will to the best of my skill and knowledge discharge all the duties thereof in the execution of Warrants and otherwise faithfully according   to law, and that I do not now belong to, and that while I shall hold the said office I will not join or belong to any political society whatsoever or any secret society whatsoever.  So help me God.&rdquo; 
     This Schedule contains the oath which the District Justices who have been appointed up to the present have taken, and I move that it be continued. 
    
      
       Does the Minister think that it is any good? 
    
    
      
       No. 
       Question put:&mdash;&ldquo;That Schedule I, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move Schedule 2:&mdash;

       The amendment is to delete the word &ldquo;provide,&rdquo; line 8, and to substitute the words &ldquo;make temporary provision.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       It is consequential on the amendments on the other clauses.  The title will now read, as Amendment 1 is accepted, &ldquo;An Act to make Temporary Provision for the appointment of District Justices.&rdquo; The title as amended therefore stands. 
    
   
   
     [  DAIL RESUMES. ] 
    
      
       The Bill as amended is now reported to the Dail. When is it proposed to take the Report Stage? 
    
    
      
       It would depend really on when the reprint would be ready. 
    
     
    
      
       It would not be ready till Friday. 
    
    
      
       We could not take the Report Stage then until next Wednesday. 
    
    
      
       The Fourth Stage on Wednesday. 
    
   
   
     ENFORCEMENT OF LAW BILL SENT TO SEANAD. 
    
      
       I move that the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Bill be now passed and be sent to the Seanad.  I hope that the Bill will be read carefully through the country. 
    
    
      
       I second the motion. 
    
    
      
       Are we to understand that no decrees of the Dail Courts will be executed under this Act until they have first been revised? 
    
    
      
       Are not these decrees at present under revision? 
    
    
      
       No decree of the Dail Courts will be executed under this Act, unless and until it has been recommended by this Dail.  There will have to be legislation here bearing on that whole matter, and the report of the Committee which is looking into this question of winding up Dail Courts is not yet before us.  It will be brought before the Dail and the decrees of the Courts will be duly validated by this body&mdash;such decrees as it is thought fit to have executed. 
       Motion put: &ldquo;That the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Bill, 1923, be passed.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
    
   
   
     ADJOURNMENT OF THE DaIL. - BALLYCONNELL RAID. 
    
      
       I move: &ldquo;That the Dail do adjourn until 3 o'clock to-morrow.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I second the motion. 
    
    
      
       I am very reluctant at all times to prolong discussion here unnecessarily, but this morning's Press relates an incident in my constituency of a serious and, I think, most appalling nature, and I think that I would be neglecting my duty as representative   of that constituency, if I did not take the first opportunity that presented itself in this Assembly to concentrate, in so far as it is possible, the attention of the Dail and public opinion upon that incident.  We have been accustomed for some time past to strange and startling events.  We have gradually become habituated to occurrences that a few years ago we considered foreign to the temperament of this country, and foreign to conceptions (f how to resolve our political differences. Many things have occurred that have surprised and pained us, but I do not think anything has occurred since anarchy challenged authority in this country so appalling as that which is related in to-day's Press.  Appalling, I think, is no term of exaggeration by which to refer to this event.  I do not know how far the daily Press has stated the exact truth of this occurence.  I should be very glad indeed to read that it was wholly untrue, or that it had been largely exaggerated, but it stated that yesterday morning about 8 a.m. a gang of 80 armed men swept down upon a little town in County Cavan and proceeded to engage in one of those exploits which horrify not only this country, but humanity, or at least the civilised world when it becomes aware of them&mdash;one of those exploits which was rather a common occurrence during the Black and Tan regime in Ireland, before the Treaty of peace between Ireland and Great Britain put an end to their regime of terrorism.  &ldquo;Two civilians were shot dead and one injured in such a way that his life may be jeopardised; houses and business premises were fired and destroyed, and a wild panic followed amongst the inhabitants, as the murderers proceeded with their work. Women and children ran hither and thither seeking refuge from the flying bullets and bomb splinters.&rdquo; Now the reason I have raised this question is mainly to give the Government an opportunity of stating if these particulars, as related in the columns of the Press, are actual facts or are wild exaggerations. I do not know if there is any element in this country prepared to stand over such hideous proceedings as these. 
    
     We have drifted a long, long way in Ireland from that standard of judgment which was supposed to be in existence   when a prominent personage in this country stated there was a Constitutional way of resolving our differences; let us not depart from it.  I want to know&mdash;I would be glad to know, but no one in this Dail can inform me&mdash;if the personage who gave utterance to that sentiment believes that what happened at Ballyconnell is a constitutional way of resolving our differences.  But this episode&mdash;at least the particulars as set forth&mdash;if true &mdash;are a startling revelation upon the vital need of standing by the authority that means&mdash;is determined&mdash;to bring back the nation from these frightful excesses to the constitutional ways of settling differences of opinion.  I have said nothing in this Dail, I think, up to the present, that could be construed as harsh criticism of the Government.  I do not intend to say anything now.  Their task has been one which no man need envy.  It has been a task that would have taxed to a supreme degree the calibre, qualities and the resources of any set of men, for they have had not only to take over the machinery of Government, but also to utilise it in a certain sense through improvised methods, and that, too, at a time when not merely their authority, but the whole principle of representative Government was challenged by men, or by persons, who regarded the ballot box as a very, very inferior apparatus to that of the bomb or the bullet.  Therefore, I say, they have had a task of supreme difficulty, and no word of mine shall add to their difficulty.  But I do think that it requires some explanation&mdash;some information&mdash;as to why the town&mdash;not a very large town, in the sense, say, of a large metropolis like Dublin, or of a city like Cork, but a town of considerable importance in the values of county towns, a very considerable centre of county life &mdash;as to why eighty marauders could sweep down, take human life, bomb and fire certain buildings and create general panic and consternation amongst the people.  I have no wish, by asking these questions, to say or do anything that would create embarrassment of a Government that is already beset with embarrassments that would try the heart and the brain of any set of men.  But I do say that incidents like these make us realise this, that if turbulence is to be quelled, that if these elements that are prepared to destroy human life, property   and civilisation, are to be combatted, then the Government must call to their aid, and must have at their disposal, all the resources that this nation can provide, and the one thing that will stand out as a moral from this incident is this, that if the resources already at the disposal of the Government are not adequate to meet the dangers with which the people are confronted then the people will not stand to be shot down like dogs by gangs of marauders, but will have to take ways and means of providing for their own protection from the assaults of these assassins.  This incident, I say, is an appalling one.  I hope it is not an indication that this is the next stage of the campaign to intimidate this nation from asserting its rights.  At least, I think it would be well if we here in this Assembly regarded it as such, and if the Goverment regarded it as such, and took steps to meet such an attack upon life from the ranks of the nation, and made these assassins, and all that they stand for, realise that this nation has endured too much to be beaten now, and that the people who stood up before the resources of a great Empire are not going to quail or cower before the blows of a gang of assassins.  I have raised this question, first, because I consider it my duty to the people I represent that their wrongs should be voiced here, and that they should realise that the Parliament of the nation is taking cognisance of the injury that has been inflicted upon them; and, secondly, because I want to ask the Government to inform us whether or not this report is the result of the diseased imaginings of some fantastic journalist, or whether it is a statement of the actual facts of a very tragic episode, and, if so, what is the reason why such things can be done with impunity.  I am sorry that the occasion should have come about to raise this question; but this having happened, I do think that it is due to this Assembly, and due to the people who have suffered this appalling atrocity, that the Government responsible for the welfare of the Irish nation should let us know what they have to say about it. 
    
      
       Does any other Deputy wish to speak? 
    
    
      
       Afterwards perhaps. 
    
    
      
       I would rather that anybody else who has anything to say would speak first.  I am taken at a   disadvantage in not getting notice of a question of this sort.  I only heard of it coming into the Dail. 
    
    
      
       It would not be very easy to give notice, because it only appeared in to-day's Press.  I asked after questions were finished to-day if it would be advisable to raise this matter for the purpose of obtaining information. There were other Ministers here, and the Ceann Comhairle said it would be better to raise the matter on the adjournment. I took it that the President would be informed by his colleagues that the matter would be raised.  I certainly have no wish to take the Minister at a disadvantage or to do anything that would be discourteous. 
    
    
      
       I regret that I did not hear until two or three moments ago, when coming into the Dail, that this matter was going to be raised.  I have no information on the matter at all.  I understand one of the Ministers has gone to get in touch with the Minister for Defence. That is what he told me when leaving the Dail.  I much regret not having information of the fact that the matter was going to be raised.  I have only got to say that some recent reports that have been circulated and that have appeared in the Press have been, I think, more than exaggerations.  I am not in a position to say anything at all about this matter, but if the Deputy will agree I would undertake to get whatever information is available for the Dail here to-morrow at 3 o'clock and we could take it up after questions if the Dail agrees. I have been taken by surprise, and I regret I had not heard of this question. 
    
    
      
       A Chinn Chomhairle, I think Deputy Milroy has done a service in raising this question.  The occurence is, as he said, an appalling one&mdash;appalling for the people who have suffered, but without minimising that in any way it is perhaps more appalling for the country as a whole and surely calls for a statement from the Minister for Defence in explanation of this particular incident, following upon so many other incidents of a very disquieting character. Several occasions have arisen when Ministers were invited openly or by suggestion to make a statement in regard to the Army, the position of the defence   forces of the country, and their relation to the function of defence.  The last two or three weeks have shown the country that there are very many defects somewhere, and this is surely the crowning defect.  I think the President would be well advised if he would prevail upon the Minister for Defence to make a full and frank statement to the Dail and to the country on the question, militarily and politically, because as he suggested the other day there was a political side to this question. 
       There should be a full and frank statement made to-morrow to the Dail and to the country of the position and reasons why it should be possible for an attack to be made by 80 men upon a small town in Co. Cavan following upon attacks by smaller numbers but over very large areas indeed and in so many different forms.  As I said I think Deputy Milroy has deserved well of the Dail in raising this matter in the way he has done, and as he stated in the early stages of these proceedings he desired to give an opportunity to the Ministers to make an explanation that I think should be availed of to-morrow, and it should not be an explanation merely of the Ballyconnell calamity but of the whole military position with which the country is faced. 
    
    
      
       The Minister for Defence I gather has not at the moment authentic information which he could usefully disclose to the Dail with reference to this particular incident.  No doubt he will make a statement to-morrow bearing on that matter.  But I want to combat the view that it was a natural thing to expect that a body of Irishmen would descend upon this little town and proceed to murder their fellow-citizens. It was not a natural thing.  It is perhaps the most unnatural thing that has happened since this unnatural strife began.  And many unnatural things have happened, but in the absence of reliable authentic information beyond what was disclosed in the Press one can only surmise that this was the act of Mr. Frank Aiken and his band&mdash; that mad dog who has been rushing in and out across the Border for many months&mdash;not that he is quite a mad dog when he is on the Six County side of the Border line.  Because Mr. Frank Aiken in the Six Counties is a very good   boy indeed.  Mr. Frank Aiken presumably is a Republican.  He would like to be called so.  I have no doubt that it is in the name of the Republic that he murders his unarmed fellow-citizens. I do not know whether he is a Republican for 32 or 26 Counties, but what I do know is that he is very glad of the benevolent protection of the Border and of this Government in the North East which presumably he does not recognise. We can all sympathise with the relatives of the men who have been murdered, and we can sympathise with the townspeople as a whole.  We can sympathise too with the many others throughout the country who have suffered at the hands of those people who are endeavouring to loose anarchy in the country, with the mothers of the babes that were wantonly burned, with the widow of the I.R.A. officer (killed in Easter week) who was burned out some time ago in Mountjoy Square.  Her husband was killed in Easter week and she was burned out in Mountjoy Square by those ruffians who never, nine-tenths of them, never handled a gun until the British evacuated the country.  That lady contracted a cold on the night she was burned out of her little flat and she has been ordered out of the country by her physician.  These are the things that have to be faced.  There are individual tragedies and there is the national tragedy.  Anarchy was loosed in this country&mdash;wantonly loosed, callously loosed, deliberately loosed&mdash;and the men that loosed this saw it coming and knew it was coming, and had ample opportunity to measure the guilt of him who would press the button to set it loose. But the button was pressed, and hundreds of young men through the country, young fellows in their teens, are being made the dupes of one man's vanity. He calls them out in the name of the Republic.  Some of us know the irony of that.  Some of us know that he taught us the necessity for compromise, and taught us the immorality, so to speak, of persisting when there was no hope of success, and of keeping the country under the harrow of British oppression   simply for a formula.  There is only one way to deal with anarchy, and that is the way of force.  If there was another way, you can take it that this Government and the Army Council which serves it would take the other way.  But there is no other way.  We will take that way of force, and we will take it very thoroughly indeed; but we expect from the people in whose name and on whose behalf it will be taken, understanding and support&mdash;understanding that you have here a problem of men who have long since ceased to think, of men who are not open to reason, who do not argue or think by the standards along which you and I and rational men think, but who reply to you with cliches, &ldquo;The people have no right to do wrong.&rdquo; Consequently men are murdered in Ballyconnell, women are burned out in Mountjoy Square, and babies are burned elsewhere. Now, we are living in a world of facts, and there are times when it takes more courage to face facts than to face machine guns.  But facts are stubborn things and have to be faced, and men were big enough to face them on the 6th December, 1921, and other men were small enough to stab them when they came home, having done their best for the Irish nation.  We, at any rate, are looking this situation in the eye.  It may be that some people even now will review the situation, and will ask themselves what it is all about.  Some people may do that.  Some people almost certainly will not.  Those who will not pause and think now can expect nothing from the hands of those who have a mandate to safeguard the lives and property and the interests of the people of Ireland&mdash;of the people of Ireland living to-day and of the people who will be born into Ireland in the future&mdash;they can expect nothing at their hands but the treatment that one would mete out to so many wild beasts if they were loosed within your territory. 
       Question put and agreed to: &ldquo;That the Dail do now adjourn until to-morrow at 3 o'clock.&rdquo; 
       The Dail adjourned at 6.20 p.m.
