     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ARRESTED OR INTERNED GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES. 
    
      
       asked the President if the Committee which was set up some months ago to investigate the cases of Government employees who were arrested or interned since July, 1922, has yet furnished its Report, and if not, if he will state how soon the Report may be expected. 
    
    
      
       The Advisory Committee has not yet completed its investigations, but it is hoped to furnish to the Government within the next week an Interim Report covering the cases in which the Committee is satisfied that the persons concerned were not guilty of complicity with the Irregular Forces.  In the remaining cases it will be necessary to give the persons concerned an opportunity of stating their cases in person before the Committee, and steps to this end are now being taken.  The Committee will make every endeavour to furnish their final report with the least possible delay. 
    
    
      
       Is the President aware that some of these concerned are married men who have been released for over twelve months and who have got no pay since? 
    
    
      
       About 400 cases were referred to this Committee, and in 126 cases the Committee have found that there was complicity with the Irregulars. In the other cases, or in the majority of them, at any rate, the Committee   are satisfied that evidence exists that there was complicity.  So far as they are concerned, they are going to give them an opportunity of appearing before them with a view to making their case. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CITY PARKS. 
    
      
       asked the President whether the Government have considered the desirability of taking the necessary steps to have the Parks at Parnell Square and elsewhere in the city thrown open to the people of the surrounding congested areas; whether, if under the existing law there is no power to do this, he will introduce a short Bill empowering the Government to nationalise these parks; and whether he could undertake to have such a measure introduced so that the parks would be open to the public in time for the Tailteann Games in August next. 
    
    
      
       The Squares to which the question refers were enclosed and are governed by bodies constituted under private Acts.  Legislation would be necessary to transfer to the Government the property of those bodies which would also have to be compensated.  The proposal is not one which could be dealt with hurriedly, and separate consideration would have to be given to the circumstances of each Square.  I regret that in the existing congested state of public business, I can see no prospect of sufficient time being made available for giving to the proposal the mature consideration which it requires.  In the case of Stephen's Green, Lord Ardilaun expended £50,000 of his own money in providing that for a park. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - VOLUNTEER ACCIDENTALLY SHOT. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that Mrs. Mary Brougham, Quarry Street, Shillelagh, County Wicklow, has not received a pension or gratuity in respect of her son, Volunteer Myles Brougham, who was accidentally shot in the Military Barracks, Lismore Castle, Co. Waterford, on October 2nd, 1922; and   whether, as this woman is in very poor circumstances at present, as her husband is an invalid in hospital for the past twelve months, her claim will be expedited. 
    
    
      
       A gratuity of £50 has been awarded to Mrs. Brougham, under the provisions of the Army Pensions Act, 1923.  She was informed accordingly on the 17th ultimo, and requested to complete and return a form of life certificate which was sent to her at the same time.  The form has not yet been received from her.  When it is received payment of the award will be made at once. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - WICKLOW CLAIM. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Defence if he is now in a position to state whether a decision has been taken on the claim of Mrs. Elizabeth Snell, High Street, Wicklow, in respect of the death of her husband, William Snell, who was shot at Avoca on June 3rd, 1922, and whether he will expedite payment of this claim. 
    
    
      
       replying: The application referred to by the Deputy has been heard by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, who have recommended that an ex-gratia payment of £75 should be made to the applicant.  A paying order for this amount will be issued in a few days. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - PRE-TRUCE CLAIM OF MEENAHELABRIDGE CREAMERY. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state the cause of the delay in the hearing of the case of the Meenahelabridge Co-operative Creamery, Abbeyfeale, for damages before the Woods Renton Commission; and whether he is aware that the delay in the hearing of this case is causing grave financial loss to the Society. 
    
    
      
       The claim referred to by the Deputy has been ruled upon by the Compensation Commission as not within the scope of their terms of reference. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - SLIGO SHOOTING&mdash;CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION. 
     
    
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the grounds on which Mr. John Kivlehan, of William Street, Sligo, was refused compensation for the death of his father, James Kivlehan, who was accidentally shot in the course of an engagement between National Forces and Irregulars on July 6th, 1922. 
    
    
      
       The application of the person named by the Deputy was carefully considered by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, and refused by them on the ground that there was no dependency of the applicant upon the deceased. 
    
    
      
       Arising out of that answer, will the Minister represent to the Commission the desirability of stating the grounds on which compensation is refused when they inform the applicant that no compensation is payable, as otherwise unnecessary questions are put? 
    
    
      
       I will consider that, though I am sure that the applicants generally know pretty well why the applications are refused. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - BALLINTUBBER NATIONAL SCHOOL PREMISES. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the schoolhouse at Ballintubber, Co. Roscommon, is in an insanitary and dangerous condition and is wholly unsuitable for the purposes of a school; whether proposals for the erection of a new building to replace the existing one were made so long as twenty-five years ago; whether these proposals have been renewed on several occasions since but nothing has so far been done; whether it is a fact that a suitable site was given by the late Congested Districts Board some years ago, and, if so, if that site is still available; and whether, in view of the dangers incurred by pupils and teachers who attend this school, he will take steps to have the work of erecting a new school building in this district put in hand at the earliest possible opportunity. 
    
     
    
      
       The existing Ballintubber schoolhouse is reported to be unsuitable and the accommodation insufficient for the number of pupils in attendance. 
       A grant for the erection of a new schoolhouse was sanctioned some years ago and a lease of the site executed. The then manager was informed by the Board of Works that he could proceed with the erection of the building, but he was unable to obtain the services of a suitable contractor, and subsequently the erection of the schoolhouse had to be postponed owing to the general restrictions on expenditure on school buildings during the European war. 
       The site is still available, so far as this Department is aware. 
       The present manager has been asked whether he is in a position to proceed with the case.  If a suitable tender be submitted by him this Department will be prepared to consider the question of sanctioning a supplemental grant of two-thirds of the additional expenditure which will be necessary in view of the present cost of building. 
    
    
      
       Assuming the manager does not take any action, or delays in taking action, will the Department take steps to see that action is taken to provide suitable accommodation for those children? 
    
    
      
       When that event arises, if the matter is brought to my attention I will see what can be done. 
    
    
      
       But there is evidence that there is already great delay on the part of somebody in having this work put into operation, and I would like to know whether the Minister has taken any action to speed up matters? 
    
    
      
       I cannot say at the moment, but I will inquire. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - GREATER DUBLIN MOVEMENT. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether it is a fact that the organisation known as the Greater Dublin Movement has been appointed by him to act in an advisory capacity with regard to the Commission which is being set up to consider the problems   of the City and County of Dublin, and if this is not the case whether all bodies interested in the matter will be given equal facilities to lay their views before the Commission. 
    
    
      
       The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  While the Commission will take its own course as to the manner in which its investigations will proceed, I have no doubt that all bodies interested will be given suitable facilities in the submission of evidence. 
    
    
      
       Can the Minister say what is his intention regarding the general question of Local Government? This Commission, as I understand it is suggested, should deal only with Dublin and Dublin County.  There was a suggestion of another Commission to deal with the general question of Local Government.  Can the Minister say anything about that? 
    
    
      
       I do not think that arises out of this question. 
    
    
      
       It is a separate question. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - THE CORK COUNTY SCHEME. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state when it is proposed to lay on the Table of the Dail the Cork County Scheme, pursuant to Section 5 (3) of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923. 
    
    
      
       Copies of the scheme referred to were sent to the Clerk, An Dail, to-day. 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - INSANITARY CONDITION BALLINTUBBER N.S. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if the attention of his Department has been called to the insanitary condition of the Ballintubber National School, County Roscommon, and its immediate surroundings; and, if so whether he will say what steps have been taken or are proposed to be taken to abate the conditions which are alleged   to presently exist, and which would constitute a grave menace to the health of the pupils and teachers and the people of the district in general. 
    
    
      
       No representations on this subject appear to have been made to my Department. 
       If the Deputy will let me know the name of the Dispensary District in which the school is situate, I will call for a report from the local Medical Officer of Health, and I would then have any necessary action taken in the matter. 
    
    
      
       Is it the duty of his Department or of any people in his Department to make periodic inspection of the National Schools and find out what sanitary condition they are in, in view of the danger to public health? 
    
    
      
       I have reiterated very frequently in the Dail that the present administration of public health services, particularly those services dealing with the preventive side of public health, are in a chaotic condition at the present time.  Until I get some legislative measures through, it will be impossible to give the attention to this matter which it deserves. 
    
    
      
       In view of that fact, can the Minister say why the Local Government Bill has been postponed till the Autumn? 
    
    
      
       Principally because of the fact that I understood at the time that the Dail was to adjourn early in July. 
    
    
      
       In view of the change in the programme will the Minister propose to re-introduce the Bill now? 
    
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - THE GLIN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will refer the question of the abolition of the Glin Industrial School to the proposed Commission to be set up in connection with the Local Government Bill, 1924; and   whether he is aware that this school is an inordinate charge on local taxation and gives no adequate return. 
    
    
      
       I do not consider that this matter is one on which the assistance of a Commission would be required. 
       The answer to the latter part of the question is in the negative.  Any representations it is desired to make might be addressed to the Limerick County Board of Health in the first instance.  I have full power at present to take any action necessary, and I am prepared to consider carefully any decision the Board may arrive at. 
    
   
   
     EXTENDED SITTING. 
    
      
       I beg to move: &ldquo;That the Dail sit later than 8.30 p.m. and that the order for the adjournment be taken not later than 10.30.&rdquo; 
       Question put and agreed to. 
    
   
   
     QUESTION OF PROCEDURE. 
     
    
      
       May I ask the President if he can give the Dail some information respecting his proposal for business for this week, particularly as to when he proposes to take the Estimates, and what Estimates, and whether they are to be taken in the order in which they appear on the Orders of the Day? 
    
    
      
       Yes, it is proposed to take the Order Paper in the order in which it is set down.  In the event of not finishing Item 11 to-day, it is proposed to take it as the first business to-morrow.  In the programme I have set out I hope to be able to afford four hours for the Estimates on to-morrow, two hours on Thursday, and three hours on Friday.  That is in anticipation of some of the measures that are down for those days being non-contentious, as I believe they are.  I find that in my statement on Friday I stated that it was intended to introduce eight Bills.  That statement was made out on the day previous, but four Bills were introduced on Friday, so that there remained only four to be introduced then. 
    
    
      
       I have been disappointed in not having had the President's statement circulated, as it was not quite so easy to follow a written statement.  I, for one, rather anticipated the circulation of that statement to the Deputies.  Will the Minister say what is his proposal regarding the motion which is in fact a motion of censure on the Government, which stands in the name of Deputy Milroy, and whether he proposes to shelve the motion of censure, or to allow it to be taken, and also whether it is intended to deal with the other motion on the Order Paper in private Deputies' time on to-morrow? 
    
    
      
       I propose to take the whole of the Deputies' time through the remainder of this session. In connection with Deputy Milroy's motion which, I think, he innocently stated was not in the nature of a motion of condemnation, I propose to give time for its consideration to-morrow.  I would at any time allow time for the discussion of a motion of want of confidence.  In that connection I think the three motions   down for to-morrow will go by the board.  But if a motion were put down as a motion of want of confidence, I would undertake to give time for that to be discussed&mdash;a moderate number of them. 
    
    
      
       Perhaps the President will be more explicit.  Does the President mean that the three motions in my name go by the board. 
    
    
      
       I take it that they are motions in the name of a private Deputy, but I do not interpret them as being motions of want of confidence.  If a motion is tabled as being a motion of want of confidence, I will undertake to give time for its discussion. 
    
    
      
       That raises the matter of the report of the Army Inquiry Committee, which was to be further considered.  I believe that the raising of the matter last Wednesday did not fulfil the President's intention to set aside a day, or part of a day, for the consideration of it.  Is the matter to be considered again, and may we be told if any of these matters raised by Deputy Mulcahy in the three resolutions he has put before us are to come up in their present form, or in any other form before the Dail?  The report itself, the adequate consideration  it, and the dealing with it generally, should take precedence of any motions of that kind. 
    
    
      
       I do not think it is necessary to afford time for considering the report, unless a motion be tabled in connection with it.  I would be prepared to give consideration to the matter when such a motion would be tabled. 
    
    
      
       If the President is of opinion that the motions standing in my name are not motions of want of confidence, I am prepared to make them more explicit.  I do feel that the action of the Executive Council with regard to those three officers, and their subsequent inaction after the Army Inquiry Committee report was submitted, are matters that very gravely affect our confidence in the Executive Council. 
    
     
    
      
       I propose to give time for any motion of want of confidence. 
    
    
      
       In the event of a motion for want of confidence being put down, will the President give it priority over other business?  Such a motion should not be put down and discussed at a late hour in a tired House. 
    
    
      
       I will consider that. 
    
    
      
       Will I have the assistance of any draftsman I want in making my motion plainly to show that it is a motion of want of confidence? 
    
    
      
       The General is entitled to that. 
    
    
      
       Perhaps if Deputy Mulcahy consulted with the Clerk he might be able to give him some assistance.  The position about private members' business is that Deputy Milroy's motion and the amendment will arise in private members' time to-morrow. 
       Agreed. 
    
   
   
     PRIVATE BUSINESS. - SLIGO LIGHTING AND ELECTRIC POWER BILL, 1924&mdash;REPORT STAGE. 
    
      
       I beg to propose that the Sligo Lighting and Electric Power Bill, 1924, be received for final consideration.  This Bill was an unopposed Bill from the Seanad, and the report of the Joint Committee in connection with the measure has been laid on the Table. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
    
   
   
     PUBLIC BUSINESS. - DAMAGE TO PROPERTY (COMPENSATION) (AMENDMENT) BILL, 1924&mdash;(SECOND STAGE). 
    
      
       The Damage to Property Act provided that in a case where the judge gave an award, that is a case coming under Section 13, the Minister for Finance should have power to   create, by order, certain securities and to use these securities for the purpose of paying in certain proportions the person who had received the award.  In the case of what are called wrongful acts, which consist mainly in the destruction of bank or Government notes or paper currency of any kind, and secondly, the taking away of chattels, without the consent of the owner, the judge was not empowered to give an award.  He was authorised to investigate the case and to report to the Minister for Finance in writing, amongst other things, the sum which would fairly compensate the owner for such loss.  It would be possible to pay these report cases in cash when a vote had been taken in the Dail, but it would not be possible, without an Act of this sort, to pay in securities.  It does not seem to us that it is desirable that the report cases should be in a more favourable position than the decree cases.  We propose, therefore, by this Act to take power to issue in payment of report cases, the securities issued under the order made under Section 13, primarily where there are awards or decrees. 
       Bill read a Second Time.  Committee Stage ordered for Friday, June 27th. 
    
   
   
     COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - MONEY RESOLUTION&mdash;DEFENCE FORCES (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT, 1923 (CONTINUATION AND AMENDMENT) BILL, 1924. 
    
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Go bhfuil se oiriunach a udaru go n-iocfar amach as airgead a sholathroidh an tOireachtas as tSioson so chun bunau agus leasu do dheanamh ar an Acht Forsai Cosanta (Foralacha Sealadacha), 1923, le n-a socruitear i gcoir Shaorstait Eireann agus i gcoir nithe eile a bhaineas leis sin. 
    
     That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses incurred under any Act of the present Session to continue and amend the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, which   provides for the defence of Saorstat Eireann and other matters incidental thereto. 
     The Defence Forces Bill is merely a Continuation Bill, and it does not authorise any new charges other than those which were incurred under the existing legislation. 
     Resolution put and agreed to. 
   
   
     COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - DAIL RESUMES. 
     Resolution reported. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dail do agree with the Committee in the said Resolution&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - DEFENCE FORCES (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT, 1923 (CONTINUANCE AND AMENDMENT) BILL, 1924&mdash;THIRD STAGE. 
     Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 put and agreed to. 
     SECTION 7. 
     Section 10 of the Principal Act (which relates to the granting of commissions) shall be and is hereby amended by the addition thereto of the following sub-section:&mdash; 
     &ldquo;(2)  Where a person holding appointment as an officer in the National Forces at the date of the Proclamation mentioned in Section 22 of this Act is appointed to commissioned rank in the Forces, such person may, be in the event of his failing to pass the qualifying tests prescribed for the rank mentioned in his commission, be reduced by the Minister from that rank to the highest commissioned rank for which he passes the prescribed qualifying tests.&rdquo; 
    
      
       I would like the President to explain what exactly will be the position when this section is passed.  Under Section 18 of the original Act it is provided, that from and after five years following upon the establishment of a military college under the Act preference in appointment to commissioned rank in the Forces shall, as far as possible, be given to graduates of that college.  It   is not clear as to whether this section is to come into operation before the termination of those five years.  I wonder could the President explain the position with regard to examinations for appointment of officers at the present time. 
    
    
      
       The Defence Forces are at present maintained under the transitory provisions of the Act passed last year.  As soon as the present Bill becomes law, it is intended to establish the Forces by means of a proclamation issued by the Executive Council under Section 22 of the Act. When that proclamation is published commissions will be issued to officers in the form laid down in the First Schedule. It is proposed then that all officers should go through a military school and pass the qualifying tests.  In the event of an officer not passing the test, unless this provision were in, the only alternative left was to demobilise that officer, but it is proposed by means of this particular section to afford him an opportunity of qualifying for the rank immediately under that to which he was commissioned. 
    
    
      
       I imagine it will take a very long time for this to work out, as you cannot put all the officers through this course for several years. 
    
    
      
       It is hoped, in the way I have mentioned, that we should be able to pass all the officers in the Army through during twelve months. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 7 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Section 8 agreed to and added to the Bill. 
       SECTION 9. 
       The form of oath or declaration to be taken or made pursuant to Section 21 of the Principal Act shall be as follows in lieu of the form of oath or declaration set out in the Second Schedule to the Principal Act, that is to say:&mdash; 
    
     &ldquo;I,, do solemnly swear (or declare) that I have this day freely and voluntarily enlisted as a soldier in Oglaigh na hEireann; that I will faithfully serve as such for the period of  , from theday of, 19(unless sooner discharged by proper authority) and under the conditions prescribed in accordance with law; and I will accept such pay, bounty, rations and clothing as may from time to time be prescribed in accordance with law. 
     And I do further solemnly swear (or declare) that I will bear true faith and allegiance to, and against all enemies whomsoever, defend, Saorstat Eireann and its Constitution as by law established and I will render good and true service and obedience to the Oireachtas and Government of Saorstat Eireann under the Constitution, and that I will submit myself to discipline and obey without question the orders of the officers appointed over me according to law, and further that I will not while I am a soldier in Oglaigh na hEireann join, or be a member of, or subscribe to, any political society or organisation whatsoever or any secret society whatsoever.&rdquo; 
    
      
       On the last day, I think, Deputy Nagle asked a question on this section.  He asked what was the reason for the difference between the oath that an officer takes and the oath an ordinary private soldier takes.  Different forms are prescribed, because in the case of an officer his position is analogous to that of a Civil Servant. He holds his commission during the pleasure of the Executive Council, and there is no contract between him and the State.  The soldier is enlisted, and enlistment, in that sense, is the acceptance of an engagement in the military service of the State, and it is in the nature of a contract between the person enlisted and the State. 
    
    
      
       Will the Minister explain a little further what are the terms of that contract?  Is there to be a stated reward on the one part&mdash;payment for the services rendered, and what is that payment?  I notice by the form of the oath that the soldier is to swear, &ldquo;I will accept such pay, bounty, rations and clothing as may from time to time be prescribed.&rdquo;  Is   is suggested that the contract is one which may be varied at will by one party to the contract without reference to the other party, and if it is a contract, is it not within the terms of the contract or the general equities of the case that when a change is made in the conditions under which the contract is fulfilled, that either party may withdraw from it?  I notice, if we take the next section, Section 10, we find there that an officer who declines or neglects to take the oath prescribed for him, is deemed to have resigned his commission. There is no such suggestion in reference to the oath to be taken by soldiers.  I am still in a difficulty to reconcile the distinction, if the distinction is as the Minister, has now stated, that in the one case it is a contract.  I am anxious to know why the terms of the contract are not made known to one of the parties.  When they vary one of the parties to the contract may decline to accept the variation. 
    
    
      
       The mode of enlistment and the attestation are set out in Section 148 of the Act.  It is not proposed to vary the contract unless where it is so specified, in such cases, say, as ration allowances or things of that sort in which it would be inadvisable, I think, to set up a regular and rigid standard.  In the case of a soldier, he understands on his attestation or enlistment, how he stands exactly. It is before him, and he has the particulars of it.  In the case of officers it is not the same at all, because we have them already.  It is not in contemplation at present to issue commissions to men other than those we have at present in the Army, and in their case, unless they take the oath which is in addition to the Act of last year, then they will be deemed to have been demobilised or to have resigned in that time. 
    
    
      
       The Minister is merely re-stating the position which he has already given to the Dail.  I am rather asking why the distinction should be made.  You have soldiers and officers at present in the Army. You are proposing new legislation which changes the terms of the oath in both cases.  In the one case an officer who declines or neglects to take the oath is deemed to have resigned, but in the other case there is no option, or   may we take it, that in both cases neglect to take the oath will mean freedom to demobilise oneself.  A soldier may demobilise himself by neglecting to take the oath.  Is that, I ask, the position? Further, on the question of the distinction between the term of service, the Minister states that in the case of a soldier it is a contract of service, and that it is not proposed, he says, to vary the conditions.  That, I suggest, does not affect the case.  The Minister may not propose it, but his successor may.  I want to know, supposing the Minister's successor proposes to change the terms of service, which apparently he is entitled to do, without reference to the soldier, when a contract has been entered into, the soldier must be deemed to have been aware of the terms of that contract, and if a variation takes place during the terms of service, then may we take it that the contract has been broken on the side of the State, and that the soldier is no longer bound by this contract. 
    
    
      
       The soldier's enlistment is not completed until he has taken the oath, and the fact of his enlistment or, at least, the mode of the attestation, is set out in Section 148. On the other hand, Section 148 does not exhaust it.  If you look at Section 149 it is found that the soldier may, as it were, buy himself out.  In the case of the officers, who are at present in the Army, it is proposed to issue commissions to them.  Properly speaking, they have not got these commissions at present, although gazetted to commissioned ranks.  As soon as the Act is passed it is proposed to issue a proclamation by the Executive Council, and these commissions will be issued, and it is necessary for the officers to take the oath.  In the case of the men, it is necessary to do it before enlistment, and they are not enlisted until they have taken the oath. 
    
    
      
       Then are we to understand that those who are at present serving are not in the Army, and that they are not enlisted and not bound? 
    
    
      
       Yes, they are in it and they are bound to it, but a man, as I said, is not completely enlisted until he has taken the oath.  In the case   of the officers, they are under the transitory provision of the Act of last year, and it is proposed to regularise that Act now. 
    
    
      
       Are we to understand that in the case of all the existing officers in the Army they have not taken any oath or made any declarations that would prevent them belonging to some secret political society? There is no obligation at present binding them to make any declaration of that kind? 
    
    
      
       No. 
    
    
      
       There is one question that I would like to ask; it is on a matter of variation.  Can the President now say if the order made, I think, last October, or about that date, to the effect that men serving in the National Army who get married would not be entitled to separation allowance for their wives,, has been varied?  It has caused a lot of dissatisfaction in the Army.  The President promised some time ago to have the matter reconsidered, and I would like to know if it has been reconsidered and what has been the decision? 
    
    
      
       I believe that the Order stands, but the matter is under consideration by the Army Pay Commission, and is not yet settled.  I expect I may be able to announce before the Bill passes its final stage what action is taken in that respect. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 9 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Sections 10 to 23 inclusive were agreed to and added to the Bill. 
       SECTION 24. 
       Section 84 of the Principal Act (which relates to the investigation of a charge against an officer) shall be and is hereby amended as follows:&mdash; 
       (a) At the end of sub-section (1) there shall be added the following words&mdash;&ldquo;or by some other officer appointed in that behalf by the Adjutant-General.&rdquo; 
    
     (b)  The words &ldquo;officer investigating the charge&rdquo; shall be substituted for the words &ldquo;commanding   officer&rdquo; where the same occur in sub-sections (2) and (3). 
     (c)  The following sub-paragraph shall be substituted for sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of Sub-section 4:&mdash; 
     &ldquo;(ii)  If he considers the case is one which should be dealt with summarily he shall, where the finding involves an automatic forfeiture of pay under paragraph (a) of Section 127 of this Act, or where he proposes to award a fine, first ask the officer charged whether he desires to be dealt with summarily or to be tried by court martial, and if the officer elects to be tried by court martial he shall remand him for trial by court martial, but otherwise shall proceed to deal summarily with the case.&rdquo; 
    
      
       I would like to ask the President if he could give us any information as to why any change should have been required in the principal Act in connection with these matters of punishment and courtsmartial, and so on.  A little information as to why within the last year and for a period of only a very few months, it is required to make these very considerable changes should be given to the House and would, I think, help us to understand perhaps, what we are doing. 
    
    
      
       In Clause 21 the maximum fine is reduced from £5 to £3; that might have been imposed on a summary conviction by a commanding officer, and the fine is reduced.  The prescribed officer who, it is intended will be a G.O.C., can reduce or remit the punishment awarded by a Commanding Officer.  In cases of rates of pay, the accused has a right to elect to be tried by courtmartial.  In the case of Section 22, Section 82 of the Act provides for the punishment which may be awarded to a private soldier by a Commanding Officer, and practically the same provisions are made&mdash;that is, the reduction of the fine, and so on, are provided for.  Now, as regards Section 23, Section 83 of the Act provides for the punishment which may be summarily awarded to a private soldier by a Company Commander.  This clause is a result of the change in the organisation   of the Army, and also is a result of the experience gained in working of the disciplinary code in the Army for the last 12 months.  The Army, as reorganised, does not provide for a Commanding Officer and a Company Commander for each unit.  Experience has shown that it is desirable that the Commanding Officer should be ordinarily the proper person to investigate a charge against a soldier.  Provision is made by Clause 27 enabling Commanding Officers in certain cases to delegate powers of summarily disposing of cases to officers serving under them. 
       Section 24 deals with Section 84, which provides for the manner in which a charge against an officer is to be investigated. This section re-enacts that, with certain modifications&mdash;that is, such a case as that in which a commanding officer himself might be the person charged.  Paragraph (b) is consequential on the previous paragraph, and (c) introduces the accused's right to elect to be tried by court-martial in cases where an award or punishment would affect pay.  Generally speaking, most of these amendments have been made as a result of experience which we have gained during the last twelve months. 
       Sections 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32, put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 33. 
       The following section shall be inserted in the Principal Act after Section 116 thereof:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;116a.&mdash;Where a finding of a courtmartial has been confirmed, the Minister may quash such finding.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Under the rules of procedure there is power to remit sentences, when confirmed, but there is no power to quash the finding, which still remains on record as a conviction against an officer or soldier, and this section authorises the Minister for Defence to quash a finding after confirmation. 
       Sections 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43, put and agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Preamble stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
    
     
        Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Title stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - THE DAIL RESUMES. 
     Bill reported without amendment. 
    
      
       When will the next stage be taken? 
    
    
      
       Before passing, I would like to ask the Minister to consider the position of the soldiers under this Bill for the period preparatory to the bringing forward of a new permanent measure.  The Minister has said that these amendments have been found necessary in consequence of the experience of the last twelve months. Now, inasmuch as the law relating to the Defence Forces is the law relating to soldiers in the Army, one would naturally expect that the experiences those soldiers themselves gained should have something to say to the permanent measure which will govern the conduct of the Army.  The experiences of the Headquarters Staff may be one thing, the experiences of the soldiers themselves will be quite another, and it seems to me that the interim between now and the permanent measure should be availed of to enable the soldiers themselves to give expression in some way to what they consider unjust or unfair or impracticable in the conduct of the service so far as they are concerned, and more particularly when it comes to the question of discipline and disciplinary measures, punishments and the like.  Soldiers are precluded under the terms of their declaration, or oath, from subscribing to or becoming members of any political society or organisation whatsoever, and I want it to be made clear by the Minister himself that that does not preclude soldiers from expressing their views upon what is requisite to the proper conduct of the Military Forces, in so far as the law affecting soldiers is concerned.  If we are to understand how a measure of this kind affects a soldier, then that soldier must be free to express his dissatisfaction, or his sense of injustice, or to make suggestions as to alterations of the law, which, in fact, is a political effort. 
    
     I invite the Minister to make distinct   here that when we say a soldier is not to be a member of or to subscribe to any political society or organisation whatsoever, that that does not preclude him, or any number of soldiers, from making representations in regard to a political measure, such as the Defence Forces Bill, and that it will not be deemed to be insubordination for soldiers to make representation regarding the terms of the Act under which they are working and living.  There must be, I think, and there ought to be, some means whereby the legislature should be made aware of the soldiers' grievances, and if they are precluded by virtue of any oath or regulation from making representations in regard to the incidence of Acts of Parliament, then they are practically helpless things in a machine.  I suggest to the Minister that he should make it clear to the Army, to those at least who are likely to continue to serve, who are not likely to be demobilised in the next month or two, that their experiences of the disciplinary terms and conditions under which they are working should be given expression to if they desire, so that when we come to deal with a permanent measure we shall have not only the views of the Headquarters Staff and the Ministry itself, but also the people who are obliged to obey the rules laid down and the conditions prescribed by the law.  I think that it must be understood that this measure, as the last measure, the Principal Act, as it is called, is temporary, and that the permanent Act will have to receive very much more careful consideration from the Oireachtas.  In giving it that consideration we ought to have knowledge of the experience, not only of the Headquarters, but of the rank and file of the Army. 
    
      
       Will not this question arise rather on the next Stage of the Bill than now?  We have finished one Stage, and the question is when are we going to take the next. On the next Stage the general question of the Bill, it would arise. 
    
    
      
       I want to ask a question. 
    
     
    
      
       The Deputy has had forty-three opportunities of doing so. 
    
    
      
       I thought at the end of the Bill was the proper place to ask a question. 
    
    
      
       I will allow the Deputy to ask the question. 
    
    
      
       On Friday last the President made a promise that he would circulate a White Paper in connection with the Army reorganisation scheme, and I want to know when that paper will be circulated, so that we will have an opportunity of discussing it. 
    
    
      
       I understood I gave an undertaking that when the Army Estimate would come up it could be raised, and it was on that occasion I intended to afford the opportunity. 
    
    
      
       The answer to the question did not state so. 
    
    
      
       That was the impression I intended to convey. 
    
    
      
       Can the President be sure that the Army Estimates will not come on to-day?  They are on the Order Paper.  Will he give an undertaking that they will not be taken, and that they will not be discussed until we get this White Paper? 
    
    
      
       I think I will be safe in giving an undertaking that the Army Estimates will not come on to-day. 
    
    
      
       Will the President give an undertaking that the scheme will not be brought into operation until we have an opportunity of discussing the matter? 
    
    
      
       I am afraid I could not give that undertaking. 
    
    
      
       Has the scheme not already been put into operation? 
    
    
      
       I am afraid we are getting into a new matter now.  The question is the fixing of the Report Stage. 
       Report Stage ordered for Tuesday, 2nd July. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - FINANCE BILL, 1924&mdash;REPORT STAGE. 
     
    
      
       I have put down two amendments.  I move:&mdash; 
       1. To insert before Section 9, page 9, a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       (1)  If any person who has paid tax charged under an assessment to income tax made for any year under Schedule D, or according to the Rules applicable to that Schedule, alleges that the assessment was excessive by reason of some error or mistake in the return or statement made by him for the purposes of the assessment, he may, at any time not later than three years after the end of the year of assessment within which the assessment was made, make an application in writing to the Revenue Commissioners for relief. 
       (2)  On receiving any such application the Revenue Commissioners shall inquire into the matter and shall, subject to the provisions of this section, give by way of repayment such relief (including any consequential relief from super-tax) in respect of the error or mistake as is reasonable and just: 
       Provided that no relief shall be given under this section in respect of an error or mistake as to the basis on which the liability of the applicant ought to have been computed where the return or statement was in fact made on the basis or in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the time when the return or statement was made. 
       (3)  In determining any application under this section the Revenue Commissioners shall have regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case, and in particular shall consider whether the granting of relief would result in the exclusion from charge to income tax or super-tax of any part of the profits or income of the applicant, and for this purpose the Commissioners may take into consideration the liability of the applicant and assessments made on him in respect of other years. 
    
     
        (4)  Any person who is aggrieved by the determination of the Revenue Commissioners on an application made by him under this section may, on giving notice in writing to those Commissioners within twenty-one days after the notification to him of their determination, appeal to the Special Commissioners. 
     (5) The Special Commissioners shall thereupon hear and determine the appeal in accordance with the principles to be followed by the Revenue Commissioners in determining applications under this section, and subject thereto, in like manner as in the case of an appeal to them against an assessment under Schedule D, and the provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to such an appeal (including the provisions relating to the statement of a case of the opinion of the High Court on a point of law) shall apply accordingly with the necessary modifications: 
     Provided that neither the appellant nor the Revenue Commissioners shall be entitled to require a case to be stated for the opinion of the High Court otherwise than on a point of law arising in connection with the computation of profits or income. 
     The object of this proposal is to bring the Finance Bill into conformity with the Finance Act that exists in England.  The position under the Bill is this, that where an assessment is made under Schedule D, if an appeal be not lodged against that assessment within 21 days, the assessment becomes final.  Under Section 24 of the British Act, any taxpayer&mdash;and if this amendment is passed we will have the same privileges here&mdash;can reclaim any tax paid through error, or from any other causes in making his return.  It is hardly necessary in these days in this country to point out the reasonableness of such a provision as is now proposed.  Many people on whom these assessments were made have left the country.  In other cases our postal arrangements are not exactly in an ideal state.  One might cite many reasons why it is very undesirable that   where an appeal against an assessment should be made within twenty-one days, that, in the circumstances I have pointed out, it would be quite unfair to enforce these conditions, and for that reason I propose that this additional section should be added.  It will put the income taxpayer in the Free State in exactly the same position as the income taxpayer is in England, where the same conditions that I have cited do not prevail. 
    
      
       I second. 
    
    
      
       This amendment is, I think, a copy of Section 24 of the British Finance Act of last year, with the substitution of the words &ldquo;Revenue Commissioners&rdquo; for &ldquo;Commissioners of Inland Revenue.&rdquo;  It is one of two sections in that Act.  One section gives certain additional powers to the Revenue, and another gives certain additional privileges to the taxpayer. Deputy Good has proposed a section which gives certain privileges to the taxpayer.  It has been the practice for a good many years past to repay the taxpayer any tax overpaid by him in error, and the section will only give him as a legal right what he has got in practice in the past.  There are, however, one or two slight emendations which, I think, would be necessary.  As we do not propose, at present at any rate, to take the additional powers for recovery of penalties which were taken by the British in the Act of 1923, I do not think that it is desirable that we should give what may be in some cases six years for the making of the application. Then, as the law stands at present, if this amendment were passed, we would give an additional appeal in this case beyond the appeal in England.  We would give an appeal not merely to the Commissioners but to the Circuit Court.  In these matters of errors I do not think it is necessary that we should have an appeal to the Circuit Court, and have the litigation and delays that are likely to rise.  If Deputy Good would accept a couple of small emendations which I would suggest, I will be prepared to take the amendment. 
    
     I would ask Deputy Good to insert   the word &ldquo;for&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;within&rdquo; in the third last line of paragraph 1, so that it would read: &ldquo;he may, at any time, not later than three years after the end of the year of assessment for which the assessment was made, make an application in writing to the Revenue Commissioners for relief.&rdquo;  In the brackets in paragraph 5, I suggest the insertion of the words &ldquo;but excluding the provisions of Section 196 of the Income Tax Act of 1918,&rdquo; so that it would read &ldquo;(including the provisions relating to the statement of a case of the opinion of the High Court on a point of law, but excluding the provisions of Section 196 of the Income Tax Act of 1918).&rdquo;  If these words were inserted the position in regard to appeals would be the same as in England.  If they were not inserted there would be an appeal to the Circuit Court, for where there is no parallel in England. 
    
      
       I will be glad to accept the amendment to the new section. 
    
    
      
       Has the Minister noticed the necessity for the change of the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; to &ldquo;for&rdquo; in that, so as to make it read &ldquo;for the opinion of the High Court&rdquo;? 
    
    
      
       Yes; that is a slip and should be made right. 
       Leave to amend the new section granted. 
       New section, as amended, put and agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       To insert before section 9, page 9, a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       (1)  Section forty-one of the Income Tax Act, 1918, and Rule 5 of No. V. of Schedule A. (which fix the period within which certain claims for repayment of income tax may be made) shall, so far as relates to claims for repayment in respect of income tax charged for the year 1921-22 or for any subsequent year of assessment, have effect as though a period of six years after the expiration of the year of assessment were substituted for a period of three years after the expiration of the year of assessment. 
    
     (2)  Section twenty-five of the Income Tax Act, 1918 (which grants relief from tax in respect of income   accumulated under trusts) shall, in case of such a contingency as is referred to in that section happening in the year 1921-22 or in any subsequent year of assessment, have effect as though a period of six years after the end of the year of assessment in which the contingency happens were substituted for a period of three years after the end of the year of assessment in which the contingency happens. 
     (3)  Any provision of the Income Tax Acts which authorises a claim for repayment of income tax to be made at the end of any year of assessment or within a specified period of less than one year after the end of any year of assessment shall be amended so as to authorise the making of the claim within a period of one year after the end of the year of assessment. 
     This proposed new section extends the time for making claims for refunds under the Income Tax Act to six years beginning with the year 1920-21.  The period at the moment is three years. This will bring the Free State Finance Act into conformity with the Finance Act of 1923 which is in existence in Great Britain at the moment.  One might also mention incidentally that the period of six years within which one can make claims is also the period fixed by the Statute of Limitations. 
    
      
       I must resist this proposed new section, because, even more than in the previous case, this is only part of the change which was made in Great Britain.  There were two sections inserted together in the British Finance Act of 1923.  Section 29, which extended from 3 to 6 years the time within which additional assessments or surcharges for 1920-21, or any subsequent year, could be made by the Revenue; and Section 30, which extended the time within which the taxpayer might claim repayment from 3 to 6 years.  This matter was considered by us, and we decided that we could not this year, at any rate, introduce the changes here that were introduced in Great Britain.  The income tax staff here is so heavily worked, from the point of view of dealing with arrears already in existence, that it would be   impossible for them to make use of additional powers such as were taken for the Revenue under Section 29 of the British Act.  Then there is the additional reason that we do not wish to go back now on matters prior to 1922-23, when we took over the income tax collection. If we adopted this proposal it would mean that we would give the taxpayers six years for reclaiming without giving the revenue 6 years in which to make additional assessments or surcharges. We think that if a change is being made the two changes should come about together.  There is another reason.  If this change were made it would automatically involve us in making repayments to taxpayers who had paid to the British, so that, as a matter of fact, we would be repaying money which we had never received.  I do not think that this is particularly desirable. We are inclined to think that a change such as this might be made, and I think that the Deputy may take it that in a subsequent Finance Bill this provision, with the countervailing provision giving the Revenue authorities their 6 years, will be included. 
    
    
      
       On the whole, I think the explanation of the Minister is only fair.  To give the privilege to one side, and not extend the same privilege to the Executive, would be unfair.  I think the Minister would be well advised in a few years to try, as far as possible, and keep the taxpayer, from the point of view of privileges in the Free State on the same terms as the taxpayer in Great Britain.  We are anxious that many of those who, owing to high rates of income tax and other reasons, have left the Free State, in many cases taking considerable amount of capital with them, should be encouraged to return and give the advantage of that capital to the Free State.  From that and other points of view I urge that it would be exceedingly desirable in future Finance Bills that the Minister should, as far as possible, in matters of this kind, endeavour to have the Acts prevailing in the two countries as nearly alike as possible. In view of what the Minister has said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
    
     
    
      
       I beg to move: 
       In Section 15 (2), page 8, line 25, to delete the words &ldquo;not contained in bottles&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;imported in sealed tins or cans.&rdquo; 
       This amendment states the matter in a positive rather than in a negative way, and also avoids difficulties which might arise as regards the question, whether a particular vessel was a bottle or a jar. 
    
    
      
       I think this form is much better, and I approve of it. 
    
    
      
       May I congratulate the Minister on having adopted the words of my amendment, but may I express my regret that he has not adopted the substance of it by letting these fruits in sealed tins and cans in free of duty altogether.  May I also call attention to the fact that there are not 20 Deputies present. 
       A count having been taken: 
    
    
      
       There are 20 Deputies present, including myself. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move: 
       In Section 18, page 9, line 5, after the word &ldquo;candles&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;tapers and nightlights.&rdquo; 
       This amendment is proposed by way of preventing litigious persons from raising questions.  The word &ldquo;taper&rdquo; is applied very frequently to small, coloured candles.  They are called Christmas tapers, on which the Revenue Commissioners will be bound to charge duty.  Of course the Revenue Commissioners would regard night-lights as candles of a small size and shape. 
    
     
    
      
       Litigious persons might raise the question that night-lights might include electric lights or any other sort but wax or fat.  I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider that term.  Night-lights, I think, is too general a term to cover candles, or something appertaining to candles. 
    
    
      
       If the Ceann Comhairle will allow me, I will make it &ldquo;candles, including tapers and night-lights.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I think Deputy Johnson has raised a point of substance. The term &ldquo;electric candle&rdquo; is quite common in the trade. 
    
    
      
       I think we can leave that to the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners. 
       Leave to amend the amendment granted. 
       Amendment, as amended, agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I move: 
       In the Fourth Schedule, page 17, at the beginning of the second column, to delete the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; where it first occurs in the expression &ldquo;Finance Act (1909-10) Act, 1910.&rdquo; 
       Amendment agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I move: 
       In the Fourth Schedule at the beginning of the Schedule (i.e., before the words relating to the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910) to insert the following:&mdash; 
    
     
       
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
           
             16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 107 
             Customs Consolidation Act, 1853. 
             Sections 114 and 115 
           
         
         
           
             25 Vict. c. 22 
             Revenue Act, 1862 
             Sections 27 to 37 and so much of Schedule C as relates to playing cards. 
           
           
             54 &amp; 55 Vict. c. 38 
             Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891. 
             In section 26, the words &ldquo;or playing cards.&rdquo; 
           
           
             8 Edw. VII. c. 16 
             Finance Act, 1908 
             In sub-section (4) of section 4, the words &ldquo;and playing cards.&rdquo; 
           
         
       
     
     These are the new repeals relating to playing-cards.  Sections 114 and 115 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1853, relate to the obligation to import playing-cards in wrappers.  That was necessary when there was an Excise Duty which was collected by means of the wrapping on home-made playing-cards.   The others are various sections in which there are provisions in relation to playing-cards. 
     Amendment agreed to. 
     
    
      
       I beg to move: 
       Fourth Schedule to delete the following words and figures:&mdash; 
    
     
       
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
           
             10 &amp; 11 Geo. V. c. 18 
             Finance Act, 1920 
             Paragraph (e) of sub-section (2) of section 53. 
           
         
       
     
     This was a repeal which went in by accident.  It should not have been included. 
     Amendment agreed to. 
    
      
       I beg to move: 
       Fourth Schedule in the third column, opposite the expression &ldquo;Finance Act, 1921,&rdquo; to delete the word and figures &ldquo;Section 29&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words and figures &ldquo;Sections 13 and 29.&rdquo; 
       This is another section dealing with playing cards.  In the Schedule, Section 29 is an Income Tax section.  Section 13 is a section which provides for the warehousing of home-made playing cards intended for export.  As the Excise Duty is removed there is no need for the section now. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Motion made:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill, as amended, be received for final consideration.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       Perhaps I will be permitted to say a few words arising out of Deputy Good's remarks.  He has suggested that it should be the policy of the Minister for Finance to approximate the finance schemes of the Free State to that of Great Britain&mdash;in effect, to make of no value the fiscal freedom that we have to develop on our own lines.  If it is to be the policy that Ministers for Finance should make their finance schemes fit in with those of Great Britain, I would suggest to the Minister that it should be rather the contrary, that we should not adopt a finance scheme and make it conform to that of Great Britain, but rather to a very great extent be the opposite to it.  The present scheme is mainly a carry-over scheme from the British scheme. 
       The result of it is to impose on the mass of the people as consumers a disproportionate share of the burden of running the State.  The effect of that is that the consumers of the ordinary, common necessaries of life as such are made to bear this disproportionate burden, notwithsanding the pleas made on behalf of income tax payers, notwithstanding what one may speak of as the bitter cry of the income tax payer.  The fact that the poor man and woman who do not pay income tax are taxed upon the necessaries and common luxuries makes them bear an undue burden of taxation.  I suggest to the Minister that the whole plan of the Bill is wrong and should not be continued any longer than is necessary, that so far from carrying over the taxes on sugar and tea and other necessaries which are all imported, it would be better for the State to reduce the taxation on those articles which are not produced at home, and transfer those taxes upon imports, so long as taxes upon imports continue, to articles of the kind that may be produced in this country.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look around for other methods of financing the State, and in taking into account the imposition of taxes for services which are at present rendered, he ought also take into account services that ought to be rendered and are not.  This, no doubt, would cost money, or possibly might cost money, but it would either immediately or eventually become beneficial and of advantage in wealth production to the community. 
    
     I dissent from the general scheme of this Bill, and would more especially dissent from it if I thought it were likely to be the basis of continued legislation with regard to finance, because it is following out a plan which was adopted by Britain, an industrial country living on the export of manufactured goods and depending for its existence upon the importation of foreign-grown food stuffs.  We in this country have entirely different economic conditions and, therefore, I submit we should have a different system   of taxation and that the taxation scheme should be fitted in, not merely to make it comparatively easy for the Finance Department to rake in money, but should also be designed for the purpose of enlarging the area of cultivation and generally promoting the production of commodities which are consumable and exchangeable within, and outside, this country.  I submit that the scheme of finance ought to have regard, to a very much greater extent than this Bill has, to its re-action in the field of production and it should also differ entirely and utterly from the ideas expressed by Deputy Good. We should rather go counter to the schemes of finance and the raising of revenue that have been adopted in Great Britain.  This cannot be done this year and, no doubt, the Bill will pass without any further comments or alterations, but for fear the Minister is unduly impressed by the arguments of Deputy Good I want to put in the other side of the case. 
    
      
       I do not think that there is the least fear of the Minister being unduly influenced by any remark of mine, but I am influenced by a suggestion which has fallen from Deputy Johnson, who urges, seeing that Great Britain is going in one direction, that it ought to be the policy of those in charge of the finances of the Free State to go in the other direction.  If that means that while Great Britain is maintaining a high rate of income tax at a war level, which is very inadvisable in times of peace, and if Deputy Johnson means that we should go in the opposite direction and get the income tax back to what it ought to be, instead of being on a war rate level, there is no difference whatever between Deputy Johnson and myself, and I heartily support his proposal.  In this question of taxation and the burden of taxation I urge that at least the taxpayer in the Free State should not be put at any disadvantage as compared with the taxpayer in Great Britain.  The reasons why I urge that as a policy are obvious. 
    
     During the last few years the Free State has lost a considerable number of its old citizens as well as a considerable amount of capital.  That is a distinct   disadvantage to the Free State, and I therefore urge, in putting forward these economies, that we should do everything we possibly can to attract back to this country those persons with capital who have left, and everything that places the taxpayer in the Free State at a disadvantage, as compared with the taxpayer in Great Britain, adds to the difficulty of getting those persons and that capital back to the Free State.  One does not want to go into all the grievances from which we suffer, such as high income tax, high postal rates, and high charges of one kind or another which do not exist on the other side to the same extent.  The only attraction at all which the Minister for Finance holds out to those possessed of capital and who left this country, in order that they might come back to the Free State, is a reduction in death duties.  I do not know whether that reduction will be looked upon as a very attractive one on the other side, because my idea is that where people live they generally die, and if he cannot attract them to live in the Free State, I do not think that we will attract them to die here by a reduction of death duties. 
    
      
       I am never surprised by Deputy Johnson, but I got nearer to it this afternoon than I normally get, because his speech was more divorced from reality than is customary with him.  I expected him to complain, not that we were following Great Britain too closely, but that we did not follow the present Chancellor of the Exchequer closely enough.  I expected him to ask the Minister for Finance for a reduction in the sugar and tea duties, further than that which has been given, and a reduction on other items which have been taxed, but Deputy Johnson did not take that line. I want to know exactly on which leg Deputy Johnson stands.  Does he believe in increasing direct taxation? Is that his policy, because if so, it is and has been the British policy?  The thing that differentiates British financial policy from that of other countries is the fact that they introduced income tax at an earlier date, and collected it on a very much higher scale than any continental country.  The continental   countries relied on high prices and indirect taxation, while the British, on the other hand, introduced the income tax. 
       Deputy Johnson does not wish income tax to be done away with, and at the same time wishes to get away from the direct system, the British system, which is an income tax system. Take France, for example.  The system of taxation is indirect, and is largely avoided.  The same thing holds in Italy.  The way money is raised there is by high taxes.  As Deputy Johnson knows, and certainly Deputy Davin knows, you cannot leave the station, at Paris, Milan, or Rome without a man at the gate asking you if you are bringing in any foodstuffs.  That is for the purpose of the municipal  octroi , the tax on the import of any foodstuffs. That raises the cost of living for the poor.  Is that Deputy Johnson's policy?  Are we to get away from the income tax and follow that un-British policy?  There was one respect in which I would ask the Minister to follow the French financial policy. At present, if an American visitor takes a house here, tax is levied on the whole of his income if he remains over a certain time.  In France that policy is not followed.  He is taxed with the income he apparently spends in the country on the valuation of his villa and on the income he appears to enjoy.  If he lives in a modest way the tax is a moderate tax, but it is helpful to the Revenue.  If the Minister would, in considering his budget for next year, see the wisdom of making reductions on those lines, the visitors to the Tailteann games might be persuaded to return, and settle here for a longer period.  Or is Deputy Johnson's other alternative that this country should follow the United States? 
    
     I have heard it put forward by men whose opinion I value, that the policy of this country should be that of the United States&mdash;high import duties, high prices and high wages.  I am sure from what I can now remember of the Governor-General's speech&mdash;it is a long time ago since I read it&mdash;that that is not the policy of the Government.  Is that Deputy Johnson's policy, and is that the horse he declares to win on?   If so, I would ask him to bear in mind the difference between a Continent largely undeveloped, with huge mineral resources, and a somewhat over-populated island, which has at present very little resources beyond that of agriculture, backed by a little distilling and brewing.  Until our conditions are better, it is impossible to adopt a policy of that kind.  It may be that tentative measures introduced by the Minister in this Finance Bill may help to an industrial revival.  If that is so, let us help to develop the country, and then the time may come for Deputy Johnson's proposal.  The time has not yet come, and it is chimerical when we reflect that across an imaginary land frontier there is another fiscal system in operation.  You cannot draw an imaginary line there, and it is impossible that we cannot be influenced by that.  In some cases there are men who have to pay under both systems.  In many cases there are people with financial interests in both countries, and they do what Deputy Good says&mdash; they go and spend their money, and the interest of their money, in the country where it pays them best.  That is human nature.  Speaking for myself, if I may take a personal instance, Deputy Johnson has frankly warned me of his intentions with regard to income tax.  On the day he becomes Minister for Finance I shall get out of this country with all I can take.  He can confiscate all I may leave behind, but that will not be worth more than three years' income tax. 
    
      
       We may search your pockets at the port. 
    
    
      
       You will find very little in them but a railway ticket.  My position is that of a great many other people, and Deputy Johnson's attempt will be singularly futile, for some of them are less scrupulous than I am, and already have taken care to put their money where he will not find it. 
    
     Speaking seriously, I think Deputy Johnson's proposals tend to additional insecurity and unsettlement, such as have done a lot of harm in the last four or five years.  We want to dissipate that atmosphere, and the Government have done a great deal in that direction.  Let them be prepared to   meet those arguments to realise that there is something behind them, and it may be that there will be a fulfilment in ten or twenty years time, but Deputy Johnson's desires now would mean nothing but disaster. 
    
      
       There is one small point I would like to draw attention to.  It is a matter for the future rather than the present.  I refer to the question of insisting on stamps on receipts for wages, which is the custom at the present time.  I refer especially to that practice so far as it refers to Government servants.  It may be argued when a man is paid his salary for a month, and has to pay 2d. for a stamp he has not very much of a grievance.  I do not say he has very much of a grievance, but there are other cases where a man, such as in the Post Office, etc., is paid weekly wages, and has to pay for a 2d. receipt stamp on his weekly receipt.  I think that is an unfair tax.  Many of those from whom such a tax is demanded have a small wage, and it is necessary for them to look into every penny.  I think that matter ought certainly be considered by the Government.  It is a question of a tax of something like 8/- or 9/- a year on those small wage earners. In the case of those who get a weekly wage, I would like the Minister to consider that position.  I would like him to see if there would not be some way by which the payment of this tax could be discontinued. 
       It has been suggested that if this is the law now, and that we cannot get out of it in any other way, it could be managed by paying bi-weekly.  I am sure that would be looked on by the particular people concerned as an advantage from another point of view. 
    
    
      
       I do not really know what the position is at the moment regarding that question.  I would have to look into it.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Bryan Cooper about the millionaires, I do not think he is quite well informed.  As a matter of fact, a millionaire would be taxed on his whole income only if he were domiciled here.  If he were merely resident,   he would be taxed on the amount remitted, so that I do not think that any millionaire who may come will have very much to complain of. 
    
    
      
       Will the Minister say what constitutes &ldquo;domicile&rdquo;? 
    
    
      
       I could not say that. With regard to the very interesting discussion which has taken place between Deputy Good, Deputy Johnson, and Deputy Cooper, it would suffice, perhaps, if I said that I have nothing to add to the remarks I made on that particular matter when I was introducing the Financial Resolutions. 
       Question put&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill, as amended, be received for final consideration.&rdquo; Agreed. 
       Final Stage fixed for Friday. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - LOCAL GOVERNMENT (RATES ON AGRICULTURAL LAND) BILL, 1924.&mdash;THIRD STAGE. 
     In this Act&mdash; 
     the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Local Government, 
     the expression &ldquo;county council&rdquo; does not include the council of a county borough. 
    
      
       I beg to move Amendment 1:&mdash; 
       After the words &ldquo;county borough&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;but does include Commissioners acting on behalf of a county council which has been dissolved.&rdquo; 
    
     This is merely a small provision to remedy what, I think, is an oversight in the Bill&mdash;that no provision has been made for the Counties of Leitrim and Kerry, where there are now no county councils.  I want to secure that the ratepayers in those counties shall have the same benefits, such as they are, given by this Bill, as the ratepayers in other counties.  I might follow the example of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Trade Loans Bill, and give a much more subtle description of   a county council, but I think this, which is a plain, simple, but, possibly, not legal definition, conveys the meaning sufficiently. 
    
      
       The definition of &ldquo;County Council,&rdquo; which is set out in the Bill, is a definition by exclusion. The county council is every council, except the council of a county borough, and it is not quite clear whether that does not include Commissioners.  In any case, there is no reason why there should be any doubt about the point, and, for that reason, I am accepting the amendment. 
       Amendment put, and agreed to. 
       Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
    
    
      
       I should just like to ask the reason for leaving out the county boroughs, because, in some cases, the county boroughs contain a great deal of agricultural land within their limits.  I quite agree that it would be most unreasonable if the county borough council in Dublin, or the Commissioners acting for it, were to demand a loan under the provisions of this Act.  But, I believe, in Cork&mdash;I speak subject to correction by those who know the place better&mdash;there is a very considerable amount of agricultural land included within the borough limits.  That was shown by the fact that the Farmers' Party thought it worth while to put up a candidate in Cork at the last election, and I believe he polled a considerable number of votes and was not obliged to forfeit his deposit.  The provision may press hard on  bona fide  agriculturists living within borough limits and paying heavy rates. Borough rates are invariably higher than the rates on the county-at-large. This may press hard on men like these, and I should like an explanation as to why this course is being adopted. 
    
    
      
       The amount of agricultural land included in the county boroughs is extremely small.  The valuation would be no more than £10,000 or £15,000, and the rates would be no more than £1,000 or £2,000.  That is the first reason for excluding county boroughs.  Secondly, the problems of agriculturists&mdash;if you like to use that   term&mdash;in the county boroughs, are quite different.  The agriculturist in the county borough is in a different position from the farmer who is living outside the county borough, and whose markets are far away.  The man within the county borough is doing market gardening.  He has to pay higher rates, but if he has he gets the benefit of water, heating, lighting and other things.  He is, therefore, in a different position.  In addition, he gets better prices, as he goes in for market gardening. The problem the ordinary market gardener constitutes is a wholly different problem from the problem which any ordinary farmer in any county constitutes. I agree he has his grievances also.  They are very serious, but they are not grievances of the same kind as those of the farmer outside, and this Bill is intended to deal with the man who is making his living in the ordinary way out of agricultural land. 
       
         AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE  took the Chair. 
    
    
      
       There is the other point that there are, I think, only four county boroughs in the Saorstat, leaving out Cork and Dublin.  The valuation of the land is very small, the amount of land is extremely small, and it would require exceptionally complicated and intricate arrangements to make the necessary adjustments.  It is a question really of expediency more than anything else, and the amount of land involved would hardly justify the trouble.  I just learn now that agricultural land in a county borough does not pay more than one-fourth of the rate per £ of the rates payable in the particular county borough. 
       Question put and agreed to. 
       Sections 2 and 3 put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 4. 
       (1)  A county council shall be authorised to borrow for the purposes of this Act. 
       (2)  Money borrowed for the purposes of this Act shall not be reckoned as part of the total debt of a county council for the purpose of any enactment limiting their powers of borrowing. 
    
     (3)  A loan borrowed under this   section shall be repaid within such period not exceeding seven years as the county council may, with the consent of the Minister, determine. 
     (4)  The sums required to repay the amount of the loan borrowed under this section shall be raised and levied by means of the poor rate off the agricultural land in the county. 
     (5)  Where a county council makes default in the payment of any sum payable in respect of a loan borrowed under this section, the Minister may, on complaint being made to him by the person to whom such sum is payable and after notification to the county council concerned, direct that the amount of such sum shall be deducted from the amount payable to the county council out of the agricultural grant, and the sum so deducted shall be paid to such person in discharge of such sum; provided that this enactment shall be without prejudice to the guarantee fund under the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891. 
    
      
       I move amendment 2&mdash;to delete sub-section (2).  I do so because I think it is very undesirable to encourage the growth of a municipal debt in this country.  At present we are fairly free from it.  We may have large schemes in the future that will need development by borrowing, and it would be well to keep our hands as free as possible.  If you say to a county council, or a body of that kind, that it can borrow under this Act, and that the amount it shall borrow shall not count as part of its total debt, you are to that extent giving veiled encouragement to borrowing.  You are giving the idea that if any such need occurs in the future, a similar stipulation may be put into a Bill, so that they can continue to borrow.  The Minister may say that the statutory powers of borrowing which these bodies enjoy are very small and very limited.  That is so.  They are extremely limited, but I think that should be dealt with as a question by itself in a Local Government Bill, and that we should not continually have these saving clauses put into Bills dealing with other matters, and saying that the loans shall   not be reckoned as part of the total debt of a county council.  The general policy of the Government with regard to debt has been to avoid creating debt wherever possible.  The Minister for Finance has not borrowed to anything like the extent he should.  I think it is rather a pity in a matter of this kind to reverse that policy and to put in a provision which will inevitably be in the nature of a veiled encouragement to county councils to increase their debt. 
    
    
      
       I am afraid I do not agree with Deputy Cooper in this amendment.  I think it is very important that the powers of the county councils to borrow should be retained. As the Deputy has pointed out, the borrowing powers of these councils is not very great, and I think, in an important Bill of this kind, which deals to a certain extent with questions outside the scope of the county councils, that nothing should be done to interfere with the powers they at present possess.  Therefore, I hope this amendment will not be accepted. 
    
    
      
       I do not think the amendment would be a good amendment to insert in the Bill.  There may be some county councils who for various reasons have had to borrow considerable sums of money, and if they want to give relief under this Bill they may be unable to do it without further borrowing.  I think it would be most undesirable that the amendment should be inserted.  On the other hand, there are other county councils which have very little debt, and it would not affect them to any great extent.  There are some county councils in the Saorstat which had to borrow in recent years, and if this amendment were accepted it would handicap them and perhaps nullify the effect of this Bill. 
    
    
      
       I think, before one could consider this amendment one would have to be informed regarding the use of borrowing powers by the county councils.  If, as I think, some of the county councils have very nearly exhausted their borrowing powers, of course this Act will be of no use to those councils.  To the extent that the councils have used up their borrowing   powers, acceptance of the amendment would mean that the Act is not going to be of any use to these councils.  I would ask Deputy Bryan Cooper, when continuing this discussion, if he will tell us, or if he can tell us, how it will affect the county councils, assuming that the county councils still desire to use this Bill for the purpose of borrowing money. 
    
    
      
       In view of Deputy Hughes' statement that this amendment would impose hardships on certain county councils who have borrowed up to their limit, I shall withdraw it, although I cannot help thinking it might be a good thing for them to be taught a lesson.  I do not want the farmers of these counties to be excluded from any of the benefits, or alleged benefits, of this Bill.  I know Deputy Hughes has a larger experience of local administration than I have and I take his word that the amendment would impose hardships on these counties.  I withdraw it therefore. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
    
    
      
       I move amendment 3.  In sub-section (3) to delete the word &ldquo;seven,&rdquo; line 7, and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;ten.&rdquo; 
    
     This amendment means that loans borrowed under this section shall be repaid in 10 years instead of 7 years. I put it down because, after the Minister's speech on the Second Reading, I find no reason to hope that the agricultural depression will have passed in 7 years, or that the county councils will be in a much better position to repay than they are now.  Agricultural depression usually moves in cycles, and those who observe those cycles know that a cycle lasts usually 12 or 14 years. The present agricultural depression may be said to have begun about 4 years ago, possibly five years.  The Minister's proposal would, therefore, bring it within the minimum limit of the cycle, while my amendment would extend it to the maximum.  While I do not want to upset any arrangements made with the Bank&mdash;and, of course, it will be optional to the Bank or anybody making the loan to stipulate 7 years, which is only a statutory limitation&mdash;I think a little more latitude   would be wise and would work better in administration.  I beg, therefore, to move the amendment. 
    
      
       I would press this amendment on the Minister for very much the same reason as I objected to the last amendment.  There are many councils, both urban and county councils, who have borrowed money for different stated periods.  Owing to the difficult circumstances in which these councils have been placed they have not been able to meet their instalments, and I think the principle that this amendment involves is a very good one. I might not agree with Deputy Cooper as to the period of ten years, but I certainly approve of the period being extended.  I have certain strong ideas in regard to this matter. 
    
    
      
       Deputies will note that the next amendment, Amendment No. 4, deals with this matter. The amendment which will be moved by Deputy Duggan proposes in sub-section (3), line 7, after the word &ldquo;years,&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;on the 31st day of March, 1925.&rdquo;  If that amendment is accepted, the sub-section will read: &ldquo;A loan borrowed under this section shall be repaid within such period not exceeding seven years from the 31st March, 1925, as the county council may with the consent of the Minister determine.&rdquo;  That is giving little less than 8 years from now so that there is not much between myself and Deputy Cooper.  I previously pointed out that besides the rate-payers and the county councils there are other parties interested in this scheme and they are the banks.  The banks have met us fairly in this matter.  This is not, strictly speaking, a banking proposition. This is not normal banking, but they have met us very fairly, and the Standing Committee have agreed to leave this loan 7 years from the 31st March, 1925, and to have it repaid by annuity.  That is a big concession.  This is not ordinary banking business, and as they are parties without whom this section cannot work I certainly did not feel inclined to press them any further than that.  I would like myself if we could get 10 or 12 years but we must recognise the banking difficulties, in these matters, and the difficulties are   that in ordinary circumstances they would not allow money to be outstanding for such a long period.  In view of that fact and of the fact that without the banks we cannot do business under this Bill, I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment. 
    
    
      
       I do not agree with the Minister that there is very little difference between 9 months and 36 months.  I hope he is going to go on the principle that there is very little difference between 9 and 36 when he starts grading the eggs. 
    
    
      
       It means 2d. in the £. 
    
    
      
       I cannot follow that.  I would require to know more about the valuation.  In view of the fact that arrangements have been made with the banks and that to break them would be to destroy the Bill, I do not want to upset them, although I have no exaggerated idea of the benefits to be brought about by them.  I will withdraw the amendment, with the leave of the Dail. 
    
    
      
       The Minister speaks of an arrangement with the banks.  I think it would be interesting and valuable to know what that exactly means. Does it mean that the Minister has consulted the banks  en bloc  or separately, arriving at a similar agreement? Does it mean that there is an association of bankers which decides these questions; in fact that there is a banking trust.  I know there is an association, but I thought it purported to deal with internal arrangements between the banks.  Now it seems&mdash;unless the Minister can correct it&mdash;there is an association of bankers who will make terms with the Government and I presume that if one bank desires to go better than another that a stop is put to that bank, that its little game is checked and that, as a matter of practice, the banks are able to control the Government, and through the Government, to control the country.  I would like to know definitely from the Minister what exactly he means by saying that he has made an arrangement with the banks and that they have agreed to this.  Is it an arrangement with   each bank separately and independently or is it an arrangement with the banks taken altogether?  If so, is that the common process of making engagements between the Government and Finance Institutions? 
    
    
      
       This is a red herring. The fact is this Bill really gives power to a county council to exercise an option.  It may or may not exercise that option.  I thought it good business myself&mdash;on behalf of the county councils, if you like&mdash;to find out whether the banks would, in the event of a county council approaching its particular treasurer, facilitate us in this matter. I took the trouble of writing to the Secretary of the Standing Committee of the banks and asking when their next meeting would be, and whether they could not arrange an interview with me after a meeting of the Standing Committee of the banks.  The Standing Committee of the banks is a committee which includes representatives from all the banks.  They would be all in Dublin on the same occasion, and I found it a convenient time to see them.  I dare say I could have been them one by one, and as a matter of arrangement I could have seen the representatives of the banks when they would be in Dublin at a meeting of the Standing Committee once a fortnight or once a week.  But, as a matter of expediency, I thought it is advisable to see all the representatives of all the banks, and I asked them if a county council came to any of them and sought the facilities which they are entitled to ask for under the Bill would they give the county councils those facilities.  They said they would.  I asked what period for repayment of the loan would suit, and I suggested the number of years set out here, and that was agreed to. 
    
     That is all that is in it.  There is nothing to hide and there is nothing to keep back.  We need not have done that at all.  We might have allowed each county council to go to its treasurer.  One bank might say that they would give five or six years; another might arrange eight or nine years; and still another would mention ten years.  It was much more convenient for the county councils to see the banks beforehand and to ask them   to make a uniform arrangement.  That was done.  It is not that the banks limit the number of years; probably the banks will give a greater number of years for the repayment by the county councils than if they had not been approached. 
    
      
       The Dail will have noted with interest Deputy Johnson's disapproval of combination for the purpose of bargaining, and will await his resignation from his trades union in order to prove his consistency.  I beg to withdraw the amendment. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move: &ldquo;In sub-section 3, line 7, after the word &lsquo;years&rsquo; to insert &lsquo;from the 31st day of March, 1925.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Question: &ldquo;That Section 4, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 5. 
       (1)  This Act may be cited as the Local Government (Rates on Agricultural Land) Act, 1924, and shall be read and construed as one with the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898 to 1919. 
       (2)  The Local Government (Ireland) Acts, 1898 to 1919, and this Act may be cited together as the Local Government (Ireland) Acts, 1898 to 1919. 
    
    
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (2), line 27, to delete the figures &ldquo;1919&rdquo; and insert in lieu thereof the figures &ldquo;1924.&rdquo; That is to cover the present Bill when it becomes an Act. 
    
    
      
       It is a verbal error, and I am accepting the amendment. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash; put and agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Title stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - DAIL RESUMES. 
     Bill reported with amendments. 
    
      
       May I move the motion which follows on the Orders of the   Day?  It reads as follows:&mdash; 
       That the provisions of Standing Orders 86 and 88 as to the giving of notice for the taking of the Fourth and Fifth Stages of a Bill be suspended to permit of the Fourth and Fifth Stages of the Local Government (Rates on Agricultural Land) Bill, 1924, being taken to-day, Tuesday, 24th June, 1924. 
    
    
      
       If there is opposition to the motion which stands in the name of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, I must consider the question of accepting it. 
    
    
      
       I want to say that I think this is too much.  We have just passed the Committee Stage of a Bill, and though there has been no opposition to it, to ask us now to agree to suspend the Standing Orders in order to take the succeeding stages, no matter how trifling may have been the amendments to the Bill, is asking the Dail to loose its control.  This is rather a matter of putting a stop to this galloping method, and in the circumstances I am opposing the motion. There is another motion a little later on in regard to another Bill, which is, in my view, much more urgent. 
       I think the Dail will need to be more careful about allowing such Motions as these to pass.  As I said two or three days ago, when we thought we were working to a time-table, there might be some justification for this, but when all that has disappeared, and we are simply asked to gallop through legislation, I urge on the Dail the necessity for taking a little care and putting a little rein on the Ministerial desire to get through business. 
    
     I do not think the Minister will lose anything by postponing this for at least one day, and I would suggest to him that the Dail would be much more agreeable to take the final stages of the Bill as the first business to-morrow, if he desires to present the Bill to the Seanad then.  I do not know what his intentions are.  I suggest that there is no need to take those further stages to-day without notice.  I am asking the Dail to oppose the motion because there is no case made for it, and as far as I can, I want to put a stay upon this   method of galloping through legislation. 
    
      
       I do not know whether the Deputy means that under no circumstances, good, bad, or indifferent, should the Fourth and Fifth Stages of a Bill be taken.  He may mean that, and there may be something to be said for it.  That is the only attitude consistent with his opposition.  Whether this Bill is good, bad, or indifferent, and whether its defects are small or great, it is an urgent measure.  I know its limitations.  It is only an expedient, and a second-rate expedient at that, but such as it is it is extremely urgent. 
       It is a Bill dealing with the collection of this year's rates.  It is obvious demand notes should be sent out as soon as possible, and there should be no holding up of the rate collection. The Bill consists of five sections, and it is extremely simple.  It has been before the Dail for a month, and Deputies must know every clause of it by heart if they are really interested. Here it is three weeks after being introduced, and there are verbal amendments proposed by myself to the Bill. I do not believe any body really wishes to deny the extreme urgency of the Bill and the necessity for having no holding up of the collection of rates; also, it is a very short and simple Bill. I put it to the Dail that if the taking of the remaining Stages is justified in any case it is justified in this, and I ask for approval of the Motion which I have on the Order Paper.  Deputy Johnson knows enough about Parliamentary procedure to know that a little time makes a lot of difference, and the getting of the Bill through the Dail to-day instead of to-morrow would facilitate matters greatly. 
    
    
      
       I appeal to Deputy Johnson to withdraw his opposition to this Bill, and in speaking on the Bill now I take the opportunity of correcting a mis-report of my remarks on the Second Reading.  This report appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; where it was stated that I opposed this Bill on behalf of the farmers.  What I said was that I accepted the Bill.  We do accept   it as a second rate expedient.  We think that the proper way of relieving the agricultural community is by increasing the agricultural grant.  This is not a grant.  It is a totally different thing altogether.  It is something that we have got to pay back, and pay back with interest, and our point of view is that a grant is the only thing that would meet the situation.  However, there is an effort made to tide us over a difficulty.  Deputy Cooper alludes to this as being within a certain cycle of depression&mdash;&mdash; 
    
    
      
       I am afraid the Deputy is not speaking to the motion. 
    
    
      
       Oh, I know very well I am out of order, but I think now I have got in everything I wanted to say. 
    
    
      
       I appeal to Deputy Johnson not to oppose this motion. From my own experience I know that there are demand notes for over two months lying up in the county council offices, and it will take two or three weeks after the passing of this Bill into law to get them changed in accordance with the decision the individual county council may arrive at as a result of the Act.  That will mean that if this Bill is held up in the Seanad there will be no rates collected at all until August.  For that reason I would ask Deputy Johnson to waive his objection. 
    
    
      
       I only wanted to try to prevent this method of getting through legislation.  This is a very simple thing, but you all know the story: &ldquo;It is only a little one.&rdquo;  But the next may be bigger.  In view of what the Minister said I will not oppose this motion, but I hope that it will not be taken as an acquiescence in this method of legislation. 
    
    
      
       I move the motion. 
       Motion put and agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
    
     
    
      
       The Seanad will be informed accordingly. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL, 1924.&mdash;REPORT STAGE. 
    
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       To add to Section 6, page 3, a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
       (3) Section 35 of the Principal Act (which relates to the purposes for which the Minister may make regulations) shall have effect as if there were added to paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of that section the following:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;For requiring, on the consideration and examination of any such claims and questions, the attendance of any person whose presence is necessary or desirable for the purpose of giving evidence concerning such claims and questions, and.&rdquo; 
       This amendment is proposed as an alternative to the one introduced by Deputy Corish when the Bill was in Committee.  It is very much more general in its terms, and it will give the Minister power to compel the attendance of any person as a witness concerning evidence as to claims and questions. 
    
    
      
       I think this amendment meets the case that I have pleaded, for the courts should have power to call employers as well as employees as witnesses.  This gives general powers, and I accept it. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
    
    
      
       There was another amendment to be considered, but no amendment has been introduced on foot of that.  It has been considered.  I read again what Deputy Morrissey said in introducing it, and I came to the conclusion that the amendment had been wrongly worded or else that wrong arguments had been used in putting forward the amendment.  In so far as the amendment meant what it said I repeat again what I said on the last occasion, and that is that the carrying out of the section is done in accordance with what   has been proposed by the amendment. But the arguments used by Deputy Morrissey went further, and urged that men should not be moved from a district where a higher rate of wages prevailed to one where a lower rate prevailed.  That seemed to me to enlarge the right to benefit. I do not think that the enlargement of a right to benefit should take place upon a temporary Bill.  If there are well-founded complaints, then there is time between this and the going of the Bill into the Seanad for some samples of these complaints being sent to me for consideration, and the matter can be gone into, and an amendment may be accepted in the Seanad.  If the second point is what the Deputy has in mind, I do not think that that could be accepted on a merely temporary Bill. 
    
    
      
       I think the Minister should understand that the complaint which the amendment as originally proposed was intended to remove was that there had been frequent complaints of offers of employment at considerably lower rates&mdash;not merely lower rates, but at a difference which was so great that it was an invitation to the employed person to refuse to accept employment in that low wage district.  The suspicion is that that practice has been adopted in some districts simply for the purpose of striking a man off the lists.  He is invited, in fact, to refuse employment in such a district.  Whether I can produce any considerable number of individual cases I cannot promise, but that the practice prevails I am convinced, in view of a considerable number of general complaints that I have heard from time to time.  I am sorry that I did not notice that that amendment had not been embodied in this Report stage.  I had overlooked the fact that it had been withdrawn, for I thought it had been accepted.  I am sorry now that the matter is to be dealt with in the Seanad.  I will endeavour to bring specific evidence before the Minister, and I have no doubt I would be able to do so if the legislative programme was not so heavy, and we had time.  But unfortunately between one Bill and another we have not time to think about   the Bills, let alone examine them and bring instances forward in support of our amendments.  The chances of a Research Department are very little when dealing with Bills in this manner.  I assure the Minister the complaint which has been spoken of, and which he sought to remedy, is fairly widely held, and it is a grievance which is felt by quite a number of trades and people concerned in the administration of Unemployment Insurance, believing that the administration is weighted against them in that particular. 
    
    
      
       Deputy Johnson's first line of attack is to stress the point about the speed at which legislation is going through this House.  I have before me the fact that time might be required to bring forward complaints, but I have also the very specific statement made by Deputy Johnson on the Third Stage, to the effect: &ldquo;I assure the Minister that if this Bill had not been brought in when it was, he would have had a request from the Executive of the Trades Union Congress, and from the Cork Workers' Council, to receive a deputation on this specific question.  We had a conference to discuss this matter, and I had complaints time and again from many parts of the country, and amongst those complaints this is one of the most insistent.&rdquo;&mdash;[Official Report, 18th June, 1924, column 2567.] 
       Surely these cases are ready and can be supplied to me between this and the going of the Bill to the Seanad. 
    
    
      
       I will do my best to bring them forward, but when one is here for 12 hours a day it is not so easy to do it. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill, as amended, be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I move: &ldquo;That the provisions of Standing Order 88 as to the giving of notice for the taking of the fifth stage of a Bill be suspended to permit of the Fifth Stage of the Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1924,   being taken to-day (Tuesday), 24th June, 1924.&rdquo; 
       On the question of urgency I point to the fact that the 29th June is the operative date, and this is the 24th of June.  I think that reveals the cause for urgency. 
    
    
      
       I protest against this procedure, and unless the Minister can show me that there is extreme urgency in this particular case I cannot agree.  This Bill was introced only a fortnight ago.  It has been hurried through its First, Second, and Fourth Stages, and the least that could be done now would be to give Deputies an opportunity of considering the Bill before the last stage is taken. It is a long Bill, and a highly contentious Bill, and I do not think that in regard to this Bill this resolution should be agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I support the Minister to give him an opportunity of reading the Bill which he says is a long Bill.  It consists of twelve short clauses, but in view of the fact that the Minister has not been able to read it&mdash;and that is quite obvious&mdash;then clearly and fairly I think he has a right to ask, before the Bill passes, that he should have an opportunity of reading and understanding it.  Therefore I shall support the Minister if he takes such action as will ensure the postponement of the Bill to a later date. 
       Question: &ldquo;That the Standing Order be suspended&rdquo;&mdash;put and declared carried. 
       Question, &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Ordered that the Seanad be informed accordingly. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE BILL, 1924.&mdash;FIFTH STAGE. 
    
      
       I move that this Bill do now pass. 
       Question put and agreed to. 
       Ordered that the Seanad be informed accordingly. 
    
   
   
     INTOXICATING LIQUOR BILL, 1924 (SECOND STAGE). - DEBATE RESUMED. 
     
    
      
       On Friday last I listened to the debate on this Bill.  I have come to the conclusion that the Minister for Justice, in company with many of the Deputies who delivered speeches in support of the measure, seems to have become convinced that he and they are dealing with a nation of drunkards, and that Ireland is the home of drunkards. If that is their opinion it is certainly not mine.  I do not believe that Ireland to-day is as bad as the Total Abstinence Association and other organisations of that kind would like to make us believe that it is.  From my travels around I have come to the conclusion that drunkenness has diminished, especially during the last seven or eight years.  Therefore, I do not believe for a moment that any man is justified in supporting a measure of this kind.  Drunkenness has been reduced by, I believe, fifty per cent. in this country, and as far as I am concerned I do not believe that Ireland was ever a very drunken nation.  Section 1 of the Bill prohibits the opening of licensed houses at particular hours, and specifies their closing at particular hours.  Under this section a very grave and unjust hardship will in my opinion be entailed on a very large number of people who compose the marketing community.  For many years, and at the present day we have what are known as a number of night houses. These houses are open to people coming to the city with market produce. They are on practically every road leading to the city, and the people who take advantage of them travel in some cases distances of from 30 to 35 miles, and in some instances as far as 40 miles. It has been customary for a great many years, and the custom prevailed under the existing licensing law, to allow these houses on the main roads leading to the city to remain open until 5 o'clock in the morning.  That was allowed for the purpose of affording men travelling with farm produce to the city an opportunity of getting refreshment, not only for themselves but for their horses.  It was customary for these people to take the horses from   the cars and to give them food and drink, and also to give the animals a couple of hours' rest.  Such a custom is observed in Clonee, which is about twenty-seven miles distant from Dublin. Some of the people who put up there for a few hours during the night travel from near Delvin to the city of Dublin with farm produce.  They do not arrive at Clonee until about 3 o'clock in the morning.  They stop at this house and get refreshments for themselves and also give their horses a couple of hours' rest.  That rest is necessary for the animals as well as for the men themselves. 
       As I read Section 1 of this Bill, that custom is going to be abolished.  If these people open their houses now at that hour in the morning and allow men going to the market in to have refreshments, they can be prosecuted if the Civic Guard come along and catch them on the premises.  Therefore, I oppose this section, because I think it is a bad one.  There is another point in this section to which I wish to direct attention. We all know that in country villages and in provincial towns people drive in on Sunday mornings from the country to church.  Up to the present it has been customary with them to put up their horses in the yards attached to licensed premises while they were away at church themselves.  If they were to leave their horses and cars on the public streets, without anyone in charge of them, they would be liable to be prosecuted on the charge of the animals not being under proper control.  Under this section these people, whether bona fide travellers or not, are forbidden to enter licensed premises, even to the extent of putting up their horses and cars while attending church.  Under the Act the yard is part of the licensed premises, and hence people will not be allowed to enter the yard for the purpose of stabling their horses.  That will impose a great hardship on people, and I suggest it is a matter that deserves consideration from the Minister. 
    
    
      
       If the Deputy would excuse me, I would like to intervene for a moment.  In the course of his speech he has made two points, and I am wondering   whether he has read the memorandum which deals with the position as to bona fide travellers.  I would like him to tell me under what part of the section you are prevented from putting up your horse in a yard during certain hours. 
    
    
      
       It is not definitely specified in the Bill, but I take the position to be as I have stated it, that if people put up their horses and cars in a yard attached to a public house, which, was I understand it, is part of the licensed premises, they will be liable to prosecution if found there during prohibited hours.  Even the publican himself will be open to prosecution for opening his yard gate to allow these people in with their horses and cars.  That is the construction that I put on the reading of this section. 
    
    
      
       Did you read the memo? 
    
    
      
       Probably I am wrong, but if I am the Minister will correct me.  I now come to the section dealing with mixed trading.  I believe that this, too, will impose great hardship on people in this country.  I do not want to dwell too long on it, as the majority of Deputies spoke at some length on the section.  Its chances of passing are, I think, very poor, and I intend to oppose the Bill on these two issues. The hours for trading on week-days are from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.  I cannot see how the Minister can reasonably ask the community, as a whole, to accept this particular clause of the Bill, because on every morning in the week there is a fair being held in some part of Ireland.  Many fairs start as early as 3.30 in the morning, but the majority start business at about 4 a.m.  I know that in the Co. Meath several fairs are held at 4 o'clock in the morning. I do not think it is reasonable or fair to ask men who have been walking all night with cattle, and who arrive at a town where a fair is held, to stand on the fair from 4 o'clock in the morning until 9 o'clock without an opportunity of getting some refreshments. I think that is most unreasonable, and I think the same remark applies to closing on Good Friday, as that is also a   fair day and a general working day in the country, where it is not observed in the same way as in the city of Dublin.  I intend to oppose the Bill on that issue also.  I am not of the same mind as some Deputies on the Labour Benches as regards the employment of female assistants under eighteen years of age in public-houses.  I believe that if a girl is going to take up employment as a barmaid that she ought to be allowed to go into the business house in which she proposes to serve her time at sixteen years of age, so that she may be able to draw a salary when she reaches the age of eighteen.  Under this Bill a girl is denied that opportunity, because under this section she must be eighteen years of age before she is allowed into licensed premises to serve her time, and then she will be twenty years of age before she is entitled to draw a salary. 
    
     I know many publichouses in which female assistants are employed, and I do not see anything very wrong happening. I do not see girls going to the bad from all the wild talk and dirty language that it is alleged is heard in publichouses.  As far as my experience goes, I do not think employment in publichouses corrupts girls' morals in the least.  If some Deputies who have supported this particular section in the Bill would give us some facts where a particular female shop assistant has gone wrong as a result of the bad things she heard in publichouses, I might be inclined to agree with them, but I do not think there is a Deputy in the Dail who could give us a concrete statement on that.  All their talk on that was pure theory, and they were merely expressing their own feelings as to what they would do with their own daughters.  Some of them told us that a publichouse is no place for the employment of a girl, but if this section goes through where are the thousands of girls at present employed as barmaids going to find employment if they are not allowed to work in licensed premises.  I do not think it is fair either to prohibit a publican's daughter from serving behind the counter while her father or mother may be absent for ten or fifteen minutes at their tea.  If she is under eighteen   years of age she will not be allowed to go behind the counter while her parents are at their tea.  That would impose a very great injustice, especially on country traders, many of whom are very poor men, and are not in a position to employ assistants.  If this section goes through it will mean that they will have to close up their business altogether. 
     I know some publicans and they have to go out and work by the day because the business they do would not be sufficient to support them otherwise. In fact, I know some publicans and they are members of the Transport Union.  I, like Deputy Hogan, do not agree with the section which prohibits a publican from giving credit.  I do not see why we in the Dail should protect the publican any more than we protect any other class of trader.  I believe that under the common law as it exists at the moment, if a publican serves drink to a man so that he gets blind drunk every day in the week in his shop that he cannot recover the cost of the drink if the man gets drunk by running into debt in his shop.  I ask why the publican has not the moral courage to protect himself by refusing to give drink on credit to such a man as that.  I think the publican should turn over a new leaf and do a cash trade, but at any rate I think we are not here to protect him if he does give credit. 
     I think that Deputy Davin, speaking in support of late opening in the morning, went further than he really might when he found that the worker was the strongest pillar to rest upon in support of his argument.  If he did not exactly say it, at all events he left it to be inferred that no one entered a public house for drink before nine o'clock in the morning but the working man. 
    
      
       I did not say that at all. 
    
    
      
       I have drawn that inference anyway, and I certainly say that there is a good deal less drunkenness amongst workingmen than there is amongst wealthy people.  The reasons why they are not drunk in the morning before they go to work are there for anyone to see.  There are many reasons.  In the first instance, they have   not sufficient pay to purchase the necessaries of life for their households, and, secondly, if they go in to work drunk, to Deputy Good, for instance, I guarantee that they will not go in the next morning; he would dismiss them at once.  We have not heard of many of these cases&mdash;&mdash; 
    
    
      
       We are not discussing the working or any other class, but the Bill. 
    
    
      
       We are discussing references that have been made, and I say that this argument is not an argument that should be entertained, because it goes no distance in building up support for this Bill.  I have never seen a man going drunk to his work, and I know very few men who have been in the habit of resorting to the public house before going to work.  Arguments like this are, I think, uncalled for.  I never noticed it, and I was surprised when I heard a Deputy on these Benches making that declaration. 
    
    
      
       I think that anyone who ventures on this thorny subject of licensing enters on a very difficult path; in fact, it would require a superman to satisfy the contending factions in this dispute, the extreme temperance people and the licensed trade, and he is a lucky man who can draw a happy mean between the two.  I think this Bill is an honest attempt, so far as it goes, to do that.  There are certain things in it which are open to amendment, but the value to be obtained from the Bill is far in excess of its faults.  I think the section dealing with poteen is very important.  There is no doubt that there is nothing that does more damage to the country and to the minds of the people than this abominable stuff.  The licensing of clubs is also a most valuable thing.  I do not see any reason why they should not be on exactly the same status as the public house, and it is only reasonable that they should be well under control.  I think that the part dealing with the sale of methylated spirits is also an extremely valuable addition. There is no doubt at all that in many parts of the country this pernicious spirit has been drunk extensively, and I am glad to see that the Government is   going to stop it.  There are, of course, as there are in every Bill, things that one would take exception to.  There is the division of the licensed premises into two parts, the separation of the licensed part from the part where other goods are sold, and I think that in the present state of things it would be extremely unfair to ask licensed people to do that.  It would involve enormous cost to carry it out, and it would be obviously most unjust to ask the holders of licenses to do it, except they were to get compensation from the Government, and the Exchequer is not in a state to stand that. Therefore, I cannot support that section, and I understand that the Minister will not insist on it.  I am almost a total abstainer; I am afraid that I would not be accepted by the unco' guid as belonging to them, but nevertheless I hold for the encouragement of temperance as much as possible. But one thing I noticed during the thirty years or so that I sat on a bench of magistrates and tried to administer justice after a sort, was that the majority of cases in the country districts that came before one were cases of drunkenness on Sundays&mdash;and that with the public houses all closed.  It showed that something must have been very wrong.  Of course, we hope, in these days, with an efficient Garda Siochana, that such a thing will not prevail, but undoubtedly in the old days it was the case.  Certainly before the different courts in which I have been, there was a great deal more drunkenness to be found on a Sunday, when all the front doors were shut, than there was on any other day of the week. 
    
     I came to the conclusion, therefore, that it would be much better to be honest about the thing, and to have the number of houses largely reduced in the country districts, so that they could be under control, and to have them open on Sundays for about two hours, just as they are in the towns, and have it done openly and above board, because it was done.  But we hope that with the new regime that will not be necessary.  I see that the Minister still seeks to allow houses to be opened in certain towns on Sundays for a certain   number of hours, but not in the country districts.  Let it be so; we will see how it acts.  A wand may be swept over the scene and everything may be altered for the good.  I hope it will be so. But my idea is&mdash;and I hope that in the next Bill it will come to pass&mdash;that a large number of licences will be extinguished by payment of compensation, and that there will be greater and better supervision over those that will remain.  I think that that is the fairest way to deal with what is a reasonable and a right trade that should have its chances, like any other trade, but should be under strict control.  I hope that it will be on these lines that licensing in the future will be carried out.  I intend to support the Bill.  Those of my constituents who have approached me on the subject are of my opinion, that the Bill ought to be supported, with the exception of Section 12.  Of course, a good many think that an extra hour on a fair morning, as the Deputy who has just spoken instanced, might be allowed, and I think there is a great deal in it.  Perhaps the Minister might consider that on the Committee Stage.  But, with this and the other exception that I have mentioned, I think the Bill is a very fair attempt to try to improve a very difficult situation, and I hope that it will be improved upon later on by a Bill that will finally settle the question. 
    
      
       I think that the Minister deserves credit for having produced a Bill that has met with such a fair reception from the Dail, whether from members like myself who object to many clauses, or members who support it and think that it has not gone far enough.  The Minister has made a good case for the Second Reading and deserves to get it.  Many speeches would have been better delivered, I think, on the Committee Stage.  I will confine myself merely to two aspects. Clause 12 has been largely commented on.  I listened very attentively to one of the observations by the Minister when presenting the Bill for Second Reading, and that was the one ending up with the village blacksmith going for a shilling's worth of nails into a mixed house who was liable to be   tempted to spend his money in liquid refreshment instead of buying the nails.  That was a valid but very farfetched excuse.  The second, shall I call it apologia, was that the unemployed question would be affected, and that unemployed would get employment in altering the structures of the houses that would be dealt with under the Bill. I do not know whether or not that would tempt Deputy Johnson to support the Bill.  I am sure that outside that he will give it consideration, but I think that a clause which has only that recommendation is one that should be left out as unsuitable.  The general voice of the Dail is decidedly against Clause 12, and I trust when it comes up in Committee that the Minister for Justice will take that into consideration and drop it entirely.  Another matter which, as a resident of Dublin, I should like to call the attention of the Dail to is the question of the added areas in this city.  I have looked into the case presented by people in these areas who wish to be relieved of their grievances, and I think they have made out a strong case. 
    
     I trust sincerely when the Bill comes up in Committee that the Minister will give favourable consideration to their claims.  Some of the other clauses are very necessary from my point of view, but from the point of view of the temperance advocate the Bill does not meet the question at all.  The Minister referred to the sociological aspect of it, but the Bill does not meet that aspect completely.  Having found the views of the Deputies, and of those they represent in the country parts, I make the suggestion to the Minister to drop the Bill, and set up a commission representing the divergent interests to thrash this question out, and bring in a complete Bill that will be accepted throughout the country as a whole.  I wish to refer to only one other portion of the Bill, and that is parts 4 and 5, dealing with illicit distillation and methylated spirits.  It seems to me, from my knowledge of these subjects, that if the Minister made these two offences so that they could be dealt with under the criminal law he would have the support of the Dail.  Certainly he deserves the thanks of this Dail for having dealt   with them in the manner he has done. I support the Second Reading. 
    
      
       I do not intend to prolong the discussion much, but I wish in the first place to enter a protest against having the Bill introduced at this stage.  We in the Dail who have endeavoured to keep in touch with the legislation passing through find it almost impossible to become really conversant with the Bills poured on us from day to day.  The result is that Bills pass through with which we are not thoroughly acquainted.  I believe it is the duty of any Deputy who wants properly to perform the work for which he is sent here to be conversant, as far as is in his power, with the details of the Bills passed through the Dail.  This is a highly contentious measure of social reform for which there should be ample time given, not only to the Dail but to the people of the country, to discuss and hammer out what they consider would be the best system of temperance reform.  I do not know why the Bill was introduced at this stage.  The Minister probably has his reasons for doing so, but I think the reforms advocated in it are not sufficient to justify the time of the Dail being taken up at this stage of the sittings when Deputies are tired perhaps of poring over the different Bills, and when this measure will not get the proper consideration which it deserves. 
    
     As far as the Bill itself is concerned, I am inclined to think that it is only right to give a measure of support to any reforms which will tend to improve the social life of the country, as far as the use of intoxicating liquors is concerned.  I am not at all sure that the reforms are of any great importance, and that there will be any wonderful change in the conditions of the country as regards the consumption of drink.  My knowledge of the country is, as far as intoxication is concerned, that the people have improved enormously within recent years.  I know it was quite a common thing at one time to see many drunken men in the streets of Dublin.  Now it is very rare to see such a thing happen.  It is a saying down in the country that Lloyd George was the greatest reformer that ever attempted to deal with the temperance   question.  His system was by the increase of taxation on drink; he made it almost impossible for the average man to get more than he could bear. This Bill evidently is an attempt to deal with the problem to a certain extent. I think it is the duty of those who are endeavouring to secure a measure of temperance reform to give it a conditional measure of support.  I am prepared to do that, but there are certain sections I do not approve of, and which I think capable of amendment in Committee.  In particular I refer to section 12, which has been so much discussed.  My objection to that section is not that the idea in itself is not a good one, for I believe it is, but I do not believe that it is feasible or just to carry it out in the existing circumstances.  I think the ideal the Minister is aiming at is a correct one, but as the Bill stands it will be inequitable and it will hit the people who should not be hit.  The poorer publicans will be forced to carry out these reforms, while the larger and richer publicans will not. 
     They will be forced to carry out these structural alterations in houses which are not, in many cases, architecturally suited to such alterations.  I know myself of a public house which, perhaps, corresponds to the Minister's example, where nails can be purchased at one side of the house and drink at the other.  It is a long, narrow public house, with buildings at each side, and, as far as I can see, it would be a physical impossibility to make the alterations which the Minister demands even with the thinnest possible partition. Such being the objections to that section, the support which I give to the Bill is conditional on amendment of that section. 
     With regard to the prohibition of the employment of girls under 18 in a bar, I have no objection to that section provided it does not forbid the employment of the members of the family of the owner of the premises.  If that is the intention I think it would actually be impossible to carry it out.  It would be quite impossible for the owner of a public house to avoid having his children attend at the bar on rare occasions.  If that section is not   eliminated, at least, amendments ought to be put forward which would have the effect of allowing the members of the family of the publican to attend in the bar when required. 
    
      
       I intend to support the Second Reading of the Bill, because I agree with most of its provisions&mdash;not all, but practically all.  I think that the hours which are proposed in the Bill are reasonable.  The demand, if there is a demand, ought to be for reasonable refreshment and facilities for reasonable refreshment and no more.  I maintain that under the provisions of the Bill such facilities are available.  It has been said with some truth that to introduce a Bill of this kind at this stage of the session is not treating the matter fairly, or as it should be treated.  We cannot fail to remember, however, that a Bill somewhat on these lines was introduced this time last year and dropped.  Certainly the question in all its bearings has been before the country for a considerable time.  In any case, it is quite evident on the face of it that this measure proposes only to deal with the fringes of the question, and does not purport to be by any means the last word in licensing legislation.  Even if this Bill is passed now there will still, in my opinion, be a necessity for a Commission to go into the whole question of our licensing laws. 
    
     As I stated, I think the hours of working are reasonable.  I do not profess to be intimately acquainted with the licensing laws, but I do believe there are provisions whereby exceptional licenses may be obtained for exceptional purposes.  In such cases as those mentioned by Deputy Hall I do not think there is any great grievance. If the Deputy tells me that a fair starts at 3.30 or 4 in the morning, and that, therefore, it is necessary to open the publichouses to accommodate the people who come to the fairs, I would retort that it is far more reasonable to arrange that the fair would not open at such an unreasonable hour.  I never could see the reason for having fairs at such unseasonable hours as 3.30, 4 or 5 a.m.  Undoubtedly that was the practice in the old days, but it has died out to a considerable extent.   Even under the present arrangements a man has to wait until 7 o'clock before he can get a drink, and if he has patience to wait that length he will not have a very great grievance if he has to wait for another hour or two. 
     There is one provision in the Bill which I strongly commend, and that is the section which prohibits the sale of drink to young persons under eighteen. I also approve of the regulation to prevent young girls under eighteen being employed in a bar.  I have doubts as to whether that should not be extended to young boys under eighteen.  Indeed, I think it would be advisable.  If it is wrong to sell drink to children under eighteen, it is wrong to have such children selling drink, and I make no distinction whatsoever in the case of the owner's children.  If it is wrong to have a young girl employed at that work, it is wrong for the publican to put his own daughter to that work.  It has been said that the publican might find it necessary to leave his daughter in charge of the shop while he was having a cup of tea.  The sacrifice will not be very great if that is all the sacrifice he will have to make, because he will be able to find someone to look after the shop while he is away. 
     I approve of the proposal with regard to clubs.  I never could see the reason why there should be special facilities given to clubs for the sale of drink.  A club is supposed to be an establishment for a purpose other than the sale or consumption of spirituous liquor.  I am greatly afraid that there are, at least, some clubs that seem to have quite misconceived that idea.  If one can draw conclusions from practice, the sole object, sometimes, seems to be the consumption of liquor.  I quite agree that a club, such as a golf club, might be in a different position from some clubs established for indoor amusement.  In neither case can the claim be made for an extension of facilities for the sale of drink.  Reasonable facilities are allowed under the provisions of this measure.  I have grave doubts as to the wisdom of licensing clubs at all.  I do not suggest that drastic measures should be taken to prevent the licensing of clubs, but I have very grave doubts of the wisdom   of that practice.  If men cannot come together for social enjoyment without feeling compelled to purchase intoxicating drink I think there is very little to be said for them.  I have yet to find a club, and it is not a popular club, I am sure, where refreshments, other than intoxicating drinks, are supplied.  If the supply of drink at clubs is purely as refreshments, that is a genuine reason, but one would naturally think that other forms of refreshment would sometimes be substituted. We know that that is not the case.  I do not pretend for a moment to be in favour of total abstinence.  I believe in reasonable facilities being provided for reasonable refreshment. I do not believe in anything more than that.  We heard one or two Deputies saying, and we have often heard it outside, that you cannot make people sober by Act of Parliament.  Even people who use that argument here will readily vote for the sections prohibiting illicit distillation, and dealing with methylated spirits.  They believe that you can prevent the abuses under that head by Act of Parliament.  I hold that you can equally prevent, by Act of Parliament, the other abuses which, undoubtedly, occur under other heads. 
     As the section dealing with mixed trading stands in the Bill, I cannot support it, not because I do not agree with the principle, but, as Deputy Heffernan stated, because I think it would be an undue hardship on people at present engaged in that business.  There is also the fact that the construction of very many of these houses makes it almost impossible to make the structural alterations suggested in the Bill.  That does not say that the principle is not a good one.  It is a good one, and, I think, something might certainly be done on the lines suggested by Deputy Corish; that some kind of temporary partition of the place where drink is sold should, as far as is reasonable, be insisted upon.  In a great many cases, I believe that could, and should, be done.  The suggestion made by Deputy Johnson, that longer time should be given than is suggested in the Bill for making these alterations, is also one that I think the Minister might consider. I think that no new licences should be granted in future to any   houses in which mixed trading is carried on.  That should be insisted upon. In the remodelling of houses, and in cases where transfers of licences are applied for, perhaps, it would be possible to insist that some such provision as this would be inserted in the Bill. As I said in the beginning, I think the Bill is a reasonable attempt, and no more than reasonable, to bring about better conditions in the sale of intoxicating liquor. 
    
      
       I move that the sitting be suspended until 7.15. 
       Agreed. 
       Sitting suspended at 6.30 p.m. and resumed at 7.15 p.m.,  AN CEANN COMHAIRLE  in the Chair. 
    
    
      
       This Bill has been rather fully discussed, and I am wondering what was the net effect left on the mind of the average Deputy by the discussion.  In a matter of this kind I am not claiming to be unbiassed or unprejudiced. I am naturally prejudiced in favour of this set of provisions which I bring forward after very full investigation of the subject, and after very full inquiry of all channels available to me, but I am asking myself the question as to what exactly is the net effect left on the mind of the Deputy who is not placed as I am, and who has listened here in the last few days to the discussion on this Bill.  Certainly the effect left in my mind is that the discussion shows how very, very little of substance, how little of pith or reality can be urged against the set of provisions and the proposals which the Bill contains.  Some Deputies spoke, quite obviously, not having read the Bill or even the explanatory memorandum which is prefixed.  There is a rather striking unanimity on two parts of the Bill&mdash;Part 4, dealing with illicit distillation, and Part 5, dealing with methylated spirits.  I think one would be justified in drawing from that the conclusion that we have in the Dail no Deputy who has fallen a victim either to poteen or methylated spirits, and so far as it goes that is eminently satisfactory. There was not anything like unanimity with regard to the other   three parts&mdash;Part 1, dealing with the question of hours; Part 2, of a rather general nature, and Part 3, embodying certain regulations with regard to clubs. 
       Deputies will find in the memorandum, and I think it natural to refer to it again, the exact changes proposed with regard to hours.  On week days, other than Saturdays, the existing hours are from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. in cities and towns with a population over 5,000, and elsewhere in the country from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.  That means really that for the greater part of the country on these week days the proposed hour of closing is not any earlier than the existing hour of closing.  Its real effect is an alteration of one hour, in cities and towns with a population of over 5,000.  When Deputies start slinging adjectives about, and waxing rhetorical it is always well for some one to bring them back to actual facts, and the actual proposals, and I am going to go through this memorandum briefly. As I say, that is the effect on weekdays other than Saturdays&mdash;an earlier closing by one hour.  On Saturdays what is the effect?  The existing hours are from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. in towns and cities with a population of over 5,000, and from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. elsewhere, so that the result of the proposal in the Bill will be that cities and towns with a population of over 5,000 will close half an hour earlier than under the existing law, and elsewhere in the country there is an extension of half an hour.  On Sundays there is no change except the change referred to lower down in the memorandum, namely, that during the period from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. drink may not be sold. On the Committee Stage if any Deputy has the hardihood to put down an amendment dealing with that I am prepared to discuss it very fully.  I think it is an admirably proper provision and a provision that the members of any and every church in the country should agree with&mdash;that these morning hours in which Divine Service takes place in the various churches ought to be hours in which the public houses would not be open for the sale or consumption of intoxicating liquor. 
    
     With regard to those days in which complete closing is proposed, there   again, there can be discussion.  On Good Friday, of course, I think there will be very little comment or controversy. There was always complete closing on Christmas day, so that there is no change in regard to that.  Any little comment there was turned on the question of St. Patrick's Day.  There are two points of view there.  Many people in the country hold the view which extended for a long time back that there ought to be complete closing on St. Patrick's Day if only as a matter of sentiment.  Deputies have said that drunkenness is not prevalent in the country at the moment.  If it is agreed that there was a time when drunkenness was prevalent in the country then a complete closing of licensed premises on the National Festival would at any rate, mark the turning of backs on such a state of affairs and give some expression to that sentiment which we all mouth freely enough, that we are in favour of a sober and temperate country and that we have no future along any other path.  The number of Deputies who managed to combine strong temperance views with an advocacy of unlimited facilities for drinking, rather surprised me and disappointed me in this debate. 
     We are told that drunkenness is not prevalent in the country.  That, of course, is a question of standards.  It is somewhat a relative question.  In the course of the year 1923 there were arrested in the metropolitan area for drunkenness 674 men and 734 women, a total of 1,408 persons.  That marks an increase on the year 1921 of 150 arrests.  Now there is drunkenness and drunkenness, and Deputies know that the Metropolitan Police, in practice, only make arrests for drunkenness where a person is obviously incapable of taking care of himself and making his way home in safety.  Yet in the last year there were 1,408 arrests for drunkenness in the Metropolitan Police area.  In the month of May in the current year there were 137 arrests as compared with 150 in April. 
     Deputies may have their own points of view about these figures as to whether they are good, bad or indifferent, but I do submit that, remembering that arrests are only made of persons obviously incapable of looking   after themselves, those figures reflect badly on the sobriety of the city. There are stages of drunkenness.  I saw somewhere that a person is only theologically drunk when he is in that condition that he would go to light his pipe at a tap.  You can take it that those arrests are arrests of people who would very nearly go to light their pipes at a tap.  Deputies should be quite clear on the question of restrictions and hours as to the exact effect of the proposals.  If they keep that in mind we should have an end of the extravagant language used in the Second Reading of the Bill.  Moving on to Part II. of the Bill, you had a few sections on which there was some slight comment.  You had Section 8.  Very little exception was taken to Section 7. I am aware of the views that exist about Section 8.  You have on one side the picture of the working man coming home to his dinner, his wife busy preparing and laying his dinner for him, and his son or daughter of fourteen or fifteen years of age being sent out for a pint of porter or a bottle of stout. That is one aspect of the thing.  Some Deputies spoke to me about that section, and from the trend of what they had to say I gathered that the objection lay in the possibility of children taking some of the liquor on the way back between the shop and the home. I do not think that that is the objection of the temperence people.  It is not what I gathered from them.  I think the objection is to familiarising growing boys or girls with a public house. They get to know the habits and the lie of the place, and when the boy of 14, 15 or 16 grows into a youth of 18 or 19 he will go there on his own business where he formerly went on his father's business.  I think that is the gist of the objection, and it is for Deputies, when we come to consider this section more in detail, to weigh well whether there is substance or reality in that objection. 
     I think Deputy McGoldrick is the only Deputy who took strong exception to Section 10, which deals with the consumption of liquor on premises which are only licensed for consumption off the premises.  Deputy McGoldrick thinks that is harsh, and that when people have been granted a particular   kind of licence on condition that they will sell only for consumption off the premises, it is a great hardship that when those conditions are thrown to the winds, smashed and trampled upon, there should be a removal of the licence. That is a matter of opinion, too.  I do not know whether many Deputies will share Deputy McGoldrick's opinion on that matter.  It seems to me that when the conditions are broken the only and obvious remedy is the withdrawal and forfeiture of the licence.  Coming, then, to Section 12, Deputies had, of course, as I expected, a great deal to say about Section 12, and will, no doubt, in further stages of the Bill have a great deal to say.  I am not objecting to that.  On the contrary, it is a section that would need very full consideration and discussion. I have my own strong and definite views, and because I wish to put those views to the Dail I have left that section in the Bill, although I am assured that it is not a section which meets with the approval of the Party which supports the Government.  I am in the position that I will simply put that section to an open vote of the Dail. It is a matter that has more aspects than one.  I stressed some of the aspects on speaking previously on this Bill.  I think the public are entitled to be served other than in this manner at this hour of the day.  I think people who are carrying on this business have done well enough out of the public to justify the public in demanding that there shall be a change for the future. 
     Remember, this is all on a basis of service to the community, and the community is, I submit, entitled to take this stand, that they shall be served somewhat differently in the future, that their children, boys and girls, going in on household messages, shall not be in the position of having to go in through beershops.  Then there is the other point of view, the point of view of the temptation to the man of the house himself, going in on household messages&mdash;that there should be some little partition, some separation, so that if he were to decide to have a drink that would be a decision rather   than simply a yielding to irresistible impulse or temptation.  There is still another aspect, and it is this; that the previous administration here, the British administration, simply dealt out licences through the country in a very reckless and very haphazard manner, with very little consideration of the real interests of the country and of the people of the country.  That is admitted upon all sides.  It is admitted by the traders themselves.  No one contends that 15,000 public houses are needed for the reasonable refreshment of the Irish people, and there is a further result.  It is not merely the question of the superfluity of public houses.  You have all through the country this system of one business eking out the other, and it has been contended time after time, that neither can survive alone.  What does that point to?  If it is true, it simply means that you have in this country an utterly unsound economic position; that back through the last twenty, thirty or forty years there has been a steady multiplication of middlemen out of all proportion to the real requirements of the citizens.  There is much talk of profiteering and the high cost of living. 
     Deputies should try to get down to the pith of the matter.  You can have very high prices and profiteering in the technical sense without anyone making huge fortunes out of it.  Take the average town or village in Ireland depending for its business on a catchment area of a four or five mile radius, and what is the picture?  Dotted from one of the main streets to the other you have people dealing in substantially the same commodities.  They all have to live on that catchment area, a rural area, a four or five mile radius. The moral is obvious.  The talk of competition is a myth, a fiction.  Prices are ruled for the weakest link in the chain, and yet Deputies say that it is not right to say that the public are entitled to be better or differently served in the future than they have been in the past.  If you say there must be separation between one portion of a shop and another you are saying something that is harsh, unjust, and confiscatory in its effect.  Licences were dealt out in a reckless, haphazard   fashion here by the British administration, and it is that situation we are facing to-day.  Because one business was not sufficient another counter was opened and it was eked out with another business.  The net result is that you have had that multiplication of distributors, that multiplication of retailers, going on in the country, and all those must live on the producers. That is why producers are down at bedrock to-day fighting for their very existence. If we are only to tell the truth when it is palatable, and if we are only to tell the truth when we are quite sure we are not walking on anyone's corns, we are not going to get anywhere in dealing with the social and economic evils of the country. 
     Part 3 of the Bill deals with clubs. The proposal is that clubs shall not sell intoxicating liquor later than 10 p.m. on an ordinary week-day and 9.30 p.m. on Saturdays, and not between the hours of 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Sundays. That again, of course, has been branded as tyrannical in the extreme.  I have been charged with &ldquo;undue rigidity&rdquo; because I did not leave loopholes through which Deputy Figgis might slip in and out.  Reasonable refreshments we are told are denied to members of the clubs after 10 p.m.  Such liquids as water, tea, coffee or minerals do not count in the vocabulary of the clubmen, if we are to believe all that has been said here. 
    
      
       Especially golf clubmen. 
    
    
      
       It is not a harsh or tyrannical provision.  The point has been made that for a few weeks in summer golf may, with good sight and good luck, be played up to 9.30 p.m. or after it.  That is true, but you cannot base legislation on the circumstances that prevail for a week or two weeks on each side of the longest day.  Anyone that would set out to frame a measure by taking stock of special cases of that kind would not have much to congratulate himself on by the time he would be through.  The fact is&mdash; and everyone knows it&mdash;that if things went on as they have been going on, the tendency would be that these clubs would become less and less golf clubs and more and more just late-night   drinking dens, from which people would go home uproarious in the small hours of the morning. 
    
    
      
       They might not come home at all. 
    
    
      
       Killing Deputy Gorey's stock, maybe, with their motor-cars on the roadside on their way home.  On a Bill like this I much prefer the Committee Stage to the Second Reading.  On Second Reading people can get up and talk generalities in perfervid rhetoric and they have never to come down to the bedrock thing of saying what is exactly wrong or what the alternative should be.  I look forward with a certain zest and with certain pleasure to the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I want, for instance, Deputy Hall to put down amendments on the lines of the speech he made here this evening, which showed that he had not even read the first page of the memorandum which is prefixed to the Bill.  He spoke as if there were no such thing as  bona fide  traffic. 
    
    
      
       I did not make any such statement. 
    
    
      
       Or as if, by this Bill, it was proposed to abolish it. Staring him in the face, on the first page of the memorandum, were these words:&mdash; 
       Under the existing law  bona fide  travellers&mdash; 
       I presume the Deputy knows what that is&mdash; 
       may be lawfully served by publicans at any hour upon any day of the year. 
       Day there includes night.  The only restriction which the Bill imposes upon that latitude is that 
       
         Bona fide  travellers may not be served&mdash;(1) at any hour on Christmas Day, Good Friday, St. Patrick's Day; or (2) during the period 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., on Sunday. 
    
     Therefore, Deputy Hall's interesting travellers coming from 40 or 50 miles, with farm produce, tired and weary and, incidentally, thirsty and with their horses in the same condition, may knock up any wayside publican at 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning and   get reasonable refreshment for man if not for beast. 
    
      
       The system at the moment is not as the Minister explained. The public house owners have not to be knocked up. 
    
    
      
       As I said, in connection with this Bill, I had to take stock of many conflicting views, and I had conferences in which interests that were radically opposed were represented. My own considered opinion is that, of all the interests that were represented, the people who have the most real grievance with the provisions of this Bill are the temperance advocates. That is simply because they have to face the fact that, unfortunately, they are ahead of the country, ahead of the times, ahead of the electorate and of the representatives of the electorate.  But to brand this Bill as a harsh measure or a sweeping infringement of anybody's rights, is simply absurd.  When subjected to any kind of scrutiny or any kind of analysis, it is no such thing.  It is as moderate and as mild a measure of reform on this question, which clamours for reform, as any Minister in my position could conscientiously bring forward. Other questions were mentioned which are not dealt  in the Bill, but certainly this year I want to see a commission set up that will get to grips with many bigger questions that the Bill does not purport to deal with; that will get to grips with this question of the enormous excess of licensed establishments in the country to the real requirements of the people, and that will consider such special local problems as may be found to exist&mdash; the problem, for instance, in Cork, where you have these tied houses.  The   Terms of Reference of such a commission ought to be drafted as broadly as possible, to permit of the commission making any representations to the Government which they might think fit to make in connection with this traffic which plays an admittedly important part in the life of the country.  Deputies who advocated and urged the immediate setting up of this commission ought not to quote that intention as a sufficient reason for doing nothing at all in face of the situation which confronts us.  A commission of that kind might take five or six months or perhaps more on its work.  By the time a Bill would be brought forward here for the consideration of the Dail and Seanad it might be as long again.  All this Bill purports to do is to deal with certain matters which call for immediate attention, pending a fuller investigation of the whole question by a competent commission.  In Committee I am prepared to give reasonable consideration to such amendments as may be put down.  Certainly, every amendment put down will be closely considered, but I am going to make no extravagant promises, no promises that will creat in Deputies' minds the idea that the Bill, as it stands, is something in the nature of a try-on and that we are prepared to throw out a lot of ballast in Committee.  Certain minor matters may be discussed and may be more fully considered but, substantially, the Bill is as mild and as moderate a measure as could be sponsored by any responsible Minister.  If there is anything big asked for, or anything big pressed for, then I would sooner the whole Bill should go overboard than that it should be nullified by amendments to sections which do not bear amendment.

     Motion declared carried.  Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, July 2nd. 
    
      
       Will that be before or after the adjournment? 
    
    
      
       I could not answer that question. 
    
    
      
       When are amendments to be in by? 
    
    
      
       Monday. 
    
   
   
     INTOXICATING LIQUOR BILL, 1924 (SECOND STAGE). - AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE (EGGS) BILL, 1924.&mdash;FIFTH STAGE. 
    
      
       I move the following amendment:&mdash; 
       In page 2, Section 2, line 19, to delete the word &ldquo;words&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the word &ldquo;expression.&rdquo; The section would then read: &ldquo;the expression Minister means the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.&rdquo; 
       That, at least, will be good grammar. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
    
    
      
       I also move the following amendment:&mdash; 
       In page 3, Section 4 (1) (d), line 53, after the words &ldquo;intended for&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;export,&rdquo; and in line 54 to delete the comma after the word &ldquo;being.&rdquo; 
       That is merely a verbal amendment. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill, as amended, do now pass&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
    
    
      
       A message will be sent to the Seanad accordingly. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - CRIMINAL JUSTICE (EVIDENCE) BILL, 1924.&mdash;THIRD STAGE. 
     Sections 1 to 5 put and agreed to. 
     SECTION 6. 
     This Act may be cited as the Criminal Justice (Evidence) Act, 1924. 
    
      
       I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash; 
    
     
        To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
     &ldquo;(2)  This Act shall come into force on such day as the Minister for Justice shall by order appoint.&rdquo; 
     It will be necessary that some time should elapse between the date upon which the Bill passes into law and the time when it comes into operation. 
     Amendment agreed to. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 6, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     Schedule and Title agreed to. 
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - DAIL RESUMES. 
     Bill reported with one amendment. Fourth Stage ordered for Friday, June 27th. 
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - CRIMINAL JUSTICE (ADMINISTRATION) BILL, 1924.&mdash;THIRD STAGE. 
     Sections 1 to 9 agreed to. 
     SECTION 10. 
     It shall not be necessary in stating any intent to defraud, deceive or injure, to state an intent to defraud, deceive or injure any particular person where the statute creating the offence does not make an intent to defraud, deceive or injure a particular person an essential ingredient of the offence. 
    
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       Before section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       The oath to be administered to the jurors empanelled to try the issue as to whether a prisoner who stands mute is mute of malice or by the visitation of God shall be in the following form, that is to say:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;I do swear by Almighty God that I will well and truly try whether A.B., the prisoner at the bar, is mute of malice or by the visitation of God and a true verdict give according to the evidence.&rdquo; 
    
     It is necessary the form of oath should be in the Bill.  That is for the purpose of dealing with cases in which a man alleges he is dumb and in which a jury is sworn to try whether he is really   dumb or is only pretending he is. 
     New section agreed to, and added to the Bill. 
    
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       At the trial of a prisoner on indictment at the prosecution of the Attorney-General of Saorstat Eireann a  nolle prosequi  may be entered at the instance of the Attorney-General of Saorstat Eireann at any time after the indictment is preferred to the jury and before a verdict is found thereon, and every such  nolle prosequi  shall be in the following form, that is to say:&mdash; 
       On the.........day of............... 19......., at the trial of A.B. on the prosecution of the Attorney-General of Saorstat Eireann on an indictment for........................................ ......................the said Attorney-General in his proper person (or by his counsel) stated to the court that he would not further prosecute the said A.B. on the said indictment, whereupon it was ordered by the court that the said A.B. be discharged of and from the indictment aforesaid. 
       This is necessary because of the abolition of the Grand Jury that the new procedure of indictment should be followed when this Bill becomes law. 
       New section agreed to, and added to the Bill. 
    
    
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       Every recognisance entered into by way of bail before a District Justice or a Justice of the District Court shall be in the following form, that is to say:&mdash; 
    
     Be it remembered that on the .....................day of ............... in the year of our Lord................ A.B., of .................. (labourer), C.D., of ................. (grocer), and E.F., of ................. (butcher), personally came before me the undersigned, a District Justice in Saorstat Eireann (or a Justice of the District Court of Saorstat Eireann) for the District of....................and severally acknowledged to themselves to owe to Saorstat Eireann the   several sums following; that is to say, the said A.B. the sum of ...................., and the said C.D. and E.F. the sum of ................... each, to be made and levied of their several goods and chattels, lands and tenements respectively, to the use of the Minister for Finance of Saorstat Eireann, if he the said A.B. fail in the conditions endorsed.  Taken and acknowledged the day and year first above mentioned, at............... ............... before me, .............. 
     The condition of the within-written recognizance is such, that whereas the said A.B. was this day charged before me, the Justice within mentioned for that (etc., as in the warrant); if, therefore, the said A.B. will appear at the next sitting of the Circuit District Court (or of the Circuit Court, or of the High Court or of the Central Criminal Court, as the case may be) to be holden in and for the District (or as the case may be) and there surrender himself into the custody of the keeper of the (common gaol) there, and plead to such indictment as may be preferred against him by the Attorney-General of Saorstat Eireann, and take his trial upon the same, and not depart the said Court without leave, then the said recognizance to be void, or else to stand in full force and virtue. 
     This new section is also necessary because of alterations following on the passing of the Courts of Justice Act, and Section 9 of the present Bill under which criminal charges should be prosecuted by the Attorney-General.  It proposes that recognizances should be entered into by way of bail. 
     New section agreed to, and added to the Bill. 
    
      
       I wonder would the Minister be able to give us some enlightenment as to why, in these illustrations, the direction should be labourer, grocer or butcher?  Why not lawyer or publican? 
    
    
      
       Or tinker or tailor? 
       Sections 10 and 11 put, and agreed to. 
       SECTION 12. 
    
     Nothing in these rules or in any   rules made under section two of this Act shall affect the provisions of sub-section (4) of section 32 of the Children Act, 1908. 
    
      
       I move the following amendment:&mdash; 
       To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(3)  This Act shall come into force on such day as the Minister for Justice shall be order appoint.&rdquo; 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
       FIRST SCHEDULE. 
       Form 21. 
       STATEMENT OF OFFENCE. 
       Perjury, contrary to section 1 (1) of the Perjury Act, 1911. 
       PARTICULARS OF OFFENCE. 
       A.B., on the day of, in the county of being a witness upon the trial of an action in the High Court of Justice in Saorstat Eireann, in which one, was plaintiff, and one was defendant, knowingly, falsely swore that he saw one M.N. in the street called Dame Street, Dublin, on the day of 
    
    
      
       I beg to move the following amendment: 
       In the appendix to rules, form of indictment, to delete the whole of form 21, page 10, lines 42 to 45 inclusive, as above. 
       The reason for that is that prosecutions for perjury in the Saorstat are not brought under the Perjury Act of 1911. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
       First Schedule, as amended, agreed to and added to the Bill. 
       Second Schedule agreed to and added to the Bill. 
       THE TITLE. 
       &ldquo;An Act to amend the law relating to Indictments in Criminal Cases and matters incidental or similar thereto.&rdquo; 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That this be the Title of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - DAIL RESUMES. 
     Bill reported with amendments. 
     Fourth Stage ordered for Friday, June 27th. 
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - LOCAL ELECTIONS POSTPONEMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL, 1924.&mdash;SECOND STAGE. 
     
    
      
       I move that the Order be discharged and the Bill be put down again for to-morrow. 
       Question put, and agreed to. 
    
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - ESTIMATES. 
    
      
       It has been suggested to me that it might be as well not to take the Estimates this evening, and to begin them after question time to-morrow. I am agreeable to go on, but if there is a desire to that effect, I think it might be as well to take them after questions to-morrow. 
    
    
      
       I think it is quite evident Deputies are not ready to proceed with the Estimates to-night. 
    
    
      
       The   Minister suggests that they should be taken after question time to-morrow. The Order Paper for to-morrow contains: The Telephone Capital Bill, The Trade Loans Guarantee Bill, The Fisheries (Election of Conservators Postponement) Bill, and The Military Service Pensions Bill, all in the Second Stage, and, in addition, the Local Elections Postponement (Amendment) Bill, which is also in the Second Stage.  This is really the only one that stands in the way. 
    
    
      
       It is a Bill on which there will be considerable discussion, I imagine. 
    
    
      
       As this Bill has lost its place I certainly would take the Estimates before it to-morrow. 
    
    
      
       I move that the Dail do now adjourn. 
       Question put, and agreed to. 
       The Dail adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Wednesday, 25th June. 
    
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - KILKELLY PRE-TRUCE CLAIM. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he is yet in a position to say if a decision has been come to in the matter of the claim made by Vincent Fraine, of Kilkelly, Co. Mayo, on account of personal injuries received during the British regime, and whether in view of the fact that Mr. Fraine has been rendered unfit for work as a result of the injuries sustained he will take steps to have the settlement of his claim expedited. 
    
    
      
       The application referred to by the Deputy will be listed for hearing at an early date by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee during the course of their next sittings at a centre in County Mayo. 
    
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - A GORT PRE-TRUCE CLAIM. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether any decision has yet been come to on the claim of Mr. Thomas Kiggins, of Derreen, Gort, Co. Galway, for compensation for injuries received from British Forces in June, 1921; and, if an award has been made, how soon can payment of same be made. 
    
    
      
       No application by the person named by the Deputy has been made to the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee.  The Committee were informed that a claim for personal injuries had been lodged with the Compensation (Ireland) Commission,   and on the 14th April last a form of application was sent to the solicitor acting for Mr. Kiggins.  This form has not been returned to the Committee. 
    
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - KINVARA PRE-TRUCE CLAIM. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether the award of £50 made to Mr. Pat Hynes, of Dungara, Kinvara, Co. Galway, on 3rd February last, on account of farm buildings destroyed by British Forces has yet been paid, and, if not, whether he will see that this account is immediately settled. 
    
    
      
       As no award by the Compensation Commission has yet been received in my Department in the case referred to by the Deputy the question of payment does not arise.  It has been ascertained that the claim is under investigation, and it is hoped to dispose of it at an early date. 
    
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - A BALLYHAUNIS ARMY ACCOUNT. 
    
      
       asked the Minister for Defence whether he has received a claim from Mr. Patrick Byrne, general merchant, Bridge Street, Ballyhaunis, Co. Mayo, for £104 1s. 3d. for goods supplied to members of the National Forces during the latter part of 1922; whether the claim has yet been investigated, and, if so, with what result, and if he will state how soon the claimant may hope to have a decision on the matter. 
    
    
      
       Mr. Byrne's claim has been received, and is at present being investigated on the spot by an officer who has been specially detailed from Headquarters for the purpose of clearing up this and other outstanding accounts in the same neighbourhood.
