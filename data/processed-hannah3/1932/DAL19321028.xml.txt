       Tri chead (300) lion na scoltach a bhi ag obair faoi Bhrainnse an MheanOideachais ins an bhliadhain 1930-31, agus is ionann sin agus 6 scoil sa bhreis ar uimhir na bliadhna roimh re.  Is e sin an meadu is mo in aon bhliadhain amhain o cuireadh an Roinn ar bun. Bhi 1,349 de bhiseach ins an tinnreamh, agus is e sin e an biseach tinnrimh is mo da dtainig i mbliadhain ar bith ar na mallaibh.  I dtaoibh na scoltach a raibh an Ghaedhilg i bhfeidhm mar gnath-theangaidh teagaisg ionnta bhi 3 scoltacha sa bhreis ar lion na bliadhna roimh re agus bhi 4 scoltacha sa bhreis in ar teagascadh cuid de na habhair, trid an Ghaedhilg.  Ta a thuilleadh socruighthe deanta ag an Roinn le cuidiu le scoltacha Gaedhilge agus le scoltacha Dha-Theangthacha a chur chun cinn. 
     
     (a)  Riaradh le n-ar feidir scoil Ghaedhilge (Roinn A) a dheanamh de phairt de Mhean-Scoil ar bith ata ar   bun faoi lathair, ach amhain go mbeidh oiread daltai ag freastal na scoile sin agus gur fiu an costas an riaradh seo a chur i bhfeidhm innte. Is e an fath a ndearnadh an socru seo le suil go reidhteochadh se an bealach do lucht stiurtha MeanScoil ar mhian leo feidhim a bhaint as an nGaedhilg mar ghleas teagaise, ach nar eirigh leo sin a dheanamh cheana, de bhrigh go rabh cuid de na daltai narbh fheidir leo an sochar ceart a bhaint as a leitheid sin de theagasc. 
     (b)  Rata na ndeontaisi a ardu i geasanna airithe. 
     (c)  Deontas sa bhreis d'ioc le scoltacha beaga i gcasanna fa leith; agus 
     (d)  Breis speisialta paighe do thabhairt do mhuinteoiri a dheanfas na h-abhair leighinn a theagasc thrid an nGaedhilg. 
     Ta athas orm a radh nach e amhain go dtainig meadu ar lion na scoltach agus ar lion na ndaltai, ach go dtainig feabhas ar obair na scoltach ina chuideachta sin.  Ni h-e amhain gur mheaduigh lion na n-iarratoir i gcoitchinne, ach ins an Scrudu deir-eannach le haghaidh Teistimeireacht leanadh do'n ardu buan a bhi ag teacht ins an meid faoi'n gcead de phasanna agus de phasanna le honoracha a ghnothuighthear ins na scruduighthe sin.  An uimhir fa'n gcead de iarratoiri a gheibh Onoracha, ta si anois i bhfoisceacht do bheith dha uair comh mor agus bhi si sa bhliadhan 1925, an chead bhliadhain ar bunuigheadh na scruduighthe ar an Chlar Nua.  Is tabhachtach an fhiadhnaise i seo ar an doigh a ndeachaidh na scoltacha ar aghaidh da gcur fein in oireamhaint don obair faoi an nua-riaradh.  Gidh go bhfuiltear sasta i gcoitchinne leis an gClar Nua, feictear duinn go bhfeadfaidhe a thuilleadh saoirse a cheadu ann, agus gan a luachmhair-eacht a laghdu.  Da bhrigh sin ta se de run ag an Roinn Ard-Chursai agus Bun-Chursai a leagan amach in abhair Matamaitice agus in abhair a bhaineas le teangthacha.  Tathar ag suil go geuirfear suim i stuidear na Matamai-tice i scoltacha na gcailin de bharr an Bhun-Chursa ins an abhar leighinn sin;   agus de bharr an Bhun-Chursa ins na Nua-Theangthacha go gcuirfear breis suime i leightheoracht Frainncise agus Gearmanaise ins na scoltacha in nach feidir am go leor a fhaghail le haghaidh an lan-chursa ata ann fa lathair. I dtaoibh an Bhun-Chursa i Mata-maitice do scoltacha na gcailin, agus an Ard-Chursa agus an Bhun-Chursa i nGaedhilg agus i mBearla, tathar ag suil le n-a gcur i bhfeidhm, an scoil-bhliadhain seo chugainn.  Agus tathar ag suil leis na Bhun-Chursai i bhFrainncis agus i nGearmanais a chur i bhfeidhm ins an bhliadhain 1933-34. 
     I dteannta an fhais a thainig ins na bliadhanta deireannacha seo ar lion na scoltach agus na mac leighinn, ta fas da reir sa mheid airgid a caithtear ar Mhean-Oideachas, go h-aithrid maidir le Deontaisi Cionn-tsraithe (Capitation Grants) agus deontaisi eile.  Ta an caiteachas no an costas iomlan (lasmuich de chostas Riarachain, Cigireachta, clodorachta agus Paipearachais) le haghaidh na bliadhna airgeadais seo caithte (dar crioch 31adh Marta, 1932), ta se £17,000 nios mo na an costas a bhi ann le haghaidh na bliadhna roimhe sin. Do reir na gcuntaisi a fuarthas o na scoltacha i dtus na scoil-bhliadhna 1931-32, bhi an fas in uimhir na scoltacha agus na mac leighinn ag gabhail ar aghaidh.  Is doiche mar sin de, ma's mian leanamhaint de na deontaisi ar an tsean-leagan go mbeidh ardu eile £20,000 no mar sin, ar chostas Mean-Oideachais le h-agh-aidh na bliadhna airgeadais 1932-33. Ce bith sin, bhi se riachtanach laghdu a dheanamh ar chursai airgeadais i gcoitchinne, agus mar sin de bhi se de riachtanas fuagradh a thabhairt do na scoltacha go laghdoch-aidhe deontaisi Ceann-tsraithe agus deontaisi Saotharlainne (Laboratory) na scoil-bhliadhna 1931-32 fa dheich sa chead (10%), agus go measfaidhe deontaisi na scoltach Gaedhilge agus deontaisi na scoltach Dha-Theang-thach ata bunuighthe ar an deontas Ceann-tsraithe, go measfaidhe iad sin de reir meid laghduighthe an deontais Ceann-tsraithe. 
     I dtaobh foirneacha na scoltach bhi 2,643 oidi ag obair ins an scoil-bhliadh-ain   1930-31, agus b'ionann sin agus 92 sa bhreis, no 3.6% sa bhreis, ar uimhir na bliadhna roimh re.  Bhi 1,491 de mhuinteoiri claruighthe ag obair&mdash;16 sa bhreis, no 1.1%. 
     Taisbeanann na figiuiri sin, gidh gurb oth linn a radh, go rabh lion na muinteoir claruighthe beagan nios lugha na mar bhi se ins an bhliadhain roimhe sin.  B'fheairrde, de thaoibh oideachais, go mbeadh nios mo de oidi claruighthe ar fhoirneacha na scoltach. 
     Ach ta meadu ag teacht ar lion na muinteoir ata ag tarraingt Paighe Breise (Incremental Salary).  Ta siad anois 81.1% de iomlan na muinteoiri claruighthe.  80.5% a bhi siad ann ins an bhliadhain 1929-30, agus 78.7% ins an bhliadhain 1928-29.  Ta athas orm go bhfuil laghdu ag teacht bliadhain ar bhliadhain ar lion na muinteoiri a gheobhadh paighe on Stat ach munab e go bhfuil siad de bharraidheacht ar na foirne ata ceaduighthe do na scoltacha a bhfuil siad ag obair ionnta. 
     Maidir le pinseanna Muinteoiri na Mean-Scol ta an Sceim i dtaobh Aois-liuntaisi do Mhuinteoiri Mean-scoile i bhfeidhm on chead la de Lughnasa, 1929, agus se'n meid pinseann a deonadh go dti an 31adh la de Mharta anuraidh 53 pinseanna maraon le 4 cinn a deonadh mar gheall ar dhroch-shlainte. Ta beagnach 1,300 muin-teoiri claruithe ag obair i Mean-Scoileanna agus diobh seo tagann timcheall's 460 faoi'n Sceim.  Muin-teoiri tuatha seadh beagnach 90% de sna baill. 
     Ni raibh cuid de na hiarrathoiri ionghlactha faoi'n sceim mar gheall ar gur theip ortha ceann amhain no nios mo de sna coinniollacha a ceapadh a cholionadh.  Do theip ar an gcuid is mo aca seo i ngeall ar nar cholion siad an coinniol a d'eiligh&mdash; 
     (a)  gur ghadh, i gcas iarrathoir a bhi os cionn 30 mbliana d'aois an chead la de Lughnasa, 1929, nar lugha an tseirbhis cheaduithe mhuinteoir-eachta a bhi aige na dha dtrian de bhreis na haoise a bhi aige an t-am sin ar 25 bliana, agus 
     (b)  i gcas iarrathoir a bhi os cionn 50 bliain d'aois ar an gcead la de   Lughnasa, 1929, go mbeadh ar a sheirbhis cheaduithe seacht mbliana ar a laighead de sna deich mbliana direach roimh an data san. 
     Do breathnuigheadh isteach in sna casanna seo go curamach agus tathar tar eis Sceim Leasuchain d'ullamhu le hi do chur faoi bhraghaid an Oireach-tais agus leiseochaidh an sceim seo cruadhtan mor ar bith a thainig de bharr na coinniollacha ata luaidhte a chur i bhfeidhm. 
     Maidir le tuilleadh bun-oideachais a thabhairt do dhaoine oga na Gael-tachta ar fhagail na mbun-scoil doibh (Post Primary Education), ta an gno san freisin da bhreithniu againn.  Ta neithe ar siubhal cheana i bhfuirm sceim Scolaireachtai, a dheanfaidh, ta suil againn, tairbhe mhor don Fhior-Ghaeltacht agus a cuirfeas i gcumas do roinnt mac leighinn oideachas nios aoirde d'fhaghail.  Ni ceadmhach cur isteach ar na Scolaireachta seo d'aoinne ach do leanbhai a togadh ins na ceanntracha mar a bhfuil an Ghaedhilg 'na gnath-theangaidh ag furmhor na ndaoine, a bhfuil an Ghaedhilg ina gnath-theangaidh ins na tighthe a bhfuil siad ina gcomhnuidhe, agus, fos, a fuair a gcuid oideachais tre mheadhon na Gaedhilge fein.  Dha sceim scolaireachta ata ann le haghaidh na mac leighinn sin (1) chun Mean-Oideachas tre Ghaedhilg a sholathar in aisce dhoibh agus (2) chun cursa iomlan in Aon Ghne leighinn a chur ar faghail doibh san Iolscoil.  Mar aon leis na neithe sin ta socruithe nua deanta chun cursai &ldquo;roimh re&rdquo; do sholathar do leanbhai on Ghaeltacht agus chun roinnt ionad i gColaisti Ullmhuchain a chur ar leith doibh gach bliadhain. 
     Bronnfar ocht gcinn deag (18) de Scolaireachtai Mean-Scoile ar iarrath-oiri on bhFior-Ghaeltacht gach bliadhain, agus mairfidh gach scolaireacht aca sin ar feadh cheithre mbliadhan, agus cuid aca ar feadh chuig mbliadhan, ma mheastar sin bheith riachtanach.  De na 18 scolair-eachtai sin ni bhronnfar nios lugha na 9 gcinn ar chailini agus, gan briseadh ar an gcoingheall coscaithe sin, cuirfear uimhir airithe Scolaireachtai i leith iarrathoiri o gach priomh-cheanntar   den Fhior-Ghaeltacht.  Ar an gcuma seo ta beartuithe againn buaidh a fhaghail ar an easbhaidh bun-leighinn a d'fheadfadh bheith ar dhaoine oga o'n Ghaeltacht&mdash;easbhaidh a thiocfadh de staid economiceach na n-aiteach ata i gceist, agus a d'fhagfadh deacracht ar leith ar na daoine oga a sciar fein a fhaghail de na scolaireachta. 
     Ar feadh se seilbhe na Scolaireachta iocfaidh an Roinn Oideachais na taille scoile, agus ionnus nach mbac-faidh beag-ghustail a mhuinntire do aon mhac leighinn Scolaireacht a ghnothu bhearfar deontas le haghaidh gleas eadaigh, costaisi taistil, etc., i dtri coda gach bliadhain don mhac leighinn tre laimh stiurthoiri na scoile.  Ta solathar freisin da dheanamh chun congnamh airgid le haghaidh costaisi tinnrimh ar an scruduchan a ioc le gacha iarrathoir go mbeidh tuar foghantachta ina chuid freagrai agus chun duais a thabhairt d'oide na scoile o n-a dtiocfaidh gach iarrathoir go n-eireochaidh leis.  Ba choir go dtiocfadh de gach ais diobh san go raghadh feabhas ar an oideachas ins na ceanntrachaibh Gaedhealacha, lasmuich den tairbhe thiocfadh uatha do na mic leighinn fein a n-eireochadh leo. 
     Nuair bheidh an cursa Mean-Oideachais thart beidh caoi ag mac leighinn ag a bhfuil Scolaireachtai dul ag iomaidheacht ar son Scolaireachtai ata ceaptha ins an Iolscoil ag an Rialtas do mhic leighinn as an bhFior-Ghaeltacht, i bhfochair na Scolaireachtai sin ata ceaptha san Iolscoil ag na Comhairli Conndae. Agus fairis sin beidh cead ag cailini ag a bhfuil Scolaireachtai dul ag iomaidheacht ar son uimhir fa leith de shaor-ionadaibh i gColaiste Ullmhuchain ina muintear Obair Tighis. Da bhrigh sin, ni ion-choimeadta Mean-Scolaireachtai do chailini ach i scoltachai Roinn A amhain, se sin, scoltachai ina muintear Obair Tighis agus Ealadha, ar feadh a gcursa go hiomlan. 
     Foillsigheadh tuairisc ar na Scol-aireachtai sin o samhradh na bliadhna 1931, agus i dtreo go gcuirfi an Sceim i bhfeidhm gan mhoill do toghadh seisear cailini gur eirigh leo ins an   scrudu i gcoir Colaisti Ullmhuchain, ach nar eirigh leo glaodhach fhaghail chun aon cholaiste, agus do thosnuigh-eadar ar a gcursa Mean-Oideachais i Meadhon-Foghmhair, 1931. 
     Nil Scolaireachtai sin na Iolscoile ata ceaptha do mhie leighinn on nGaeltacht, nil siad in mo vota-sa mar is e Aire an Airgid a bhronnas iad ar mholadh Aire an Oideachais.  Ni bheidh na Scolaireachtai seo ion-ghnothuighthe ach ag iarrthoiri a togadh san bhFior-Ghaeltacht, mar ta leagtha amach cheana; agus caithfidh siad sin scrudu na hArd-Teistimeir-eacht bheith gnothuighthe le hOnoracha aca.  Is do Cholaiste na hOllscoile i nGaillimh ata na Scolaireachtai sin uile ceaptha, se sin, ma bhionn an cursa ata ag teastail on mac leighinn le fhagail aige ins an Cholaiste sin.  £110 sa bhliadhain luach gach scolaireacht diobh.  Iocfar £20 de sin nuair bronn-far an scolaireacht ar an mac leighinn; agus iocfar an chuid eile ina dhiolaidh-eachtai o am go ham, tre lucht ceannais na Iolscoile.  Is feidir na Scol-aireachtai d'ath-bhronnadh o bhliadhain go bliadhain go dti go mbeidh tamall reasunta fachta ag an mac leighinn chun a cheim do gnothu. 
     Tathar ag suil go ndeanfai an comh-cheangal seo idir Scolaireachtai Mean-Scoile agus Iol-scoile le haghaidh mac leighinn on Ghaeltacht i dteannta na scolaireachtai don Ghaeltacht fein a bhronnas Colaiste na hIol-scoile i nGaillimh, go ndeanfaidh se a chur in airithe go mbeidh neart de chainnteoiri duthchais a mbeidh oideachas maith ortha ar faghail le haghaidh muinteoireachta i mean-scol-tacha, agus i gceard-scoltacha, etc. (Post Primary Schools.) 
     Maidir leis  an nGaedhilg sna Mean-Scoileanna  ta eolas maith no cuibhea-sach maith ar an nGaedhilg ag an gcuid is mo de na daoine ata gha muineadh ins na mean-sgoileanna fa lathair, agus ta daoine ortha go mba dheacair iad do sharu in eolas ar an dteangain, i nduthracht oibre, no i gclisteacht muinteoireachta. Ta feabhas ag dul ar mhuineadh na litridheachta agus na filidheachta in aghaidh na bliadhna, agus leigheann na sgolairi de ghnath nios mo leabhra na mar a dheinidis. Ni hannamh anois cnuasach maith de   leabhraibh Gaedhilge ar faghail i leabharlainn sgoile agus leas da bhaint asta ag na daltai. 
     Ar a shon san is uile, ni misde tagairt do roinnt neithe ata ag baint de thairbhe an teagaisg. 
     (i)  Nil ach fir-bheagan de sna muin-teoiri ina geainnteoiri duthchais, agus ta cuid mhaith de na muin-teoiri eile na bionn de thaithighe aca ar labhairt na teangan ach an meid a labhraid leis na ranganna sgoile, agus na faghann aon chaoi ar dhul don Ghaeltacht na ar bheith ag eisteacht le cainnteoiri maithe.  Ni hiongnadh an easbhaidh taithighe bheith ag cur meath is meirg i ndiaidh a cheile ar an nGaedhilg ag a lan de na muinteoiri, go mor mhor ar an urlabhra, agus an fhoghrui-dheacht do bheith lochtach is neamh-chruinn aca i ndeire na dala.  Na daoine a bhfuil an sgeal mar sin-aca gheobhaidis a bheag no a mhor de chabhair fhaghail o sna ceirnini gramafoin no o bheith ag eisteacht leis an gcraobhsgaoileachan. 
     (ii)  Deabhruigheann an sgeal go bhfuil cuid maith muinteoiri oga ag teacht amach as na hIolsgoileanna, ceimeanna sa Ghaedhilg&mdash;go fiu Ceimeanna Onoracha&mdash;bainte amach aca, agus gan an cumas comhraidh na an liomhthacht cainnte aca a chuirfeadh ar a n-acfuinn labhairt na teangan do mhuineadh go ceart.  Ni bhionn fuaimeanna na Gaedhilge sathach cruinn aca agus ta de chos-mhalacht ar chuid aca nach mor an cleachtadh a rinneadar ar labhairt na teangan le linn doibh bheith san Iolsgoil.  Ina fhochair sin, ni bhionn moran leighte aca taobh amuigh den mheid ata riachtanach i gcoir na sgruduithe Iolsgoile, agus tagann de sin go dteipeann ortha suim is speis i Litridheacht na Gaedhilge do mhus-gailt ins na daltai a bhionn fa na gcuram. 
     (iii)  Is mion minic a cloistear gearain i dtaobh a laighead Gaedhilge a bhionn ag na daltai oga ag teacht isteach ins na mean - sgoileanna dhoibh.  Ba ghnath a mhillean san do leagadh ar na sgoileanna priomhaid-eacha na baineann leis an Roinn   Oideachais.  Ach de bhrigh go bhfuil breis is deich n-oiread sgolairi ar na mean-sgoileanna is ta ar na sgoileanna priomhaideacha san is leir nar cheart ach cuid bheag den mhillean do chur ortha siud.  Is fior, ach go hairithe, go bhfeadfi abhfad nios mo a dheanamh ar son na Gaedhilge ins na mean-sgoileanna, da mbeadh an t-eolas ceart ar an dteangain agus an taithighe cheart ar a labhairt ag na daltai oga ag teacht isteach doibh. 
     Ta lion na sgol ina ndeintar an teagasg go leir tre Ghaedhilg ag sior-dhul i meid, agus do reir mar a bhionn na teacs-leabhra ag dul in iomadamhlacht agus na sgoileanna fein ag dul i dtaithighe na hoibre ta barr feabhasa ag teacht ar thoradh a saothair.  'Se an ni is mo ata ag cur cul ar an obair i moran aiteanna na ganntanas muinteoiri.  Ma ta ag meadu i ndiaidh a cheile ar uimhir na muinteoiri ata lan-oilte ar teagasg do thabhairt tre Ghaedhilg, is mire go mor ata ag meadu ar an gcall ata leo.  Cailini ata abalta ar Mhata-maitice no eoluidheacht do mhuineadh tre Ghaedhilg, is iad is mo ata i n-easnamh. 
     Ceard Oideachas: Maidir le Ceard-Oideachas agus le Dan-Oideachas i gcoitchinne tathar ag suil go gcuirfidh an tAcht Oideachais Gairme Beatha, 1930, tus ar re ur. 
     Thainig na chead sceimeanna faoi'n Acht Oideachais Gairme Beatha i bhfeidhm ar an chead la de Mheadhon Foghmhair, 1931.  Ta se ro-luath fos a radh cionnas a d'eirigh leis.  Ach do reir na dtuairisci ta roinnt mhaith deagh-oibre da deanamh ina lan aiteanna.  Ach ni feidir toradh iomlan sceim nuadh Oideachais do mheas go ceann roinnt bliadhan. 
     Faoi na sceimeanna nuadha ta breis airgid le faghail ag na Coisti on Stat no o na Coisti Aitiula ina bhfuilid ag obair.  Meastar go gcaithfidh na Coisti beagnach £300,000 i rith na bliadhna airgeadais seo ar Dhan-Oideachas. 
     Bionn meadu an Deontais on Stat ag brath ar an meadu airgid a gheibh-tear on gCoiste Aitiuil, se sin, an Deontas is feidir leis an gCoiste   Aitiuil d'fhaghail taobh istigh de na teoranta ata leagtha sios.  Fuair 23 coisti as 38 coisti an meadu airgid sin o n-a gCoisti Aitiula fein. 
     Ta na Coisti ag caitheamh an bhreis airgid ata aca ar dha phriomh-chuspoir mar leanas:&mdash; 
     (a)  chun tuilleadh muinteoiri lan-aimsire agus pairtaimsire do sholathar, agus 
     (b)  chun slighe nios fearr agus nios fairsinge do sholathar do na scolairi. 
     Maidir le foirne muinteoireachta, d'oileadh 76 oidi sa bhreis mar oidi lan-aimsire chun teacht suas le leath-anu na Sceimeanna agus leis an bpraidhinn ata le oidi nuadha do sholathar, mar ta:&mdash; 
     20 Oide in Obair Adhmaid agus in Obair Togail Tighthe. 
     16 Oide in Obair Miotail agus in Innealtoireacht Gluaistean. 
     21 Oide i gcoir Banachais Tighe (Domestic Economy). 
     19 Oide i dTuath-eoluiocht. 
     Bhi deireadh le treimhse oiliuna na n-oidi sin i Mi na Nodlag seo caithte, agus is beag nach bhfuil gach duine diobh fostaithe faoi na Coisti. 
     Ta se beartuithe cursa eile in Obair Laimhe (Manual Training) do chur ar bun do oidi chun teagasc do thabhairt sa Ghaeltacht mar a bhfuil an-eileamh ar theagasc de'n chineal san.  Tosno-char ar an gCursa i Meadhon Fogh-mhair 1932 agus Gaedhilgeoiri amhain a leigfear chun an chursa.  Chuige sin, ta £1,000 curtha in airithe ins na Meastachain. 
     Do solathruigheadh breis oiliuna i rith na bliadhna do 70 muinteoiri Ghaedilge d'fhonn an meid teagaisc d'fheadfaidis a thabhairt fe na Sceimeanna Gairme Beatha do leathanu. 
     Maidir le hAruis Scoile ta tosnuigthe dairiribh ag na Coisti nuadha ar an mbreis slighe go bhfuil dian-ghadh lei ina lan aiteanna ar fud na tire do sholathar.  Ta cuid mhor (43) sceimeanna chun scoileanna do thogaint, fe bhraghaid na Roinne i lathair na huaire.  Ta lan-fheidhm da bhaint as Alt 50 agus as Alt 51 den Acht Oideachais Gairme Beatha a thugann comhacht d'Ughdarais Aitiula (Local   Authorities) mar aon leis na Coisti, chun airgead d'fhaghail ar iasacht d'fhonn tighthe scoile do thogaint. 
     Nil aon laghdu ar an tinnreamh ar na Ranganna faoi na Sceimeanna Gairme Beatha.  Ta beagnach 50,000 ag deanamh freastail ar na ranganna san fa lathair.  Is mor an bhreis e sin ar an meid a bhiodh ag freastal ortha sna chead bhliadhanta. 
     Tathar ag suil go ndeanfaidh an bhreis muinteoiri a bhi ag obair o Mheadhon Fhoghmhair seo chuaidh thart, go ndeanfaidh sin lion an tinnrimh do mheadu le haghaidh na bliadhna seo agus le haghaidh na mbliadhanta ata le theacht. 
     Scruduchain sna Ceard-Scoileanna. 
     Nil se d'fhiachaibh ar aoinne dul faoi na scruduchain sin.  Is maith an comhartha e nach bhfuil aon laghdu ar uimhir na n-iarrathoiri. 
     Sceimeanna Oideachais Gairme Beatha. 
     Ta eifeachtalacht an teagaisc atathar a thabhairt faoi Sceim an Dan-Oideachais go maith agus ta se ag dul i bhfeabhas in aghaidh an lae.  I gcomortas leis an sort teagaisc a tug-tai deich mbliana o shoin ceapfai go raibh an teagasc sin go ri-mhaith ach, leis an dul-chun-cinn ata deanta le hoidi d'oiliuint agus le gnothai aiti-ula do riaradh, ta feabhas tagtha ar an sgeal o gach taobh; agus le linn bheith ag meas na hoibre is e rud a bitear ag suil leis an bhfeabhas sin agus bionn an gnath-chaighdean arduithe. 
     Le miniu a thabhairt ar an gciall ata le heifeachtulacht mhaith ni mor breathnu ar na saghasanna sonnracha Ceard-Oideachais agus Dan-Oideachais a bhios ar siubhal faoi churam Coisti Dan-Oideachais.  Is feidir, go generalta, na habhair a teagasctar do roinnt mar leanas:&mdash; 
     1.  Abhair Innealtoireachta &mdash; ar a n-aidmhitear Innealtoireachta Aibhleise, Innealtoireachta Gluaistean, Cleachtadh in Oibriu Miotail, Gleas-radh Talmhaiochta a Dheisiu, Matamaitic Cleachtach agus Liniocht Inneall. 
     
        2.  Abhair a bhaineas le Ceard Foirgnimh ar a n-airmhitear Cear-pantoireacht agus Siuineireacht, Deantus Ceabineid, Obair Adhmaid, Saor-Liniocht agus Liniocht Inneall, agus Matamaitic Cleachtach. 
     3.  Abhair Tighis&mdash;ar a n-airmhitear Cocaireacht, Obair Shnathaide, Nigheachan, Maintimeireacht, Bana-chas Tighe, Slainte-eolas agus Cead-Chabhair (Leighis). 
     4.  Abhair Trachtala agus Liteardha &mdash;ar a n-airmhitear Cuntasaiocht, Tireolas Gheilleagair, Bun-Chunta-saiocht, Gearr-scriobhnoireacht, Clo-scriobhnoireachta, Modhanna Trachtala, Uimhriocht Trachtala, Gaedhilg, Bearla agus Tireolas. 
     5.  Abhair Ealadhan&mdash;ar a n-airmhitear Tuath-eolas, Garradoireacht, Eolas na Camharsanachta, Cuntasaiocht Feilme, Matamaitic Cleachtach agus Ealadha Chleachtach. 
     De ghnath bionn muinteoiri sonn-racha i mbun gach roinn de na habhair sin agus is feidir beagnach na muinteoiri go leir ata ag obair faoi Choisti an Dan-Oideachais a roinnt do reir na gcuig roinn sin. 
     On gcaoi a bhfuil an sgeal go dti seo ta faighte amach nach leor, le go n-eireochadh le ranganna trathnona ina mbionn cuid mhor daoine oga a bhionn ag obair ar feadh an lae nach mor, go mbeadh an muinteoir cailithe i dteoir na n-abhair a bhionn air a mhuineadh, ach go gcaithfidh se eolas a bheith aige freisin ar a ngabhann de chleachtadh leis an teoir sin.  Ni mor don mhuinteoir i gcear-danna Foirgnimh bheith ina shiuineir maith agus ni mor don Mhuinteoir i gcursai Tighis eolas a bheith aici freisin ar Chocaireacht agus ar Obair Shnathaide agus don Mhuinteoir Trachtala taithighe a bheith aige fein i gcursai gnotha ma bhionn se ag suil go mbeadh meas ag na mic leighinn air no go gcuirfeadh siad suim ina theagasc. 
     Do b'fheidir i gcas Roinn 1, 2 agus 3, muinteoiri d'fhail go raibh oilteacht agus cleachtadh aca sna   habhair seo mar is o chursai speisialta a bhi ag an Roinn a fuarthas na Muinteoiri sin agus is de bharr na taithighe a bhi faighte maidir leis na muinteoiri a theghadh agus a oiliuint, a tharla an bhreis eifeach-tulacht teagaise a luadhadh thuas. Cuireann na muinteoiri seo an obair chleachtach ar fhiorthus an chlair. Tugann siad teagasg cinnte do na mic leighinn in obair aithrid a bhaineas go dluth leis an gceird ata acu no leis an gceird go mbeidh futha gabhail lei, agus ina theannta sin tugann siad teagasc doibh sa teoir a ghabhann leis an obair sin.  San am cheadna (no tamall ina dhiaidh sin do reir an saghas mac leighinn a bhios sa rang) tugann siad teagasc in abhair ata gaolmhar da n-abhair fein, mar shampla, Liniocht, Matamaitic, Innealeolas, Tarraiceoireacht Patrun, Slainteolas agus mar sin de. Le goirid anuas do rinneadh amhlaidh, se sin an teagasc sa teoir do choinneal siar go dti go musclui-tear suim an mhic leighinn ann agus go mbeidh muinighin aige as an muinteoir. D'eirigh go ri-mhaith leis an modh sin i gcas mac leighinn a dhearmad an rud a d'fhoghluim siad sa mbun-scoil, no a bhi lag sa mbun-scoil, agus a d'fhag i gan moran luighe aca leis na tri bun-abhair&mdash; Scriobhnoireacht, Uimhriocht agus Leightheoireacht. 
     Daoine go bhfuil Ceimeanna Iol-scoile aca i dTrachtail agus nach bhfuil moran cleachtaidh aca ar chursai ghnothai is mo ata ag muineadh na n-abhar i Roinn 4.  Go ceann cupla bliain ni bhionn siad gar do bheith cho cothrom mar mhuin-teoiri leis na muinteoiri a bhios ag teagasc na n-abhar i Roinn 1, 2 agus 3.  Ni hionann bheith i mbun-rang trathnona i gceard-scoil agus bheith in Iolsgoil agus o tharla nach mbionn aon ullamhu speisialta, den tsaghas a tugtar do na muinteoiri eile, ag na muinteoiri a thagann on Iolscoil i ndiaidh a gceim do ghnothu, bionn se deacair doibh luighe leis an obair. 
     Bionn neart eolais aca ar na habhair a bhionn le teagasc aca ach is mor an deifriocht dearcaidh ata idir iad fein agus na mic leighinn, agus da da bhri sin   is deacair dhoibh suim na mac leighinn do mhuscailt tre cheangal a dheanamh idir an teoir agus an obair a bhionn le deanamh aca 'chuile la.  Ni thig leo moran dul 'n cinn a dheanamh go dti go dtuigidh siad intinn na ndaoine seo go mbionn ortha a mbeatha a shaothru go hog.  I gcionn cupla bliain tuigeann an chuid is mo de na muinteoiri seo an sgeal, agus deantar muinteoiri maithe dhiobh.  Is leir, amh, on meid aimsire a thogann se ortha na mic leighinn a thuisgint, go bhfuil ga le cursa speisialta gairid leis na Ceimnigh seo i dTrachtail, go bhfuil futha dul le muinteoireacht i gCeard-Scoltachai, d'oiliuint. 
     Nil moran de na muinteoiri i &ldquo;Roinn 5&rdquo; i gcomparaid leis na muinteoiri eile.  Ta na muinteoiri seo i nda Roinn&mdash;(a) na daoine seo go bhfuil ceimeanna aca in Ealadhain Fiscigh agus in Innealtoireacht agus ata ag obair i gCeard-Scoileanna na gContae mBuirg agus (b) iad seo go bhfuil Ceimeanna aca i dTuath-eolas no i dTalmhaiocht.  Is fada anois o bunuigheadh an chead aicme agus de ghnath bionn an obair go maith.  Nior thosuigh an dara haicme ag muineadh ach scathamh gearr o shoin.  Do toghadh iad ar bhealach a bhi cosuil go leor leis an mbealach ar toghadh muinteoiri i Roinn 1 agus 2, agus tugadh cursa gairid speisialta dhoibh sa Samhradh anuiridh (1931) le hiad d'ullamhu i gcoir Oideachais Leanunaigh agus Dan-Oideachais faoi'n dtuaith.  Obair de short nuadh i seo agus o tharla nach bhfuil na muinteoiri ag obair ach le cupla mi, ni feidir aon tuairim chinnte a thabhairt faoi fos.  Ta cosulacht san am cheadna go mbeidh toradh maith ar an obair agus ta suil go mbeidh tuille de na muinteoiri sin ag teastail gan moran achair. 
     Fuarthas reidhteach sasuil ar an deacracht a bhi ann chun teagasc eifeachtuil do sholathar in abharaibh speisialta a bhaineas le cearda; agus se reidhteach e sin na muinteoiri lan-oilte ina gceard speisialta fein d'fhostu go pairt-aimsireach chun an teagaise do thabhairt.  Ta an furmhor diobh ag obair i gConntae-Bhuirg Bhaile Atha Cliath; ach ta muin-teoiri   da leitheid ag obair in aitean-naibh eile ina bhfuil eileamh ar theagasc den chineal sin agus ina bhfuil muinteoiri oireamhnacha le faghail sa cheanntar.  Fuarathas amach gur do reir eolais agus clisteachta na muinteoiri fein ina gceard fein a theigheann a gcuid teagaisc chun leasa do sna foghlumoiri.  Ma bhionn an t-eolas ag na muinteoiri agus an chlisteacht da reir ionnta, is iondual go mbionn an teagasc go heifeachtuil, ni fada a bhionn muinteoir i bhfeighil na hoibre go mbionn tuigsint aige ar a chuid scolairi, agus annsan luigheann se le n-a ghno ar nos deagh-mhuin-teora; b'fheidir go muineann se go neamh-ghnathach uaireanta ach muineann se ar a nos fein agus muineann se go maith. 
     Is beag an uimhir de mhuinteoiri Ealadhan agus Ceard ata againn, i gcomparaid leis an meid muinteoiri ata againn in habharaibh eile.  Agus is ins na bailte mora is mo a bhionn siad le faghail.  Is mor i gceart agus is eagsamhail an difriocht dearcaidh agus aigne a bhios ag na foghlumoiri a thagann chun na ranganna so.  Bionn cuid acu ag lorg eolais ar Liniocht, ar Dhealbhoireacht, agus mar sin de,&mdash; cearda a mheasaid a thiocfaidh isteach aiseach chuca fein ina ngnath-obair, no a chabhrochaidh leo chun iad fein d'oileadh i gcoir puist airithe.  Bionn cuid eile ag teacht chun na ranganna mar chaitheamh-aimsire doibh fein no chun breis oilteachta culturdha no saoidheachta do chur ortha fein.  Is iad so, is deireannaighe a luadhaim, is mo a thagann chun na ranganna agus de bhrigh gurb amhlaidh ata agus fos go mbionn il-iomad gnotha ar siubhal acu, is deacra aidhm agus crioch na muinteoireachta ina hiom-laine do stiuradh ar shli go mbeithfi deimhin go bhfuil priomh-chuspoir da leanamhaint go sasamhail.  De ghnath, bionn an mhuinteoireacht a deintear in il-chraobhachaibh na hoibre, go sasamhail, agus i gceanntaraibh airithe bionn si go hard-eifeachtuil; cuir i gcas, i Luimnigh, mar ar ghaibh buadh fe leith leis an Liniocht ar Clardubh a deineadh le linn an Chursa do Mhuinteoiribh a bhi ar siubhal ann le deireannaighe.  Taisbeanann na samp-lai de Ghreas-Obair Ceirde, a cuireadh   isteach ar chomortas na bliadhna anuiridh go ndeintear oilteacht ceirde do mhuineadh go feilimeanta ina lan aiteanna.  In san am cheadna, ni sasamhail an rud e nach bhfuil aidhm no cuspoir fe leith os comhair na lucht foghluma, ins na rangannaibh seo, na nach ndeineann muinteoireacht Eala-dhan anamulacht na feabhas do chur ar an obair ins na gnath-abharaibh eile.  Ta a lan tuarasgabhail speisialta ag cur sios ar ghnath-mhuinteoireacht ceirde sa tir. 
     Ni leor fos an meid eolais ata faighte again ar Scoltachai agus ar Chursai Speisialta Lae, i gcomhair Dan-Oideachais, chun breithiuntas iomlan criochnuithe a thabhairt ortha. Ach maidir le haon chuid de na Scoltacha so in aon ait in ar cuireadh ar bun iad, agus clar (curriculum) speisialta leagtha amach doibh&mdash;clar a ceapadh i gcomhair riachtanaisi aon dreama fa leith de mhacaibh leighinn&mdash;ni miste a radh gur eirigh go rimhaith leo.  Ta buachailli agus cailini ag freastal ortha na raibh ar scoil le bliadhanta, agus glacaid go fonnmhar leis an teagasc, agus imthighid i ndeireadh na bliadhna agus ullmhuchan cinnte deanta aca chun dul le gno airithe eigin.  Is sompla maith na Scoltachai Lae sna haiteacha seo leanas, eadhon, 
     Luimneach&mdash;Innealtoireacht Gluaistean agus Gleasraidh Aibhleise; 
     Bri Chualann&mdash;Teagasc Abhar Tighis; 
     Tiobraid Arann&mdash;Trachtail; 
     An tInbhear Mor&mdash;Loingseoracht agus Trachtail; 
     Ceatharlach&mdash;Teicneolas agus Trachtail; 
     Ceapach na bhFaoiteach&mdash;Abhair Tuaith-eolais (do Bhuachailli agus do Chailini); 
     Cam Eolaing&mdash;Abhair Tuaith-eolais (do Bhuachailli agus do Chailini); 
     Is sompla maith iad ar an ghlaodh-ach ilghneitheach ata ar chinealacha speisialta scoltach i ngach cearn den tir agus is samplai maithe iad freisin, ar fhunduireachtai leighinn ina bhfuil an tinnreamh riaghalta, na mic leighinn duthrach-tach,   agus an teagasg ard-eifeachtach i gcoitchinne. 
     Nil moran cleachtaidh faighte againn fos fa Scoileanna agus fa Chursai Leanamhna i gcoitchinne. Tosnuigheadh san bhFoghmhar seo chuaidh thart ar chupla cursa pairt-aimsire&mdash;eadhon, cursai ina raibh o 6 go 10 n-uaire a chluig de theagasc gach seachtmhain ionnta in abhair mar Gaedhilg, Bearla, Tlacht-eolas, Uimhriocht ach nior eirigh go ro-mhaith leo i gcoitchinne.  Muinteoiri lan-aimsire i nGaedhilg no in abhair Trachtala faoi Choiste an Dan Oideachais a thug an teagasc sin no maighistir scoile na haite agus e ar fastodh pairt-ama.  I ngach cas rinneadh an obair ro-fhoirmealta agus ni rabh moran bainte ag an obair le gleas beatha na ndaoine na le gne agus airdheana na haite; agus thainig de sin gur chaill na mic leighinn suim sna gnaithe agus stad siad de freastal na rang. 
     Ta mor-chuid muinteoiri Gaedhilge ag obair fa Choisti, taoibh amuich de sna muinteoiri ar abharaibh teicniciula.  Ta an chuid is mo acu so ag muineadh ranganna Gaedhilge i mbailte fa'n dtuaith, ach ta breis ag teacht ar an uimhir d'aiteanna ina muintear ranganna Gaedhilge mar chuid den ghnath-chlar oibre ins na Scoltachai Leanamhna leithleacha.  De ghnath, bitear sasta le feabhas na muinteoireachta, ach tagann meath ar an obair de bharr na deacrachta a bhaineann le dul-chun-cinn a dheanamh leis na mic leighinn o bhliadhain go bliadhain.  Is feidir dul-chun-cinn cinnte seasamhach do dheanamh in abharaibh teicniciula, agus go mor mor in obair Laimhe, le tri fichid uair a chluig de mhuinteoireacht; ach i gcas teangan do mhuineadh, is gadh i bhfad nios mo aimsire chun buan-toradh d'fhaghail as an obair.  Ar an abhar sin, muna leanann an mac leighinn ar feadh thri mbliadhan ar a laighead, ar freastal ar na ranganna Gaedhilge agus ag dul ceim ar aoirde in aghaidh na bliadhna, ni feidir do aon dul-chun-cinn do dheanamh dairiribh.  Ta ceanntair airithe ann, cuir i gcas Conntae Chorcaighe, ina bhfuil sceim muinteoireachta na Gaedhilge ar   comhoibriu go hiongantach, agus mealltar na foghlumoiri thar n-ais, bliadhain i ndiaidh bliadhna go hard-ranganna, agus tagann toradh foghanta ar an muinteoireacht da bharr sin, agus faightear gearra-chuid mhaith de sna foghlumoiri agus eolas liomhtha beacht ar an nGaedhilge acu. Faightear toradh maith, freisin, mar a mbionn sceim foghanta scolaireachta ar bun, le n-a gcuirtear na foghlumoiri is toghtha go Colaiste Gaedhilge ar feadh miosa.  Ar an gcuma so tuigtear fath a bheith le hobair an ranga i rith na bliadhna, agus bionn aidhm os comhair an fhoghlumora&mdash;no cuspoir a ghriosuigheann e chun tinnrimh go feileamhail. 
     Ta i gcoitchinne, dha ni do bheir eifeacht don teagasc a tugtar fe sceimeanna Dan-Oideachais.  Se an chead ni dhiobh, suim dhuthrachtach an mhic leighinn fein a dheineann tinnreamh ar na ranganna de ghnath d'fhonn eolas agus cleachtadh d'fhaghail ar abhar eigin ar leith.  Eireochaidh an mac leighinn as an tinnreamh muna sasuightear an mian san aige; agus, da bhrigh sin, beidh ar an oide an t-abhar teagaisc agus an oiliuint a thabhairt do go heifeachtuil ma's ail leis a rang a choinneal o scaipeadh agus o dhul ar neamhni.  Ach mar sin fein, ni bheadh ar an obair a deanfai leis an chuspoir sin amhain ach toradh leamh gan moran tabhaicht.  Se an dara ni agus an priomh-abhar ata le heifeachtulacht na hoibre na dilseacht agus dioghrais na muinteoiri.  Ta speis ag a bhfurmhor ina gcuid oibre, is mor aca a gcuid mac leighinn agus is fonn leo cabhru leo.  On gcaidreamh ata aca cheana le fostathoiri agus le hoibridhthe agus on mbaint ata aca le rangannaibh oidhche i gcomhair daoine ata dairiribh ag obair cheana fein, ta claonadh aca chun a gcuid teagaisc a chur in oiriuint do na riachtanaisi ata fe lathair agus a bheas ar ball ar a gcuid mac leighinn; agus da bhri sin, do bheir siad teagasc tuigseach uatha go mbionn dochas agus muinghin aca as a thairbhe.  Ta an mhuinghin sin, a bheag no a mhor, ag na hoidi Ceard-Oideachais uile beagnach agus is e an priomh-chomhacht e maidir le heif-eacht a gcuid oibre i rangannaibh lae agus oidhehe. 
     
        Ealadha agus Eolaiocht. 
     O tugadh isteach na Meastachain anuraidh nior thainig aon atharu ro-mhor ar a mbaineann le Funduireacht na hEaladhan agus na hEolaiochta agus ni dheanann na Meastachain seo ach solathar, go generalta, do na rudai a bhios ag teastail de ghnath o na Funduireachtai seo. 
     Tathar ag gabhail fos don ath-choiriu atathar a dheanamh do reir na molta a rinne an Coiste Fiosruchain sa mbliain 1927 agus ta cuid mhaith den ath-choiriu i Roinn Sean-Sheod Eireann deanta cheana.  Toisc a laighead spas ata ann ta cosc a chur le hobair Roinn na Beath-eolaiochta ach ta an sceal a phleidhe ag Oifigigh mo Roinn-se le Coimisineiri na nOibreacha Puibli i n-ionnas go mbrostochar leis na pleananna i gcoir na foiriginti ina bhfuil Bailiuchan na Beath-eolaiochta do leathnu. 
     Is mor an chabhair san obair ata a dheanamh i Roinn na Sean-Sheod agus i Roinn na Beath-eolaiochta an bheirt chongantoiri a ceapadh do Chimeadai na Sean-Sheod agus an bheirt eile do ceapadh do Chimeadai Roinn na hEaladhan agus an Tionnscail. 
     Tathar ag deanamh iarracht faoi lathair le Congantoir d'fhail ag a mbeidh cailiochtai i dTlachteolaiocht do Roinn na Beath-eolaiochta.  Nuair a ceapfar an tOifigeach sin beidh lion na foirne ata udaruithe don Roinn sin iomlan. 
     Ni lugha lion na mac leighinn ata ag freastal ar Priomh-Scoil na hEaladhan i mbliana na bhiodh ag freastal uirthe na blianta roimhe seo, agus ta gach saghas obair a deantar sa Scoil ag dul ar aghaidh mar is gnath. 
     Do rinneadh cuid mhor atharuithe le goirid sa gcoir ata ar fail do leigh-theoiri sa Leabharlainn Naisiunta. Ta meadu beag le tabhairt faoi deara ar lion na leightheoiri a bhaineann feidhm as an Leabharlainn o rinneadh na hatharuithe. 
     Maidir le Sceimeanna na Roinne i dtaobh leabhra Gaedhilge d'fhoillsiu ta ag eirghe go maith le foillsiu leabhar i nGaedhilg faoi'n da Sceim go bhfuiltear ag iarraidh solathar 'na   gcoir ( Mean-Oideachais, Fo-Mhir E,  agus  Ealadha agus Eolaiocht,  Fo-Mhir B 1.). 
     Nior bh'fheidir go dti seo toisc a laighead leabhar feiliunach a bhi ar fail, barraiocht teagaisc a thabhairt trid an nGaedhilg, ach is athas liom a radh go bhfuil feabhas ag teacht ar an sceal do reir a cheile.  On bhliain 1927 do foillsigheadh 9 gcinn de theacs-leabhra. Ta leabhra ortha sin ag baint le Ceimseata, Aireamh, Algebar, Stair, Tireolaiocht, Obair Shnathaide agus Laidin.  Ina dteannta sin do foillsigheadh 32 leabhar a bheadh feiliunach mar abhar leightheoireachta in sna Mean - Scoileanna.  Do foillsigheadh an 41 leabhar seo faoi'n Sceim go bhfuiltear ag iarraidh solathar a dheanamh ina coir sa Meastachan i gcoir Ealadha agus Faoi'n sceim go bhfuiltear ag iarraidh solathar a dheanamh ina coir sa Meastachan i gcoir Ealadha agus Eolaiocht do foillsigheadh 58 leabhra ar fad o 1928 no 99 leabhra faoi'n da sceim.  Ta os cionn 200 leabhar a n-ullamhu ag Oifigigh mo Roinne faoi lathair faoi'n da Sceim agus meastar go bhfoillseochar thimcheall's 50 diobh sin taobh istigh den bhliain seo chugainn.  Beidh ar na leabhra sin teacs-leabhra ag baint le Tireolaiocht, Stair, Greigis agus Laidin.  Ta aistriuchain on Fhrainncis, on Ghearmainis, on Spainnis, on Eadailis, on Ruisis, gan tracht ar aistriuchain on Bhearla, ar na leabhra ata a n-ullamhu mar abhar leightheoireachta i gcoitchinn. 
     I dteannta na hoibre seo ta  dha chineal eile  leabhar a gcur le cheile. Ar an  gcead iarracht  ta focloiri de sna tearmai ceardula ata ag teastail sa nGaedhilg a bhfoillsiu.  Ta foillsithe cheana dha leabhran 'na bhfuil Gaedhilg ar na tearmai ceardula a bhaineas le (a) muineadh Staire agus Tireolaiochta agus (b) le muineadh Gramadaighe agus Litriochta.  Ta suil go mbeidh leabhran eile den chineal cheadna&mdash;in a mbeidh na tearmai a bhaineas le hEolaiocht, le Ceol agus le Trachtail&mdash;reidh an bhliain seo chugainn. 
     
        Agus ar an  dara h-iarracht  ta Focloir Bearla-Gaedhilge a ullamhu. Ta an obair seo ag dul ar aghaidh go maith.  Do tosnuigheadh uirthe i ndeireadh na bliana 1930, agus ta suil go mbeidh an Focloir seo ar an margadh roimh dheire na bliana 1933. Ba cheart go mbeadh se ina Fhocloir bhunusach go ceann moran blian. 
     I dteannta na bhfoillsiuchan seo cuidigheann an Roinn le leiriu Dramai i nGaedhilg tre Dheontaisi a thabhairt do Choluchaisi aithride a leirigheann dramai Gaedhilge.  Is i bhfuirm Deontas-i-gCabhair (£1,200) ata roinnte idir Chomhar Dhramaiochta Bhaile Atha Cliath agus Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe a tugtar an chabhair.  Ar feadh na 15 miosa o Eanar 1931 go Marta 1932 do bhi naoi leirithe ag Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe agus i gcas Comhar Bhaile Atha Cliath leirightear dramai i rith an Gheimhridh agus le roinnt bliain anuas bhi seacht leiriu in aghaidh an tsiosoin aca. 
     
      
       The practice has been to take the debate on Education generally on the Vote for the Office of the Minister, and to conclude that debate the Minister replies to questions or criticisms.  Subsequent Votes for the Department are put without debate.  That procedure would not preclude Deputies from asking questions on these Votes.  This means that the debates on Votes 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 and 51 would take place now.  I presume that the existing practice will be followed. 
     
     
      
       I do not want to occupy the time of the House very long.  A considerable amount of money is involved in these Estimates, as has been pointed out, from year to year. For very many obvious reasons, I do not intend to take up the time of the House at any length now.  As the House is aware, the Estimates were prepared under the Minister's predecessor. To some extent, consequently, there may be some slight difficulty in discussing the Estimates, especially as I gather there was really no fundamental change, and I think the country will congratulate the Minister on this. 
     
     
        In the interesting precis that the Minister gave in the general report of the affairs of his Department and as to how they now stand, a certain number of people will undoubtedly get information as to the progress that has been made in the Department in the last twelve months; and also possibly a certain number of people will gain a certain amount of comfort from the belief that the foundations of our educational system have been well laid, that the whole institutions that the Minister has taken over are in a flourishing condition, and that while modifications in detail may be necessary, up to the present, at all events, I gather that the Minister has not announced any fundamental change in policy.  Naturally with that I have no fault to find. 
     Everybody will admit that in this matter, particularly, every year must mean on the part of everybody engaged in education&mdash;on the part of the teachers on whom must fall the re-sponsibility, as well as on the Department, there must be a determined effort to go forward.  The functions of the Department are to a large extent guiding functions.  On the Department and on the teachers must fall the duty of making every effort to advance. Naturally the advance cannot be as rapid as some people would wish.  I think everybody who is acquainted with the difficulties, some of which the Minister referred to, will readily acknowledge that unless there is a determined effort to go forward there will be a danger of falling back.  There were a certain number of matters raised in the Minister's report on which I would like a little more detailed information.  The Minister will remember that on previous occasions here, and, generally speaking, throughout the country there was a certain amount of criticism of the fact that, for instance, in the secondary schools, our programme was too limited. Efforts were made to meet what seemed to be legitimate in that particular complaint, recognising, of course, the particular problems that this country had to face, and recognising that the school curriculum&mdash;that is, the number of subjects that an individual   pupil might be expected to take&mdash;has definite limits. 
     I gather that the Minister looked forward to some improvement, especially so far as modern continental languages are concerned, in the coming year, but I should like to know how far the schools are actually availing themselves of the opportunity of greater freedom that was given to them by the modifications that were recently introduced.  It is really that I am asking information from the Minister; I am not criticising him or his Department in this particular matter because it is a matter primarily for the schools, but I think it would be interesting to know whether the schools have shown any readiness, or as much readiness as might be expected, to avail of the freedom that they continually demanded, but which occasionally when it was granted they showed themselves rather slow to accept.  How far has there been in that respect, therefore, a widening of the curriculum?  On what grounds exactly is the Minister's hope founded, and on which he looks forward to an improvement in that particular respect, especially so far as the language is concerned in the years 1933 and 1934?  It is owing, possibly, to the way in which examinations loom into the education curricula of this country, especially in the secondary schools for many years&mdash;almost for a generation and a half&mdash;that it is difficult to get the schools to shake themselves free altogether from the dominance of the examination.  I fully realise the difficulty of that, but if it could be done, I think, on the whole something would be achieved.  I, therefore, would like to know whether the Minister is in a position to give any information along the lines I suggest.  We are rather late in the year discussing this Estimate, and I did not gather from the Minister whether there would or would not be Supplementary Estimates. 
     The reason I ask this is the following:&mdash;The Minister may remember, and possibly all Parties in the House will remember, that since he came into the House, and before he came into the House, the predecessors of the Minister had to withstand a barrage every year for increased expenditure&mdash;enormous   demands, possibly demands that would increase the educational budget, as was more than pointed out, by anything from a million to a million and a half.  On this occasion speeches were made from the Government Benches that, unfortunately, owing to financial stringency those demands could not be met.  Now I submit to the Minister that, as money seems to be extraordinarily plentiful&mdash;as far as the Government is concerned they seem to have an inexhaustible supply of money &mdash;here is an opportunity for those Deputies who, in former years, made those demands, now making those demands effective in the particular line. If money is being spent broadcast&mdash; and undoubtedly it is as far as the public can judge, being spent rather lavishly at the present moment&mdash;I would like to know whether any effort is being made to secure a portion of that golden shower for those reforms that we were told on so many previous occasions were absolutely necessary. 
     Perhaps in that respect the Minister might also give some information as to&mdash;again a perennial question&mdash;the exact state at the moment of the Teachers' Pension Fund.  What are the intentions of the Government in that respect?  The Minister may remember that certain negotiations were entered into some twelve months ago by the then Executive Council and the then Executive of the teachers.  How far has that agreement been repudiated by both sides?  How far does it still hold? How far have steps been taken to examine or to deal with the questions raised&mdash;and so often raised&mdash;on the Pensions Fund?  I really am looking for information on this particular point.  It is, I think, the Minister will admit, extremely difficult for the public to know precisely what is the exact state of affairs in this and in allied matters, shall I say, at the present moment.  The Minister has indicated that he intends to introduce a modification of the Secondary Teachers' Pension Scheme.  Perhaps, therefore, this might be a suitable opportunity for the Minister to have an actuarial investigation of the present state of the fund made, so that the Government may be   in a position to know precisely what the commitments already are, so far as the public is concerned, and what the commitments of the modification that the Minister foreshadows are likely to be. 
     I think anybody engaged or interested in education, or anybody who listened to the debates here year after year, would know that there are many directions in which money could be usefully spent on education.  I should not suggest, if I were to take the economic view I hold of the country, that I could advocate that very strongly at the present moment, but for the moment I put myself into the point of view of the Government Party&mdash;an extremely difficult feat, I confess, for me to accomplish&mdash;and I think there ought to be an opportunity, as I have already said, for wide reforms, and for large claims by the Minister and his colleagues.  Again and again people have pointed out the desirability of dealing with those between the ages of fourteen and sixteen years.  The Technical Education Bill did not or could not make the attendance age at primary or technical schools compulsory for those not in employment. When that was going through, the Minister will remember that that was a problem that seemed to baffle solution.  Certainly the Minister's predecessor could not solve it, and the House had no real definite practical solution to offer. 
     Now, as I say, that money is so plentiful for spending purposes, the raising, for instance, in large cities of the school age to sixteen, for those who have not reached the sixth standard, involves considerable expenditure, hence I should hesitate myself to urge it, but possibly the Minister, now that there is a warm-hearted, generous Government in power, might be willing to meet any claims put forward in that respect.  There are some other minor matters of detail on which possibly the House would like a little information.  I am glad to hear that the facilities given under the recent Technical Education Act are being availed of, and that increased accommodation is being found for technical schools.  When the Act came into force   there was a refreshing tendency&mdash;I may say, in some respects, a decidedly encouraging tendency, a tendency that gave agreeable surprise to those interested in technical education&mdash;on the part of the Local Authorities, not merely to bear the increased burden that was put on them by that Act, but, as I think the Minister will agree, even to go beyond that, and to come forward with contributions for the building of technical schools.  I should like to know whether that tendency has been continued and how far it has gone.  One particular matter as I am on the question of accommodation&mdash;I have been asked once or twice about it, and the Minister will be particularly  au fait  with the question, that is how, precisely, does the project of handing over the Model Schools in Kilkenny to the Technical Committee there, under certain conditions, stand? How far has that advanced, say, in the last six or seven months?  I admit that is possibly a detailed question and one which the Minister should normally get notice of, but owing to the peculiar circumstances of that particular case, I take it for granted the Minister has full information on the matter.  The Minister referred to the state of education in the various subjects. He had generally words of comfort to give to the House, but I think there was an exception in the condition of mathematics.  I think the Minister, if I interpreted him correctly, did not suggest there had been an improvement there. 
     I recognise fully the difficulty of the problem the Minister was up against. I raise that now because it was a question that I think the House will remember that was particularly raised last year in the very interesting debate that took place on the education estimates on that occasion, and I think his predecessor promised that the Department would institute an investigation into that particular matter.  I do not say now, and I do not think very great hopes were held out as to whether an investigation could exactly produce an immediate solution, but on investigation as to what exactly was the real state of affairs in connection with the teaching of mathematics, especially in the primary schools, the   Minister will remember it was exceedingly difficult from the reports of the different Inspectors&mdash;exceedingly difficult from the views that were held by those who wrote as experts in the Press&mdash;to find out precisely what was the condition of mathematics in the primary schools; and in so far as there might be a foundation for the charge that it was unsatisfactory what precisely was the cause of such unsatisfactoriness in connection with that subject.  I know all the subjects will present a difficulty in securing that we continually keep up-to-date, continually advance,&mdash;as I pointed out was necessary.  It may be particularly difficult in the case of mathematics, not altogether, by any means, owing to any fault on the part of the teachers, especially the older teachers, because mathematicians and mathematical experts, and experts on mathematical training and teaching have been varying their views as to what should be done, and a great deal of the difficulty may be due to the fact that an effort is being made to combine a couple of things that may be difficult to mix together, to induce men that were trained in an older system of mathematics, of rather advanced years to change their system.  I would like to know whether the Minister thinks that that is one of the causes of what he considers the unsatisfactory condition of the teaching of mathematics at the present moment. 
     However, I raised this question merely to know what advance has been made in finding out the information that was more or less promised, not necessarily for this debate, but was promised something over twelve months ago.  How far has the investigation into the cause of what many people then considered a weakness in our primary system&mdash;how far has that gone?  Everybody will share the Minister's strong hopes of the benefits that may accrue to this country from the working of the Technical Education Act.  People will naturally hope, and the public who are interested in education and in the general welfare and progress of the country will hope that every use will be made of that Act. They will share in the Minister's hope that the full three years' course will   be attended, and that there will be progress from year to year.  That is a hope everybody certainly will share.  A policy has been introduced, well, not exactly introduced, but has been flung upon the country to deluge the country, as the Minister is probably aware in the last six months.  Whatever may be its effect, it has at least for its object the setting up of factories in this country.  I am not now going to discuss how far it is likely to achieve that object.  Many people might hold, and I might agree with them, that it is likely to secure the opposite effect, but I take it for granted the Minister would be far from sharing my views on that particular matter.  We must assume that he looks forward to a great industrial development in this country, great factory development especially.  That being so, I would like to know what steps have been taken to accommodate his technical system not to the catastrophe that some people fear may occur but to the great industrial hopes that are shared by the Government of which the Minister is a member.  I take it for granted if the Ministry has these great hopes of industrial development that these are shared by the Minister himself, consequently, I have no doubts his Technical Department has been instructed.  I am speaking in all seriousness now, to see that every effort is made to have the closest cooperation between the industrial development and his technical system.  I would like to know how far this increased industrialism has been prepared for&mdash;not merely in vague generalities prepared for&mdash;but actually in the working out in all concrete detail so far as the technical schools are concerned, and how far that has been brought to the notice of the various technical schools throughout the country. 
     One more word.  The Minister referred to the Museum.  He will remember that year after year a certain amount of complaint was made here about the accommodation in the Museum.  I think it was acknowledged that that complaint was not without foundation, though various plans were   put forward always in public as to how that particular congestion could be remedied, because the congestion meant that one of the most interesting and in some respects one of the most educative institutions under the direct control of the Minister, was not able, owing to the congestion, to fulfil its functions as fully as it might, and owing to the congested state of the Museum a proper exhibition of the objects was extremely difficult, if not impossible.  Efforts, as the public knows, were made of a rather drastic character to deal with one particular side of that&mdash;clearing out of the Museum a lot of reproductions of plaster casts and that did increase accommodation.  Then there were building plans for the extension of the Museum.  I would like to know how far they have advanced.  I would like to bring to the Minister's personal notice, and I am sure he has given it considerable attention, the project that might considerably relieve the pressure of the Museum without putting any undue burden on the taxpayer.  I am speaking now of the Kildare Street end of the Museum, Art and Industries and the Irish archæological exhibits, if I may so call them.  There is no reason why these should be actually kept in the same building.  There is, as the Minister knows at the present moment, at least there was, a Departmental Committee looking into the question of building accommodation.  A large suite of rooms, some I think that might be quite suitable for museum purposes, were being liberated.  I quite admit that some of these may be necessary for public receptions.  His colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, will undoubtedly put in strong claims so far as some of these rooms are concerned. On the first floor&mdash;not the ground floor&mdash;of the Castle there are undoubtedly rooms that could very well be utilised to relieve the pressure in the Museum.  Other Departments will, undoubtedly, make strong claims for accommodation there.  I do not know how far the Minister has given personal thought to the matter, but if, after examination, that scheme were found to be feasible, I think the Minister could put forward a strong claim for increased accommodation for   the Museum in the Castle.  There is no reason why the claims of the Minister for External Affairs should not be met and at the same time considerable accommodation found in the place that I suggest for the Museum. 
     There are various other questions that I might raise.  I need only go back to the speeches of the Minister and of his then colleague, the present Ceann Comhairle, as well as to speeches of various members of his two Parties, the Fianna Fail Party and the Labour Party.  I could raise all these, but I do not think it would be quite fair.

       Go maith. 
     
     
      
       I do not wish to say very much on this subject, but there are one or two matters to which I wish to refer. I should like to say that one suggestion made by the last speaker, that pupils in primary schools should be instructed in Irish dancing will, no doubt, receive a cordial reception throughout the country.  My recollection of my school days is that if I was invited to learn an Irish jig in the course of the morning's work, I would welcome the proposal, and I think my classmates would have done do also. 
       There are two matters on which I should like some information from the Minister when he is replying.  I understand that the policy of the Department of Education now is that in all classes in the primary schools outside the Gaeltacht, as well as within, all subjects should be taught through the medium of Irish, whether the teacher is competent to do so, without any regard whatever to the competence of the pupils to understand the teacher. I fully appreciate that, in this country, primary education may be said to have a dual purpose, first, to educate the children generally, and second, to stimulate the revival of the language, and it becomes a question, on which I would like to hear the Minister, as to whether the best means of stimulating the language is to attempt to teach the children subjects which are essential to them if they are to be able to earn a living in the world, through the medium of a language which the children do not understand.  I venture to suggest to the Minister that if that policy be pursued throughout those parts of this country where the language is not spoken, the net result of it will be that the Irish language, which he and I and many others are most anxious to see revived, will come to stink in the nostrils of the people. 
     
     The strain on small children, when they first go to school, in endeavouring   to pick up the rudiments of subjects that ordinarily they are taught is considerable. If to abnormal strain is added the fact that the children are being addressed continually and exclusively in a language which they do not understand, I consider that great damage will be done to the children's constitutions.  I submit to the Minister that if young children do not get a good start in the sphere of primary education their education will never progress as satisfactorily as it might. In that connection I would ask the Minister to go outside his Party, and to get the opinion of observers through the country, who have no particular outlook, but who merely look upon things as they see them, and to ascertain what are their impressions of the condition of primary education, even during the last three or four years, when the system of teaching through Irish has become much more wide-spread. I think he will find that the vast majority of parents and employers of juveniles will tell him that the standard of education in the three primary subjects, reading, writing and arithmetic, has deteriorated enormously. 
     
      
       Oh, no.  No proof. 
     
     
      
       I am not attacking the Minister.  I am only making the suggestion that he should go outside the usual sources of information available in a Department, and ask the ordinary people up and down the county, the parents of children attending primary schools, and the people who habitually take pupils from these schools straight into their employment, if they did not find that there was a very great deterioration in these three branches of education.  Of course the Minister will understand that when I invite him to go outside his own Department I do so only because I know that the officers of the Department of Education are zealous to carry into effect, to the best of their ability, the policy of the Government.  One would assume their natural predeliction to be that the schools in which every subject is taught through the medium of Irish are as good as any others.  I am asking the Minister to go to people with   another outlook, those who are simply looking to the results, and who have no feeling at all as to the method. 
       I was discussing the matter recently with a primary teacher of wide experience and liberal outlook, a man who shared my anxiety for the promotion and spread of the Irish language.  I asked him why the writing of children coming from the primary schools was so dreadfully bad, compared with what it used to be ten or fifteen years ago.  His answer was that in those days time was allowed for the teaching of writing, but that it was impossible to allow time now, owing to the amount of time required to be devoted exclusively to the teaching of Irish and to satisfy the authorities.  I tell the Minister frankly, that, in my experience, young persons coming from the primary schools are not able to write what would be called a middling good hand, while the standard of ordinary spelling is very low.  The standard of simple addition and simple mathematics is intolerably and preposterously low.  I am speaking from the point of view of the earning capacity of the children, and I can assure the Minister that it is a very grave handicap to young persons going out into life when employers find they cannot tot figures and cannot read a simple piece which they would be prepared to stand over. As to their general knowledge, it is absolutely nil.  I do not know if it is the policy of the Department of Education simply to teach the children geographical knowledge applying to the country in which they were born, and to let them find out the rest where they like.  Certainly that is what is happening.  I draw the Minister's attention to these facts, because I earnestly believe that the spread of the impression which has been made upon me is re-acting most unfavourably on the prospects of a healthy revival of the Irish language. 
     
     I should like to make a suggestion to the Minister as to the course he might pursue under powers which I think he already possesses, and that would not require any additional legislation. The great trouble in the Gaeltacht, as I know intimately to be   the case in Donegal, where the language is still living, is the economic condition of the people.  Heretofore the children of these families, if they wanted to be of any financial assistance to their parents, went away to England, to America or to Scotland. 
     On more than one occasion I have asked if the Minister for Education would not make a bolder use of the powers he has.  I do not see why the Minister, if he really wants to preserve the language, if he really means business, and has a really enthusiastic Executive Council in this matter&mdash;and I do not think the Minister for Education in the last Government had &mdash;would not make it publicly known to every Irish-speaking household in the Gaeltacht that any child at the conclusion of primary education would be afforded an opportunity of being tested free of charge for fitness to be trained as a national teacher.  If you got every year about 20 per cent. of the boys and girls from primary schools in the Gaeltacht whom you could train up for whatever period is necessary, I suggest that the remaining 80 per cent. should be offered at the expense of the Government a technical training in any trade they chose to pursue, that training to be given them in a technical college situated in the Gaeltacht, either in Galway or some place like Donegal.  It would probably be desirable to have two colleges, one for Connacht and one for the rest of the country.  If that course were pursued you would build up, in the course of a few years, a brigade of teachers who really could teach Irish, and not teach the stuff that is being doled out by a number of teachers who went down to Spiddal and other places to take a three weeks' course in order to qualify to keep their jobs. 
     I do not blame the teachers.  They do their best, but any unprejudiced observer knows that a lot of the stuff that is being doled out inside national schools, in Government offices, and in Dail Eireann for that matter, as Irish is anything but Irish.  If you were to ask any native speaker what it was he   would probably say that it might be Persian but it was not Irish. 
     
      
       Give a sample of it yourself. 
     
     
      
       Ni amadan mise.  I know my own limitations and I am well able to realise that, while I can understand and read Irish, until I am in a position to speak it as it should be spoken I am not going to inflict it on the suffering ears of an audience.  If every member of the House took a lesson from me it would be much easier for us to conduct our business here.  Furthermore, I am not going to write it down and then read it out in the House.  Until I am in a position to speak it as it should be spoken I am not going to try. 
     
     As I was saying, after a few years you will have Gaelic teachers who can speak the language in the way it should be spoken.  The Department of Education could then quite legitimately, in my opinion, proceed outside the Gaeltacht and schedule a narrow area along the border of the Gaeltacht, where the language is not dead but dormant and dying, and could pursue an active policy of teaching real Irish to the children in the primary schools in that area.  In those areas along the border of the Gaeltacht, where the old people are native speakers and naturally prefer to speak Irish, middle-aged people mostly understand it but they have got out of the habit of talking it.  The children are being taught what is properly called in the county &ldquo;book Irish&rdquo; or pidgin Irish.  That is the present situation.  The small children go home and try to air their knowledge in the presence of their grandparents and they get laughed at for their trouble.  If you had competent Irish teachers who would speak Irish as it should be spoken, the small children would be taught real Irish and when they went home you would find that the small children and the old people would be talking across the heads of the fathers and mothers of the children in their own language. Then a number of people who find a difficulty in using the language, if it were introduced into the houses by the   children coming home from school, would start speaking it again.  I know that from my own experience.  I have seen it happen again and again in different places that if you engage elderly people in conversation in Irish in districts in close proximity to the true Gaeltacht, before you are talking five or six minutes you will find a number of middle-aged people whom you never dreamt had a knowledge of Irish joining in the conversation. After they have been speaking for a few minutes you will find them getting more fluent when they get into the swing of it.  If the Department want to revive Irish&mdash;and I believe the Department and the Executive Council do want to revive it&mdash;that is the way to do it.  The first step is to secure that any teacher placed in charge of children to teach them Irish will teach them real Irish and not pidgin Irish. The teachers cannot do that if they do not know the language themselves. 
     The all-important thing for the Department to remember in the process of teaching Irish is: do not stir up public opinion against your campaign. If you have not got public goodwill with you in this business it is absolutely hopeless.  No amount of enthusiasm or zeal on the part of the teachers will ever pull the thing off.  If the people are not with you the revival of the Irish language is absolutely beyond the bounds of possibility.  There is one means of crystallising and strengthening public opposition to the revival of the language, and that is the impression throughout rural and urban districts in the country that children are being denied an education adequate to earning their living as a result of the teaching of Irish in the schools. That impression&mdash;and I urge on the Minister to make inquiries into the matter&mdash;is growing and becoming more widespread every day.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that if the present policy is continued of teaching children all through the Galltacht, where there is no Irish, and where there has not been any Irish for the last fifty years, of teaching these children who never heard a word of Irish through the medium of Irish, there will grow up in the eastern counties and the midlands a public   opinion against the revival of the Irish language, which will wipe the Gaeltacht out of existence in the course of the next ten years.  It all depends on the public outlook. 
     I make a special appeal to the Minister in this regard.  He has a great chance.  If he gets it into his head that he can dragoon this country into the learning of the Irish language &mdash;he has it in his power to kill or save the Irish language&mdash;before public opinion is ready for it, he will kill the Irish language absolutely, finally, and irrevocably in the course of the next few years.  If he makes up his mind, however, to turn to the Gaeltacht, to spread the language out of the Gaeltacht and to bring home to every Irish speaker in the Gaeltacht that the Irish language is a valuable asset, that any child born with the Irish language on his lips is going to have an assured future, that is the way to succeed. That is the way in which he will prevent any homestead allowing the language to die out within it.  His colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, recently said that he was not going to compel anybody to grow wheat, but that he is going to say to every farmer who would grow wheat that he will guarantee that piece of wheat as a valuable asset.  He is right in his psychology whatever one may think of his economics on that point. 
     I appeal to the Minister for Education to take a leaf from his book on the psychological aspect of this problem. Let him drive it home that where the Irish language is truly spoken the children have an asset that will secure them a livelihood in their own country. If he does that he will re-vitalise the Gaeltacht.  Out of that he will get at the same time a competent supply of Irish teachers which will make it possible for him conscientiously to know that what he is having taught in the schools is the real Irish language as spoken by our forefathers.  I suggest the Minister should consider these proposals. 
     I should like also to remind the Minister of the urgent necessity of making it clear to the parents of every child that if the child does not prove to be a suitable candidate in the teaching profession, he will not be dropped   like a hot brick but that the Government will give him, if he is found not to be fit to be a teacher, in consideration of his qualifications as an Irish speaker a technical education in any trade which he chooses to pursue.  It is well worth while doing that, and it is not going to cost an enormous amount of money.  It is certainly not going to cost more money than the thing is worth.  To my mind it is the only hope now of saving the language and it will have this further enormous advantage.  There is a great public opinion growing up against compulsory Irish in its present form as taught in the primary schools in areas outside the Gaeltacht.  The very withdrawal of that campaign in the Galltacht would create a favourable opinion for an intensive scheme in the Gaeltacht. The mere fact that the people in the Galltacht had their fears allayed as to the deterioration of the general standard of education in the primary schools outside the Gaeltacht would create a very favourable opinion as regards any expense that might be involved in intensifying, on the lines I suggested, the promotion of the Irish language within the Gaeltacht.  To my mind that is the principal problem at present before the Department of Education. 
     Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has referred to a variety of other important matters, but the big difficulty, the big issue, by which the present Minister's reputation will stand or fall is whether the Irish language perished under his administration or not.  It will be admitted that there were those in the late administration who did magnificent work, against difficult odds very often.  I think it will be agreed that one of the most zealous and sincere workers for the Irish language was the ex-Minister for Finance, Deputy Blythe.  I believe that the work which the late administration did has made it possible for the present Minister for Education to take his opportunity to do a great work.  They kept the language alive and they did many things for which the nation owes them a great debt, and owes them something else in respect of the Irish language.   One was this intensive campaign for compulsory Irish through the Galltacht. If the Minister will consider something along the lines I propose, I believe he can do a great work for the country. 
     A number of other questions might be raised under this Vote into which I do not propose to go.  I will leave them for Deputies who may follow.  I do urge upon the Minister most strenuously, however, to make an inquiry amongst the parents and the employers of young persons coming out of the primary schools in the Galltacht as to their standard of education in reading, writing, arithmetic, and ordinary general knowledge.  If he gets an honest report, from people without any prejudices in the matter, I think he will be astonished at what the seventh standard is now in national schools in those places.  I speak with a full realisation of the gravity of what I am saying.  A large number of children coming out of the seventh standard of primary schools to-day, so far as the English language is concerned, are semi-illiterate.  They are not able to write anything like a literate hand and they are ill-able to spell, but they can read reasonably well.  Furthermore, their knowledge of arithmetic is deplorably inadequate, and their general knowledge, both historical and geographical, is astonishingly deficient.  So far as their knowledge of Irish is concerned, it is also astonishingly deficient.  I would ask the Minister to look into these questions and try to find out, from the classes of persons to whom I have referred, what their opinion is.  If he does get an honest opinion, I think he will find that the conditions are as I have stated. 
     
      
       In the task of reviving and preserving the Irish language which has been undertaken, this country is facing a work which I do not think has been faced anywhere else. There has been something in the nature of language revivals in various countries, but there has never been, so far as I know, any question of restoring and reviving a language that   had sunk to the weak position to which the Irish language has sunk.  It will require every effort that it is possible to make, and it will require all the cooperation that it is possible to receive, in order to carry out that task successfully. A speech like Deputy Dillon's illustrates one of the big difficulties that are before us.  I think undoubtedly the position is that up to the present we have not been doing enough for the language.  In many directions we have not been going far enough in order to check the decay which was going on.  On the other hand, we do depend on the goodwill of people who have not Irish, and on the goodwill of many people whose interest in the Irish language is small&mdash; the goodwill of people who are prepared to vote for the revival of the Irish language, but who are probably prepared to oppose every separate activity undertaken as a result of their vote.  We are liable to have, not merely any sacrifices that may arise, or that may be called for as a result of the language policy, magnified, but to have things ascribed to the language policy which are not really the result of it.  The difficulty, therefore, is that on the one hand we cannot go too far or too fast, for fear of alienating the body of opinion on which we must depend for the work, and on the other hand, we cannot go too slow, or the language will be gone while we are arguing about the speed with which we ought to move to restore or preserve it, or about the methods which we ought to adopt. 
     
     Deputy Dillon has talked about the question of teaching through Irish. That is a question of considerable difficulty, but I do not think the difficulty lies where Deputy Dillon first laid the emphasis.  It is not so much a question of the children not knowing Irish.  As far as I know, the scheme is that children be taught sufficient Irish to understand the instruction, at least fairly well, and that then they should be taught various subjects through Irish&mdash;their Irish improving as they were being taught.  Undoubtedly, if a proper foundation of Irish is laid, any subject can be taught by a competent teacher perfectly well through the   medium of Irish.  We have examples in many schools where the most excellent results have been obtained in various subjects and where all the instruction was given through Irish and given to children who came to school without Irish.  The difficulty is not on the side of the children if proper precautions are taken, and these precautions are not difficult to take.  The difficulty is with the teachers. 
     It is undoubtedly a fact that a great many&mdash;perhaps the majority&mdash;of our teachers are not able to give instruction through Irish.  We have to do the best that can be done with them, but a great many of them are hardly competent even to teach Irish satisfactorily. The teacher&mdash;even the most competent teacher&mdash;is handicapped very much by the lack of books.  Something has been done and more is in progress, as we all know and as the Minister said, in regard to the provision of books; but there is a tremendous shortage of textbooks up to the present.  In many subjects no textbooks are available or, if there are one or two, they are not always of the best and do not always suit the particular class for which they may have to be used.  I believe that teaching through Irish is necessary and that the language cannot possibly be saved or extended without it.  I am not in favour of pushing it forward unduly to the extent of having it done by an incompetent teacher, nor am I in favour of encouraging a teacher, not fully competent, to undertake it. Where the teacher is competent, however, it can be done, and without any disadvantage whatsoever to the children. I think that that has been amply demonstrated in the Preparatory Colleges and in a number of other schools. 
     Deputy Dillon referred to the question of writing.  I do not know whether there would be any hope of the present Government doing something which the late Government never had the courage to do&mdash;although I think it was being gradually screwed up to the sticking point&mdash;and that is, whether they would drop the old script.  I believe it is a tremendous handicap.  The old type is a great handicap to the   language.  It proved a great handicap to the language heretofore.  I believe the script is even a greater handicap. I think one of the difficulties in teaching writing to children is that they have to be taught first in one script and then in another, and their writing is like nothing on earth in either script.  It imposes a burden and a handicap which I think can hardly be borne.  I think the difficulty of actually saving the Irish language is so great, it is so much of a touch-and-go business, that no handicap should unnecessarily be put upon the work.  I believe that at least one complaint upon which Deputy Dillon lays weight &mdash;and I have no doubt a great many employers and parents lay a great deal of weight on it too&mdash;could be got rid of if all the writing were done in the one script.  It is a small point in one way, but I think it would get rid of one source of complaint. 
     I don't think enough is being done to save the Irish language.  On the other hand, I think progress must be gradual.  If new steps are in contemplation, or new steps can be devised, they must be taken one by one so as not to cause undue hardship and so as not to rouse unnecessary opposition to the whole policy.  I hope the Government will pursue their policy and will, as time goes on, devise new methods and extend the use of existing methods and that, without the indiscretion that is to be noticed in their tariff policy, they will show some of the zeal that we have seen in that connection.  I agree with Deputy Dillon in one part of his speech.  The question of the salvation and preservation of Irish depends on the Gaeltacht, or what is commonly called the Fior-Ghaeltacht&mdash;that part of the country where Irish is the common language of the people, in their homes and at fairs and when they meet on the road-side. The language cannot possibly be saved if it dies out in these districts where it now exists.  If it were allowed to die there, whatever might be done in the schools it would gradually become more anaemic and more deserving of the term &ldquo;pidgin-Irish,&rdquo; which Deputy Dillon used.  These districts   must be saved and there must be a concentration on them.  From what I know of these districts and from the psychology of the people in them, I am perfectly certain nothing that could be done in the Gaeltacht, if it were to be confined to the Gaeltacht, would be of any use.  There is no possibility of making the people of the Gaeltacht consent to be a peculiar group in this country.  No matter what inducement may be offered them, they will only stick to Irish if they can be made to feel that the revival of the language is a matter of national policy; that they are not some remnant that is left behind by the nation, and that when the nation is won round linguistically they will be in the van of progress. 
     One of the things necessary is to use as far as possible the brains of the Gaeltacht&mdash;to bring the intelligent and clever young people to the front in their own areas and in the rest of the country.  Besides that being a good policy for the language generally, I think it is the best policy for the Gaeltacht itself.  All sorts of relief schemes and other economic schemes may be adopted for the Gaeltacht and they may be of considerable importance, but I think nothing is better than education for the children.  I do not think you could go so far as to undertake to provide for every child in the Gaeltacht either as a national teacher or in some other way.  I think the steps that have already been taken can be and should be extended as soon as it is possible to put the machinery into operation.  We should endeavour, as far as possible, to draw all the really good young people&mdash;that is, from the intellectual point of view&mdash;of the Gaeltacht into some of the teaching or allied professions.  As has been stated by the Minister, a certain amount is being done.  There are special scholarships of various sorts, and there is free tuition in the colleges; there are grants for outfits, clothing and travelling expenses.  It is now possible for people from the genuine Irish-speaking homes in the Gaeltacht to have some chance of getting an education and entering the teaching profession. 
     More work is, however, necessary in   that respect.  Something should be done in the way of trade or technical scholarships.  Of course you cannot make sure that every home in the Gaeltacht will benefit directly, but the aim should be that many of the homes there will benefit and that the teaching profession particularly will gradually become all that we would wish it in the matter of mastery of the Irish language.  I think that not quite enough people from the Gaeltacht have entered the preparatory colleges.  I do not know whether enough people are entering them yet. I would like to see at least half of those entering the preparatory colleges, people from the Irish-speaking homes in the Fior-Ghaeltacht.  Unless others entered the training colleges directly that would give us only 25 per cent. of the teachers in the country.  I would regard that as the minimum in view of public opinion and in order to prevent this revolt which Deputy Dillon is conscious of in another direction. 
     I do not say that you should draw all the teachers from the Fior-Ghaeltacht, but you could get a very big proportion.  If we could encourage young people from the Irish-speaking districts to enter the preparatory colleges, that would enable us in the course of a few years to have teachers emerging who would be prepared to enter schools all over the country, and we would then be able to attain a real mastery of the Irish language because those teachers would be able to teach all subjects through the native language.  When they would become competent as teachers I feel they would be more successful than the older teachers could be in the actual task of imparting instruction through the medium of Irish. 
     There are a few things I should like to say in connection with the Gaeltacht. In these circumstances, one of the things we ought to aim at is that the very best national teachers and the very best national schools will be found in the Gaeltacht, if we are to accept the principle that, both in the interests of the language and of the Gaeltacht areas themselves, the best thing we can do is to educate the   people.  That would be an answer to what Deputy Kissane said with reference to giving equal grants to teachers in the Gaeltacht.  To have the best schools and the best teachers in the Gaeltacht is most important and a lot of people do not realise that. 
     I heard very recently a man, who was very sympathetic to Irish, talking about a case in which a nun, who was the only nun very competent in Irish in a school in the Gaeltacht, was transferred by her Order to a bigger and more important school, where she would be teaching Irish.  He thought that was perfectly satisfactory; that nuns who were not so well up in Irish were perfectly all right for the Gaeltacht. Of course, the fact was that work was being done which was not so important in some big school in some town, and that the Gaeltacht children were not getting the respect for the language and the education in the language that they could have been given if the right point of view prevailed. 
     My own belief about the task of saving the language is that the City of Galway is a key point.  I think that if we cannot Gaelicise the City of Galway, where, according to the census, there is a forty-six per cent.  Irish-speaking population, with one of the biggest Irish-speaking areas adjacent to its borders, then we have no hope of Gaelicising towns like Kilkenny or Drogheda; that there is no chance of succeeding with the general task.  On the other hand, if we had even one town in the whole country that was Irish-speaking, a great many difficulties that at present exist would be to some extent removed.  For instance, one of the ways in which Welsh in any county in Wales is very much better than Irish is here is that in the shops and streets of the towns you can hear the Welsh language.  I remember being in Carnarvon once on a Bank Holiday, moving through the streets, which were crowded with people from the city and the country, and not hearing a single word of English spoken.  If you went into a shop you would not be addressed in the first instance in English.  There is a town life for Welsh there which made it possible to have weekly newspapers   with all the ordinary news in the language of the country.  If we could have even one town which is Irish-speaking the dangers that I see would be to a very large extent removed. I think that Galway is the urban area that ought to be and could be Gaelicised, and I think it ought to be the consistent policy of the Government to aim at that.  The very existence of the College there would be a big factor if it were Gaelicised.  I think there should be special pressure and inducements in respect of the technical, national and secondary schools in the City of Galway to induce them to fall in with the plan of Gaelicising that city. 
     In that connection, and it has also a broader bearing, I wonder would the Government think the time has arrived when there ought to be a national matriculation for University entrants, in order that the standard of Irish required for matriculation would be raised and there would not be a question of one institution which does not require it competing with an institution which does require it and the standard being kept down?  All the students going into Galway College then would have sufficient knowledge of Irish to take instruction in Irish, so that, according as Professors and Lecturers who were competent could be obtained, the work of the College could gradually be turned over to the Irish language.  I think that that particular matter has been mentioned before. It was a matter that obviously could be left over for a period.  But, I am inclined to think that the time has now come when, if there is to be progress in University work in Irish, it has to be faced.  Naturally, what I say would only apply to students who are the children of persons domiciled here. 
     The Minister referred to &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools.  There has been a steady increase. Apart from the Preparatory Colleges, however, I wonder is there any boys' boarding school that has become an &ldquo;A&rdquo; school?  I know that none had until recently, and, if none has, I believe that some effort should be made to provide further inducements   in that direction.  In that connection, I should like to mention one other matter.  The work of giving a full secondary course through Irish was an experimental matter when the Preparatory Colleges were set up.  It was necessary to have a minimum curriculum in the beginning, because of the difficulties, but I would be inclined to think that the time has arrived when the curriculum in the Preparatory Colleges might be extended somewhat; that, at any rate, students would be taught some Latin so that matriculation would be no difficulty to them later on.  In addition to that, as there has now to be a lower course in modern languages, there should be at least a lower course in French and German in some of them.  I think that while there are worse courses pursued in certain schools, courses that are essentially narrower than the course in the Preparatory Colleges, nevertheless the time has arrived when the Government might face the business of introducing some extra subjects in the Preparatory Colleges. 
     One of the things that we are faced with in this is in line with some of the things of which Deputy Dillon spoke. One of the difficulties that we are faced with is keeping standards up. In the effort to do something about Irish everywhere it had to be done. There is a danger that we would not require the work to be of as high a standard as it ought to be.  I think there are various Inspectors who are not as rigid, who have not as high ideas about the question of what should be required in Irish as they ought to have.  I believe it is necessary to give constant attention to the task of raising the standard of the work that is being done.  Necessarily, in the beginning, in many of the national schools the work in Irish had to be of a very low standard because the qualifications of the teachers were minimum qualifications.  Necessarily, also, in the secondary schools many teachers were not as highly competent in Irish as would be desirable and the standards had to be moderate standards. But the pressure ought to be to raise the standard, because if we were   to have a generation of people coming out of the schools, having learned Irish with only a very unsatisfactory grip of it, you might have effects upon public opinion that would not be all that we would desire. 
     There is one thing I should like to say in connection with the work of An Gum.  I have seen in the past lists of books that were in hands, as well as lists of books that had actually been published, and what I noticed was that apparently translators were not willing to undertake books that would be more difficult to translate, books in which there were difficulties of technical terms.  In the case of subjects that had not been dealt with or anything written on in Irish before I think there is a certain unevenness in the progress of the work.  I think that efforts ought to be made to give special inducements or put special pressure on translators to tackle some of the classes of work which they have been fighting shy of up to the present. 
     The Minister referred to the technical vocabularies which are being published and to the English-Irish dictionary which is being prepared by Father McKenna.  As I understand it, the dictionary that Father McKenna is preparing is an extension, an enlargement, of his phrase dictionary. Now, no matter how much an enlargement there may be of the phrase dictionary, which is a very valuable book&mdash;I am sure the enlargement will also be extremely valuable&mdash;there will still be left a gap unfilled.  If anyone goes through the last Ua Duinnin dictionary he must be struck by the enormous wealth of Irish words that are to be found there.  It might often happen that a person who wanted to discuss, either verbally or in writing, some rather unfamiliar subject, something that is not a fireside subject in the Gaeltacht, if he had time to go through the Ua Duinnin dictionary he would find the words to meet the want he felt, but unless he read the dictionary from beginning to end he might not light on the particular word he was in search of. 
     It would be a relatively easy task   to have a dictionary prepared which would, in fact, be a key to Ua Duinnin containing language examples that would enable a person who had the English word to turn it up and see if there was an equivalent in Ua Duinnin.  The task of preparing a key of that sort would require far less in the way of qualifications than, say, the work on which Father McKenna is engaged.  It is the sort of work that, I think, it would be relatively easy to find people competent to do and also work that could be done in a relatively short time.  I think it would be desirable if the Ministry would consider putting in hand a dictionary of that sort. 
     There is one other thing I would like to say, and it is that it is important to try to get all parents to take a reasonable point of view about the work that is being done in the schools in relation to Irish.  I think there is a terrible disposition to blame the Irish policy for things that it should not be blamed for, things with which it is in no way connected.  If a parent has a stupid child he does not believe that the child is stupid, but goes out proclaiming at the top of his voice that it is the dreadful Irish policy that is being pursued at the present time that is responsible.  If a teacher is in some way less efficient than the average in his profession, and if the results are not just as good as they are in other schools, the parents do not even look at the other schools, but blame the language policy.  In every country as far as I know there are terrible complaints about schools.  I have seen in English newspapers practically all the complaints about English schools that Deputy Dillon has made here.  I have seen how in Liverpool, I think, children coming from school cannot spell or tot up: that they are generally neglected, only that in Liverpool they have not the Irish language to blame. If anything could be done to try and get reason into the minds of parents, I think it would be well because one positive harm that is being done by the practice of always blaming the language policy in the schools is that if the children hear it attacked at home it means that they are not able to get   as much benefit out of the instruction in the schools as they ought to. 
     I am satisfied that, whatever changes do take place politically in the country, there is going to be no reversal of the policy of preserving the Irish language.  We might do harm, and harm could easily enough be done, as Deputy Dillon said, by a lack of discretion or a lack of consideration in carrying out the policy, but the result would not be what Deputy Dillon fears.  I think it would only be a forcible agitation for changes in the method by which the policy is being carried out.  I do not believe that the policy will be reversed, and I think if parents and everybody concerned could be convinced that here was something that was going to stand whatever political changes might take place, they might be induced to stop the educational sabotage that is involved in continually complaining in the presence of their children of the teaching of a subject which the children have to learn. 
     
      
       I was rather surprised at the onslaught that Deputy Dillon made on the national schools and on the national teachers.  I can only attribute it to complete ignorance on the Deputy's part as to the actual facts.  I have over twenty years' experience as a teacher.  I went through the period mentioned by Deputy Dillon, and I may say that I do not think at all that the standard of education to-day is lower than it was fifteen or 20 years ago, as Deputy Dillon said.  It appears to me that Deputy Dillon has drawn general conclusions from a few isolated examples, and I think that is absolutely unfair.  My own experience is that the standard to-day is as high as ever it was, and if it is not, I wonder are the inspectors of the national schools all hypocrites. They have classed many schools as highly efficient and many national teachers as highly efficient and quite a number of others as efficient.  Are the inspectors then all incompetent, or are they all hypocrites?  I do not think it is right for Deputy Dillon or for any Deputy to make such a sweeping statement about the national schools of the   country or the work done by the national teachers. 
       Then, again, the Deputy assumes that the teacher will not know any Irish.  Why does Deputy Dillon assume that the national teachers do not know any Irish?  He seems to think nobody can speak Irish except those who are natives of the Gaeltacht. I do not come from the Gaeltacht, but without any boasting whatever I think I can say this: That I can go into the Gaeltacht and carry on a conversation fluently with the people there.  I am not a star by any means and never was, but I know that there are hundreds and even thousands in the country who are quite capable of carrying on a conversation fluently with the people in the Gaeltacht.  I say, too, that the national teachers are quite capable of giving instruction in the national schools in history, geography and other subjects through the medium of the Irish language. Deputy Dillon referred to what I think he called &ldquo;Pidgin Irish.&rdquo; I do not know what he means. 
       When a teacher is capable of going to the Gaeltacht, and carrying on a conversation fluently in Irish I do not see why he should not be qualified to give instruction in Irish to his pupils in the different subjects he is teaching, or may have to teach.  If we are to accept Deputy Dillon's views, then, the nation will have to wait until some miracle occurs when Irish will have spread from the Gaeltacht to the Galltacht.  The people in the other counties, apparently, would have to do nothing until that happens and would have to pursue a policy of total inactivity in that respect.  That certainly cannot be.  The work of instruction in the Irish language must be carried on, or else cease, and, by the time Deputy Dillon's policy would have matured, there would be no Irish in the Galltacht.  I am not sure that there is not, to-day, a better spirit in the Galltacht than in the Gaeltacht and that there is not as much enthusiasm on the part of the teachers in the Galltacht as on the part of other teachers.  I believe there is. 
     
     I do not agree with Deputy Dillon in what he said about the lowering   of the state of education in the different subjects in the seventh standard.  From my own experience I know that that is not right; but there is one thing to which I would like to draw attention.  There is an idea, at the moment, and it comes from the Education Office, that pupils must be promoted no matter what their standard of intelligence.  It seems to be the general idea of the Minister's Inspectors that unless a pupil is described as mentally deficient he must be promoted to the higher standards.  I think that is wrong, and I think it is time it was stopped. There is no use suggesting that all pupils in a particular standard will be of the same intelligence, and it is ridiculous to force pupils, not fit for promotion, from one standard to a higher standard.  It is injurious to the unfit pupils promoted and also to the pupils fit to be promoted.  I think that policy should be changed.  It is the policy, at the moment, to force pupils into the higher standards whether they are fit or not.  If there is anything in what Deputy Dillon has said I say it is because pupils are promoted to higher standards for which they are not fit. 
     When pupils reach the seventh standard parents take them from school.  From the day I started as a national teacher I have been teaching Irish, and I never experienced any revolt. I have never seen the faintest sign of it though at one time I was teaching in a town that could not be described as a Gaeltacht town.  I have never seen any evidence of that revolt amongst the parents.  I heard what Deputy Blythe said, that parents who have rather stupid children complain of the advance of those children, but in these cases the parents themselves are not over-intelligent, and that is where you find the exception taken. As a general rule I found that there was no interference with the teacher or any other persons connected with education.  I do not think it is fair to say that there is a revolt against the Irish language.  There never has been any in my experience.  I would like that people speaking upon this subject should have some general knowledge   before they make statements of that kind, but those who speak about revolts have no such general knowledge. I do not intend to delay the House any longer as I know that many other Deputies are anxious to speak upon this subject.

       There is one matter under this Vote to which I would wish to allude.  It is in connection with the pensions paid to two officials of the Education Board.  These are two exteachers of board of guardians in Cork&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       May I enquire whether this is in order?  In my view this is a matter for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. 
     
     
      
       Is it provided for under this Vote? 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       Then if it is not provided for under this Vote it is out of Order. 
     
     
      
       My reason for raising the matter was that a sealed order sent to the council was signed by the Minister for Education. 
     
     
      
       Yes, when I was acting as substitute Minister for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. 
     
     
      
       I do not know whether I can go on with this&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I know the Deputy cannot if it is not provided for in this Vote. 
     
     
      
       The point I wish to make outside of that is that two teachers who were drawing money under this Vote are drawing pensions also&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       No, that is not the point. 
     
     
     
      
       But the salaries are on this Vote. 
     
     
      
       I must ask Deputy Corry to sit down. 
     
     
      
       Their salaries are on this Vote. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is raising a point about pensions. Has the Deputy anything to say to convince the House that these teachers should not be paid their salaries? 
     
     
      
       I have. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is raising a matter about the salaries of two teachers? 
     
     
      
       Yes.  These two teachers have been transferred or, if you wish, they have been sent from one school to another.  They are at present drawing salaries as principal teachers of two schools.  At the same time they are held to be entitled to large pensions from the Board of Guardians.  I maintain that they should not be employed as principal teachers while drawing pensions. 
     
     
      
       This is a matter for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  It is a question of superannuation under the Superannuation Act of 1919. 
     
     
      
       I am absolutely refusing to hear the Deputy on the matter of pensions.  I do not know what other matter he wants to raise. 
     
     
      
       Well, in that case the only matter I can raise on this Vote is as to whether two men at present in receipt of pensions should at the same time be employed by the Department of Education, thus drawing salaries and pensions together.  Is that in order? 
     
     
      
       The point the Deputy wants to raise is that they are employed as teachers.  I cannot consider under this Vote whether they are drawing pensions.  That is a matter outside the control of the Minister for Education. 
     
     
     
      
       The position is a peculiar one.  These two teachers were employed for a short period as teachers in the Union.  As a result of the amalgamation scheme their services in the Union ended.  Then they were immediately employed as principal teachers in two national schools which really is a transfer of their services from one school to another.  Then we have the position that these two teachers are employed under the Board of Education, and as such are drawing their salaries while they are also held to be entitled to large pensions under another Department.  That is a thing on which I would like to have a statement from the Minister for Education. One of these two gentlemen is held to be entitled to a salary of over £800 a year.  The other has a salary of £700 odd, and the ratepayers have to pay them in addition pensions of £80 and £74 a year.  Why two teachers in receipt of these large salaries should have pensions I cannot understand. Why these teachers should also be carried on the Vote for the Board of Education as principal teachers in national schools when there are undoubtedly plenty of well-educated young men through the country awaiting vacancies and awaiting employment, is a matter which I think the Minister should consider.  I understood that this matter could be dealt with under this Vote.  I do not wish to press it further, only to point out this discrepancy to the Minister.  When there are at present numbers of unemployed teachers in the country it is not right that men who are drawing pensions should be teaching at the same time.  I know there is any number of qualified national teachers quite fit to take over charge of these schools.  I do not see why that condition of affairs should continue, and that men should be unemployed whilst the teachers in these schools are actually in receipt of pensions.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter at once. 
     
     
      
       Nil a lan agam le ra ar an meastachan so; ach ta cupla ceist agam le cur ar an Aire Oideachais. An bhfuil an Ghaoluinn ag dul ar   agaidh ins na bun-scoileanna?

Mar an feidir leo e sin a dheanamh, ni eireoidh linn go deo na scoileanna do Ghaolu.  Is eageoir ar na leanbhai sa Ghalltacht gan aon Bhearla do labhairt leo i scoileanna na naoidheanan, na aon Bhearla do mhuineadh dhoibh agus gan aca fein ach Bearla, agus gan ach Bearla a labhairt agus a chlos aca lasmuigh de'n scoil.

       A Chinn Comhairle: When discussing these Estimates on a previous occasion I drew attention to a rather serious factor that one would like a little more attention directed to.  In many of our city national schools there is, at the moment, and has been in existence for some time, very serious overcrowding. The effect of that is obvious.  One of the outstanding effects is that it is bound to lower the standard of education in these particular schools.  Another   factor, which is of very serious importance, is that many parents are anxious to keep their boys and girls at school after the age of fourteen years.  They are told in those schools &mdash;I know a case that came to my knowledge within the last few weeks and that is still in existence&mdash;that they cannot be kept after fourteen years.  We are anxious to raise the standard of the school-leaving age, and we are anxious to raise the standard possessed by the pupils in these schools, but owing to the serious overcrowding we cannot get it done.  Those who were members of this House in 1927 and 1928 will recollect very clearly that, when we were discussing the School Attendance Act in those years, it was the unanimous opinion of the members that it was desirable, in the interests of young people and in the interests of industry, to raise the school-leaving age. 
       In that particular Bill the Minister had authority to raise the school-leaving age from fourteen to sixteen years, and to put it into force in areas where it is possible to do so, but the congestion in the schools has prevented that particular section of that Act from being put into force anywhere in the Free State that I know of.  The Minister pointed out very fairly that these schools were over-crowded at the moment, and that if we were to retain in the schools pupils who would leave in the ordinary way at fourteen up to the age of sixteen it would be impossible to take in the younger people&mdash;a difficulty that we find existing at the moment.  I would like the Minister, as I said, to give some serious attention to this matter. 
     
     Deputy Dillon has complained to-day, and complained with justice, that the standard possessed by our young people leaving the primary schools is much lower than it should be.  I hear that complaint commonly made by employers.  They say that the young people who come along to them are not properly educated. Possibly it is that employers expect more of young people to-day than they did in by-gone years, but whatever the cause be the fact remains   that complaints are made widely of the low standard of education possessed by young people coming into industry to-day.  Now, a Chinn Comhairle, we have had very considerable discussion on the question whether all education in our schools should be given through the medium of Irish.  That is the policy of the Department.  One has spoken on that particular aspect of this question in this House on many occasions, but I would like those who are in charge of the important work of education in our country to consider what is the object of education. Is it to give young people a thorough knowledge of Irish, or is it to prepare them for the task that lies before them in whatever sphere they may be placed?  It does not seem to me that the two objects are synonymous. 
     I have the greatest sympathy with enthusiasts like Deputy Blythe and others for the Irish language, but I would draw the attention of these enthusiasts to the fact that we must prepare the young people to face the conditions as we find them, not as we should like them to be, and in our enthusiasm we must not sacrifice the lives of these young people.  In our cities I have the greatest sympathy for the parents who complain that their young people come home from school where they are taught wholly through the medium of Irish, they are unable to assist those young people in the home work as they would like to do.  The whole of that home work&mdash;the whole of the school work&mdash;is taught through the medium of Irish.  Parents are unable to give them any instruction through the medium of that language and secondly they are debarred from giving the assistance to their children they would like to give to them.  Now I do not like, and I do not want, to stress this particular aspect of the problem unduly, but I would urge that in the minds of many too much attention is being devoted to the necessity for teaching Irish rather than preparing these people for the careers that lie before them. Now I pass on to another aspect of the educational problem that I have taken some interest in, and for which I would like some information from   the Minister.  I refer to the progress that is being made with vocational education. 
     The Minister will remember that in the report of the Technical Education Committee that was set up some five years ago considerable stress was laid on the importance of continuation and vocational education, and some efforts have been made to carry out their particular work, but I am afraid it is not being pressed with the enthusiasm which is necessary.  It is common knowledge that industry to-day requires bright, well-educated young people.  Any of us who make enquiries through the juvenile department of the Labour Exchange find that well-educated juveniles are much more easily placed than those who are more backward, and for that reason, in order to try and prepare these young people to get employment our object ought to be to try and train them to meet with conditions which will render them more readily absorbable into employment.  In the report of that important Commission it was recommended that vocational schools should be set up in the various areas and that young people who were not in employment between the ages of 13 and 16 ought to be compelled to attend these vocational schools.  In the vocational schools these young people would be taught what work is, and when they came along afterwards to an employer and the employer says to them &ldquo;What do you know about industry?&rdquo; They would be able to say: &ldquo;We have had training in a vocational school in particular forms of work and we have made considerable progress.&rdquo; 
     
      
       Would the Deputy guarantee them employment then? 
     
     
      
       I am afraid the question of guaranteeing employment does not arise.  What we want to do is to try and make young people, as I said, more readily absorbable into industry, and I do not think it needs any words of mine to stress for the Minister the difficulty a young person finds himself in who goes to an employer looking for work, and the employer says:  &ldquo;What do you know about work?&rdquo; If the young person says: &ldquo;I know nothing about work; I have not done any work,&rdquo; the employer naturally says: &ldquo;You are no use to me.&rdquo; 
       It is to meet that known difficulty&mdash; known just as well to the Minister as to others of us&mdash;that the recommendation was made in connection with vocational and continuation schools. What I want to know from the Minister is what progress has been made in connection with the development of vocational education.  I notice that in the Estimate for technical education, which covers vocational education, there is a decrease this year.  While there is a large increase in the Estimate for primary education, there is a decrease in the Estimate for technical instruction.  I agree that it is not a large decrease, but it was the feeling of the House in previous years that a little more could be spent on technical and vocational education with advantage to the country.  I do not say that too much is being spent at the moment on primary education, but I should like to see some reduction in the cost of primary education and a corresponding increase in the Estimate for vocational and technical education. 
     
     I have said that industry requires well educated young people.  I hope it will be the object of our education department to train our young people so as to make them more acceptable to industry.  Stress has been laid by Deputy Dillon on the fact that these young people ought to be trained in different trades.  I do not propose to enter into the details of that matter at present.  In the present condition of our trades, that would not be a very useful work.  The difficulty is that, after these young people have spent important years of their lives in training for particular trades, they are unable to get into those trades.  Some of our trades in the City of Dublin are confined entirely to the sons of those already engaged in them.  In the case of a number of other trades, there are limitations as to the numbers of young people who can be absorbed into them.  Positions must be kept in many of them for descendants of those   already in the trades and there are even limitations as to the numbers that can be absorbed into those trades. That is a very big problem and I do not want to go into it here.  But there would be no use in young people spending the most important years of their lives in preparing for particular industries unless they can obtain entrance to the industries selected. These are problems which the Minister might like to inquire into.  I am glad that his mind is turning in that direction, seeing that he asked &ldquo;can we guarantee them employment?&rdquo; I should like that young people fitted by nature for particular industries should have an opportunity of getting into those industries.  It is unfortunate that barriers should be placed in their way.  I should like to know from the Minister, when replying&mdash;I hope he will not mind saying it in English&mdash; what progress exactly has been made in the matters to which I have drawn attention. 
     
      
       Ni aontuim leis an meid adubhairt Mac Ui Dhioluin, Teachta, ach caithfidh me a admhail go raibh cuid den cheart aige. Caithfimid ar ndicheall do dheanamh chun na daoine in aiteacha ar fud na tire do shasu.  Dubhairt an tAire go raibh cuid maith sgolairi ag fagailt na scoileanna agus nach raibh ach beagan Gaedhilge acu.  Ta eagla orm gur fior san.  Ta a lan paisti ag fagailt na scoileanna, tar eis cuig no se bliana a chaitheamh ag foghluim na Gaedhilge, agus gan focal Gaedhilge acu.  Ni maith liom san a ra ach is fior e. 
     
     
      
       Ce'n sort muinteoiri ata sna sgoileanna san? 
     
     
      
       Ni fheadar.  Is minic a bhi me ag caint leis na paisti ar an mbothar agus ag iarraidh focla Gaedhilge do bhaint asta.  Ach do theip orm.  Nil a fhios agam ce ata ciontach leis sin.  Nuair a bhi me ag labhairt ar an meastachan so cupla bliain o shoin, dubhairt me nach raibh an sprid ceart sna scoileanna. Dubhairt an Teachta O Ciosain iniu   go raibh easbaidh sprid sa dteagasc i gcuid de na scoileanna.  Is baoghalach gur fior san.  Ta an Ghaedhilg a muineadh sna scoileanna mar abhar leighinn agus ta na paisti cortha dhi.  Is minic a deireann na paisti, nuair a cuirtear ceisteanna ortha, &ldquo;O!  an tsean-Ghaedhilg sin.&rdquo; Da mba rud e go raibh an sprid ceart acu, ni abrochadh siad sin.  Is baoghalach nach bhfuil an sprid ceart acu sna scoileanna agus go dti go mbeidh, ni bheidh aon dul ar aghaidh ar an dteangain.  Dubhairt Earnan de Blaghd, Teachta, go mba ceart iarracht do dheanamh chun na bailte mora do Ghaedhealu.  Ba dheacair sin do dheanamh.  Ta eagla orm nach mbeadh se in ar gcumas na siopadoiri, na dochtuiri agus na sagairt sna bailte mora do Ghaedhealu. 
       Every year we hear the same complaints&mdash;so far I have not heard them this year&mdash;on the question of Irish in the schools.  One complaint we do hear is about the question of books.  In these hard times we hear many complaints from poor people about books. Every year they have to buy so many shillings worth of books for their children.  The books used by one child this year cannot be used by the next child the following year and parents are put to very considerable expense in the purchase of new schoolbooks. Would it not be possible to alter that and go back to something like the old standard readers, so that the books could be passed on from one child to another as they moved from grade to grade.  It would save great expense. It might look a small thing to some, but it is a very big item in the budget of people in the country. 
     
     I wonder are we crowding too much into the primary course?  Is that one of the reasons for the complaints that are made about children coming from the primary schools who enter business life that their minds have been confused in an endeavour to cram too much into them?  Personally, I think that in the days when children in primary schools were taught mainly the three R's they had really a sounder foundation on which to build up their education in after life.  Children   coming from these schools now are so tired and so weary of study that they throw their books away when they leave and never make the slightest attempt to enlarge their education.  I think it would be better if they had a certain amount of learning, and if an effort were made to get them, when they leave school, to continue their education, instead of packing all that was possible into them, so that they go out into the world stale, so to speak, and with an absolute distaste for any education.  Deputy Good spoke of vocational education.  There is not much sign of it in the country.  The Deputy's argument with reference to vocational education was a rather good argument for a tariff policy.  If we educate young people vocationally we must have some place to put them afterwards.  Up to this our young people emigrated whether they were educated or not.  They cannot emigrate now, and if we teach them technically or vocationally we will have to find some place for them. 
     
      
       Would the Deputy enquire why we cannot get them into trades when they are trained? 
     
     
      
       Because we have not the trades. 
     
     
      
       We have trades, but we cannot get them into them. 
     
     
      
       If we trained them vocationally we would get them into trades. 
     
     
      
       Let the Deputy try.  I have been trying it for many years, and so have others. 
     
     
      
       That is a reason for giving them a good vocational and technical education.  The tendency so far in this country has been to make our young people seek positions away from trade and away from any form of industry.  They want to be civil servants, or to be in positions of a similar kind. 
     
     
      
       T.D.'s. 
     
     
      
       Yes, T.D.'s.  That   tendency should be ended.  We should endeavour to get more young people into manual work; to get out of the minds of our people the idea that manual work is degrading, and that nobody is respectable except those in what the Americans call &ldquo;white collar jobs.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Vocational education will do that. 
     
     
      
       That is why I am keen on seeing it going forward.  We want our young people educated into the belief that manual work is not degrading, and that a man can be a gentleman, and a thoroughly respectable member of society, although he works with his hands.  Our technical education has not been effective so far.  I am afraid that is due, perhaps, to the fact that there was no idea before it beyond making a certain number of young men in the country handy in making little things around a house, or providing amusement on winter evenings. I have been criticised for saying that, but we have had technical education here for 25 years and the results have not been much to boast of.  In the rural districts the agricultural classes are not well attended, and there is a disposition amongst practical farmers to despise the work of these classes. We should make every effort to get working farmers to take more advantage of these agricultural classes. They say we are sending around Instructors who do not know as much about the work as those they are sent to instruct.  I do not believe that at all.  Unfortunately the tendency amongst the agricultural population is to ridicule the instruction we are inclined to give them.  I do not know how that difficulty can be got over. The practical working farmer considers that the technical training we give is not suitable for his work. 
     
     Then there is the question of entrance examinations to the Civil Service. I think those who possess the Leaving Certificate with honours should be allowed to enter the Service without further examination.  It looks to me to be a duplication to insist on pupils passing another examination,   after passing that test, which should be ample to qualify for entrance to the Civil Service.  I move that the debate be adjourned. 
     
        Progress reported.  The Committee to sit again. 
     The Dail adjourned at 2 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 2nd November. 
   
   
     Ceist&mdash;Question.   Written Answer. - The Vincent Estate. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will arrange for an inspector to visit the holding of Michael Shanahan, Tomies, Beaufort, Killarney (Vincent Estate), and fix the boundary between this holding and the remaining Vincent Estate and incidentally to fix a rent on the portion of the holding recently sold by Michael Shanahan. 
     
     
      
       An application for the subdivision of the holding of Michael Shanahan in the townland of Tomies on the estate of A. R. Vincent has been received and is at present under consideration.  The holding has been inspected and the boundaries checked by a surveyor, and it is anticipated that the decision of the Land Commission regarding the subdivision and apportionment of the rent of the holding will be made at an early date.
