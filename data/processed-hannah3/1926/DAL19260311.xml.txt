Ach se tharluionn, amh, maidir leis na h-iarrathoiri go leir go n-eirionn leo sna comortaisi seo, go bhfuighid a bhfad nios mo marcanna na san 'sa Ghaedhilg.

     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CLAIM FOR VOLUNTEER BILLETING. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he can state when the claim of Mrs. Margaret Moran, Cornelstown, Dunboyne, Co. Meath, for billeting of Irish Volunteer Officers and men pre-Truce will be settled, and if he can state the cause of the delay in having this claim paid. 
     
     
      
       The claim referred to by the Deputy was duly submitted to the Committee set up under the Indemnity Act, 1924, but has not yet been considered by them.  I do not anticipate, however, that the Committee will find it possible to make a recommendation   for any payment.  The claim would appear to be entirely in respect of loss arising from the billeting or quartering of troops, and it is specifically provided by the Act that the Committee shall not take into consideration any loss or damage so arising. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CO. GALWAY COMPENSATION REPORT. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether a claim had been heard by Judge Doyle at Galway in October 1923, for compensation for the destruction of Dunmore Market House, County Galway; whether Judge Doyle had reported £475 8s. 0d. as being sufficient compensation for this destruction; whether this report had yet been considered by his Department, and, if so, with what result. 
     
     
      
       This award is subject to the condition that its amount shall be applied in reinstating the injured building, and payment can be made only as reinstatement proceeds. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ARREARS OF ANNUITIES. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what is the amount (a) chargeable to each county of the sum drawn from the Guarantee Fund in respect of purchasers' annuities in arrear; (b) to be credited to each county in respect of old arrears which have been recovered, (c) of arrears outstanding on the 16th February, 1926. 
     
     
      
       The reply to this question would involve the reading of two long columns of figures.  Perhaps it would meet the Deputy's requirements if I handed him a copy of the answer and circulated it in the Official Report. 
     
     
      
       I am satisfied. 
       Reply as follows:&mdash;

     In regard to the third part of the question, the amount of accumulated arrears outstanding on the 31st January, 1926, was £642,668 18s. 10d. 
     
      
       I agreed to accept the Minister's statement without having it read but I find that he has not answered my query (c). 
     
     
      
       I answered the question as I understood it.  I think the Deputy had better put down another question as I understood I gave him all the information that was asked for, except as to date.  The 16th February is the certifying date but the certification is in respect of 31st January. 
     
     
      
       What I wanted to know was how much was outstanding on 31st January?  The Minister gave   me how much was short this year and how much was paid on account of old arrears.  I want to know how much of the old arrears are outstanding now? 
     
     
      
       That is at the bottom of the table. 
     
     
      
       No; I have a blank sheet. 
     
     
      
       The amount is £642,668 18s. 10d. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy will get a copy of the correct sheet. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - EJECTMENTS AGAINST TENANTS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the number of ejectment orders granted against tenants in the Saorstat Courts for the past year. 
     
     
      
       To answer this question it would be necessary to circularise&mdash; 
       1.  Officers of the High Court; 
       2.  The twenty-seven Clerks of the Crown and Peace; 
       3.  The Chief Clerk of the Metropolitan District Court; 
       4.  One hundred and sixty District Court Clerks, 
       and all these officers would have to go over their books for the past year&mdash;a rather formidable task. 
       If the Deputy is satisfied that the information he seeks is worth the labour involved, I will have the necessary circulars issued and I would ask him to repeat the question in a fortnight or possibly three weeks' time. 
     
     
      
       I will repeat the query in a fortnight's time. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is satisfied that the information he seeks is worth the labour involved? 
     
     
      
       I am satisfied, because I am aware that there are a large number of tenants being evicted from slum tenements because, owing to unemployment, they have been unable to pay the rent. 
     
     
      
       Would it not be desirable to have a return of this kind   made annually to the Minister, as a matter of routine? 
     
     
      
       That is a matter of opinion.  While it does not appear definitely in the Estimates, the acquiring of information of this kind involves cost, and it is always a question of one's sense of proportion whether the information is worth the cost. 
     
     
      
       May I suggest that the Deputy would be satisfied if the Minister gave him information regarding Dublin only. 
     
     
      
       I was going to suggest that the Minister should, this day fortnight, give me information regarding the Dublin area. 
     
     
      
       I will give that information. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - MARKETS FOR IRISH LACE. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will state the number of markets for Irish-made lace in the Saorstat, and where same are situated. 
     
     
      
       There are no localised markets for lace in the Saorstat.  The lace is usually sold by the markers either on the spot to local agents or sent to dealers and exporters in Dublin, Cork and Sligo, for sale on consignment. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - EMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of German aliens in respect of whom permission has been given since August 1st, 1925, to prospective employers to engage them in industrial employment and assent has been given to the issue of permits authorising such aliens to land in Saorstat Eireann. 
     
     
      
       The number of German aliens in respect of whom permits have been granted since August 1st, 1925, is 245. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ENTRANCE TESTS IN TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Education whether his attention has been called to a statement by Mr. W. McMillan in a recent address at the Pembroke Technical Schools to the effect that 75 per cent. of the lads entering industrial life in Dublin were unable to pass a simple qualifying examination necessary to enter the Technical Schools; whether there are any statistics or information available in his Department which would substantiate or disprove this statement; whether he can say if there is a standard entrance examination for all technical schools, or is each school free to adopt its own standard, and if the Department's officials take any part in setting these examinations or prescribing what subjects are to be examined; whether there is in Dublin or elsewhere any form of leaving-certificate available for a child when leaving a National School which would show the standard of proficiency which such child has reached, and whether he has in contemplation any scheme whereby a leaving-certificate obtained by a child on the completion of his primary course would automatically secure his entrance to a Technical School. 
     
     
      
       My attention has been drawn to a newspaper report containing the statement referred to. There are no statistics available in my Department which would substantiate or disprove the statement.  There is no standard entrance examination for all Technical Schools; each school conducts its own examination in order to carry out one of the Department's regulations for Technical Schools and Classes, which requires that the pupils admitted should have reached the standard of education necessary to enable them to take full advantage of the instruction provided in the classes to which they seek admission.  The officials of my Department do not take part in the setting of these examinations but, when it is considered necessary, they check and revise the results. 
     
     There are two forms of certificate of the nature referred to in the latter part   of the Deputy's question.  One of these called the &ldquo;Certificate of Merit,&rdquo; may be awarded under Rule 119 (c) of the Code for National Schools to a pupil over 13 years of age who has been enrolled for one year in the Seventh Standard of a National School and who, in the opinion of the Inspector, has attained to a satisfactory standard in English, Arithmetic and Geography; applications for this form of certificate are very rarely received.  The second form of certificate is available for pupils leaving a primary school in the Dublin district; it is called the &ldquo;Higher Grade Certificate&rdquo; and is awarded by a committee of representative teachers, in association with the Department's Inspector, to pupils who have attended regularly for at least one year in the sixth or a higher class, and have reached a satisfactory standard in the subjects of the programme. The authorities of the City of Dublin Technical Schools, of the School of Commerce, Rathmines, and of the Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock and Pembroke Urban Technical Schools, exempt holders of the higher grade certificate from their entrance examinations.  In addition, the Blackrock Technical School grants free exhibitions to holders of this certificate. 
     The question of the advisability of making arrangements for the issue of a Primary School Leaving Certificate on the lines implied in the Deputy's question will receive consideration. 
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that the statement referred to was embodied in the report of the Industrial Education Conference held in Dublin in 1917, at which Conference Mr. MacMillan was a member; is the Minister also aware that the Dublin National Teachers' Association was also represented at that Conference and agreed to the report containing this statement; is the Minister further aware that the Commissioners of National Education were also represented at that Conference and approved of the statement referred to? 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that the statement, as reported in the newspapers, had reference to the   present state of affairs rather than to the position ten years ago? 
     
     
      
       There is no qualification of time whatever in the statement as reported in the newspapers. What Mr. MacMillan actually said I do not know.  In the report in the newspapers, there is no reference whatever to 1917, and anyone reading it would be under the impression that it referred to statistics dealing with the year 1924 or the year 1925. 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister say if there was any compulsory Irish in the national schools when that report was issued, or how far Irish was responsible for the state of affairs then? 
     
     
      
       I cannot divulge where the information came from.  If Deputy O'Connell, or Deputy Baxter, refers to Deputy Sean Good&mdash; (laughter)&mdash;perhaps he might help them in the matter. 
     
     
      
       Might I ask the Minister if he has read this report referred to?  If he has not, I can assure him that he might read it with much interest. 
     
     
      
       I shall certainly read it with interest. 
     
     
      
       I wish to withdraw question 9, as I am informed a settlement has been arrived at in the case. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION IN CASTLETOWN-BEREHAVEN. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been drawn to recent outbreaks of enteric and typhoid fever in Castletown-Berehaven, Co. Cork, resulting in the death of some patients; whether he is aware that in one case a patient had died before trained nurses had arrived to take charge of the cases; whether he is further aware that hospital accommodation at the County Home, Clonakilty, is over ninety miles away, and whether, seeing that the local hospital at Castletown-Berehaven is occupied by National Troops, to the serious detriment of the sick poor of the district, and that the local medical officer   of health has intimated his intention of resigning if the above state of affairs is allowed to continue, the Minister will state what steps he intends to take to provide suitable accommodation for the sick poor of the district. 
     
     
      
       I regret that I am not yet in possession of the full facts which would enable me to reply satisfactorily.  If the Deputy will be so good as to repeat the question in a week, I hope to be able to reply fully. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CO. GALWAY APPOINTMENT. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, and in what circumstances, sanction has been given to the appointment as Secretary of the Galway County Council of a person reported by the Civil Service Commission as not possessing a competent knowledge of Irish for the position, in accordance with the advertisement issued by the Galway County Council. 
     
     
      
       On the decease of the late County Secretary, the County Council of Galway in May last promoted to the position their accountant, who had been in their service for a long number of years and had frequently deputised in a satisfactory way for the late Secretary. 
       On the suggestion of my Department the Council subsequently agreed to advertise the position.  They stipulated, inter alia, that a knowledge of Irish sufficient to conduct the Council's business in that language would be required. 
     
     The advertisement subsequently issued stipulated &ldquo;a competent knowledge of Irish.&rdquo;  The Civil Service Commission in September reported that no candidate had a really competent knowledge of Irish.  They did not say that the candidate in question had no knowledge of the language.  Subsequently the County Council issued a fresh advertisement requiring &ldquo;a working knowledge of Irish,&rdquo; and on 14th November, 1925, again appointed the accountant after expressing themselves   as satisfied that his knowledge of Irish was then sufficient. 
     The gentleman in question has some knowledge of Irish and has conducted business in the language.  Otherwise, he is a competent official, and on the 23rd ultimo I agreed to his appointment on probation with the object of enabling him to improve his knowledge of the language. 
     
      
       Can the Minister say why the Civil Service Commission, having been called into this matter, were subsequently ignored? 
     
     
      
       Owing to the action of the county council in re-appointing him, I did not think it necessary to call on the Civil Service Commission. 
     
     
      
       Has the Minister any knowledge of how many officials competent in Irish were employed in the Department of Defence while Deputy Mulcahy was Minister? 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister say whether, when applications were in in response to the second advertisement a third advertisement was issued changing the terms of appointment and resulting in the withdrawal of some of the applications that were sent in in reply to the second advertisement? 
     
     
      
       I believe that was the fact. 
     
     
      
       Are we to understand that the Minister approved of the terms of appointment notified in the third advertisement, changing the conditions of the second advertisement, and that the change probably resulted in competent Irish scholars who had made application under the second advertisement being prevented from accepting the appointment, or who were not willing to accept it under the terms of the third advertisement? 
     
     
      
       The change was not such as would have justified me in refusing to accept the Council's request in the matter, and I am not aware of the fact that it made any difference or that we would have candidates who   would be more competent or have a better knowledge of Irish. 
     
     
      
       Was not the change a reduction in salary and was it not an effort in the way of economy? 
     
     
      
       That is the fact. 
     
     
      
       Is not Mr. Fogarty, who was appointed, drawing two salaries at present? 
     
     
      
       That question does not arise now. 
     
     
      
       It arises out of Deputy Cooper's remark. 
     
     
      
       Arising out of Deputy Cosgrave's remark, is the Minister aware that there were a number of competent Irish speakers in the Department of Defence? 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - LORRY TRAFFIC ON ROADS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the growing burden of local taxation is mainly due to damage caused by lorry and motor traffic on roads, and whether, as the roads were not made for such exceptionally heavy traffic, he will take steps to introduce legislation to ensure that lorries capable of carrying more than one ton will bear their due share of the increased cost of upkeep of the roads. 
     
     
      
       From the figures available in regard to the cost of road maintenance and construction at the present time and, say ten years ago, the increased cost is due to the rise in expenditure on wages and materials.  The introduction of legislation affecting motor vehicles is a matter for the Minister for Finance. 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister consider the advisability of going a step further than that suggested by Deputy Cosgrave, namely, limiting all motor traffic to lorries carrying one ton?  I would suggest to the Minister that the present condition of the roads is largely due to traffic by motor lorries? 
     
     
      
       I think that is also a question for the Minister for Finance. 
     
     
     
      
       Would the Minister say if the Roads Committee of his Department had this matter under consideration for a considerable time, and if he has received any representations under the 1925 Act from any County Council in the Saorstat asking for permission to prohibit heavy motor lorry traffic on any of their roads?  What is the result of their deliberations? 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister consider the advisability of making regulations whereby the roads were only to be intended for prams? 
     
     
      
       I would want notice of Deputy Corish's question. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ACQUIREMENT OF CO. GALWAY LANDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether the lands known as the Martyn Estate, situated at Lisduff, Dunmore, Co. Galway, have been yet acquired by the Land Commission; if so, if he will state whether there is any possibility of their being divided in time for spring sowing, and, if not, whether he will state what is the present position of the matter. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission have taken steps with a view to the acquisition of lands situate in the townland of Lisduff on the estate of John Martyn, County Galway, and are negotiating with the owner in regard to the matter. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - INSPECTION OF CO. KILDARE LANDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if the following lands, situate in County Kildare, in the possession of members of the Verschoyle family, are non-residential and are available for division amongst uneconomic landholders, evicted tenants, and landless men, viz., Kilberry, about four hundred acres, in which are included four farms from which families named O'Beirne, Hughes, Cummins and Nolan have been evicted; Cloney, three hundred acres, and Shaen, seventy acres; and if he   will direct the inspection of those lands by the staff of the Land Commission with a view to their division. 
     
     
      
       If the lands referred to by the Deputy are the lands which were purchased by George Gilmore, W.H.F. Verschoyle and G.J.F. Verschoyle, these lands are subject to land purchase annuities, and the Commissioners do not propose to acquire them. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that the four evicted tenants named in the question, or their representatives, are without any land at present, and would it be possible to acquire any lands on the Verschoyle property in order to give them a home and a means of livelihood? 
     
     
      
       The question as to whether other land can be acquired in the neighbourhood of this property belonging to different owners is another question of which I will require notice. I take it that the Deputy does not suggest that the Land Commission could acquire compulsorily land which is subject to land purchase annuities. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ACQUIREMENT OF CO. MEATH LANDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether the Land Commission have taken any steps to acquire the lands of Colonel Reginald Dashwood, comprising Johnsbrook, Cloucat, and Druminallistrin, situated in the Barony of Upper Kells, and County of Meath, and if he can state how far the activities of the Land Commission have advanced towards the acquisition of these lands. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission are making enquiries as to the suitability of the lands referred to, for acquisition under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he can state what steps, if any, have been taken by the Land Commission to acquire the lands of Barry at Dangan, Summerhill, Co. Meath, and if it is intended to set aside portion of these   lands as a cow plot for the accommodation of labourers and others who have cows and calves. 
     
     
      
       The lands referred to have been inspected and the question of their acquisition by the Land Commission is under consideration. 
       In the division of lands acquired by the Commissioners applications from deserving applicants will receive consideration. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware of the very serious congestion existing in and around Trim, and if it is intended to acquire the lands of Kennedy at Trim to relieve congestion and to make available a substantial portion of same for a cow plot for the accommodation of labourers and others resident in and around the town of Trim. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission have gazetted the lands of Ardanew on the Kennedy estate as lands which will, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, be vested in the Land Commission. 
       In the division of the lands applications from deserving applicants in the district will receive consideration. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that in taking depositions from local people preparatory to the division of the Sir Nugent Everard Estate at Ballyhist, Kells, Co. Meath, the Land Commission Inspector failed to call to the men who lost their employment through the acquisition of this estate, and whether it is the intention of the Land Commission to ignore the claims of these men, who number eleven, and whether he will take the necessary steps to see that they get allotments or be otherwise compensated for their loss of employment. 
     
     
      
       Sir Nugent Everard's Estate has not yet been vested in the Land Commission.  When the lands are being divided the case of employees will be fully considered. 
     
     
      
       Arising out of that answer, would the Minister say if an inspector from the Land Commission   has been down to that area and taken depositions from people in the locality with a view to the division of the land? 
     
     
      
       The implication is that the land has been valued but not vested.  If it has been valued, of course, an inspector has been there to prepare the valuation, but I think it unlikely at this stage that an inspector would be preparing a scheme for the division of the lands before vesting.  I have no special information, and I would have to inquire as to that. 
     
   
   
     EXPORT CATTLE TRADE. 
     
      
       Might I ask the Minister for Lands and Agriculture when he is likely to be in a position to give certain information regarding the export of cattle prior to 1914, which he promised. 
     
     
      
       I understood the information had reached the office.  If not I will undertake to see that it reaches the office to-day. 
     
   
   
     REDUCTION OF NATIONAL EXPENDITURE&mdash;MOTION BY DEPUTY O'MARA. 
     
      
       In view of the fact that the Dail is likely to adjourn over next week, may I ask the Minister for Finance if he will be ready to take the notice standing in my name to-morrow? It would be of great assistance to him in keeping the Estimates down this year. 
     
     
      
       With reference to Deputy O'Mara's question, I understand that certain Deputies have made arrangements to go away early to-morrow, and I am sure that would disappoint Deputy O'Mara in the taking of a division that I am sure will arise in connection with his motion.  In order to afford him an opportunity of appealing to the largest number of members of Dail Eireann that it is possible to collect, I think consideration of the motion had better take place before a full House.  I would not like   to disappoint the Deputy in that connection, and if it meets with his approval I should say that the motion could come before the Dail when the Estimates are under consideration.  I do not think it would be possible for the Executive Council to alter the Estimates that have been printed and that will be in the hands of Deputies to-morrow. I should say that if we had had earlier intimation we would have afforded the Deputy an earlier opportunity of considering it. 
     
     
      
       Does the President really think that there will be any necessity for a division on the motion?  Is there any opposition to it? 
     
     
      
       I hope to have the support of the whole House for my motion. 
     
     
      
       With regard to the intentions of the Government as to sittings, are we to sit to-morrow or next week? 
     
     
      
       I anticipate that it will be possible to take the adjournment at an earlier hour than 8.30 this evening.  There are but three items on the agenda, and I propose when the business has been disposed of to move the adjournment until the 23rd inst. 
     
   
   
     CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES. 
     
      
       As we are to have a comparatively long adjournment, can the President make any statement as to the suggested conference between employers and employees with a view to preventing industrial disputes?  This matter was mooted at Christmas, and as nothing more has been heard on the subject will he take advantage of this respite in our work to bring representatives of both sides together to see if anything can be done?  We finished the last session with expressions of good-will, but nothing has been done. 
     
     
      
       Is the President aware that many employers, private employers and particularly public bodies, are disowning and dishonouring national and local agreements that were entered into with regard to wages? 
     
     
     
      
       I am not aware of that, and as regards the other matter raised by Deputy Cooper I should say that I have been in correspondence with Deputy Johnson and Deputy Good on the question.  I think that the last letter I wrote on the subject was written about a week ago, and I think in that letter I expressed the view that having had representations from the Deputies in question I was not satisfied that there was an understanding as to the subject matter of the conference. I think there was a misunderstanding, or a misinterpretation.  In any case, as far as I can see, something more definite should have been arrived at in connection with the conference here in the Dail, because there were two different viewpoints.  Speaking from recollection, and not having the files before me, and not having anticipated the question, I should say it was not clear to me that the conference one Deputy had in mind was the conference the other Deputy had in mind. 
     
     
      
       If there is a misunderstanding will the President try and remove it? 
     
     
      
       I think I went into that question rather fully on two occasions in the Dail last year, or the year before.  I said this is primarily a matter between the two persons concerned, the employers on the one hand and the employees on the other, or their respective representatives.  To my mind at that time, and my opinion has not changed since, any understanding arrived at should be an understanding arising out of an effort on the part of these two sides.  If the Government were brought into it each side would look to the Government to fill up something. That is not the sort of beginning that ought to be made.  I think I laid that down more clearly on other occasions, that any move for a settlement or understanding should be between the two parties without the intervention of a third party. 
     
     
      
       Has the President ever been at a fair and seen a man trying to sell a cow, or a man trying to buy a cow, and a third party trying to   get them to come together and split the difference?  Does he not think that is a function the State might fulfil? 
     
     
      
       I was at a fair on one occasion and I transacted business without the assistance of a third party. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps it might be desirable, if the President and Deputy Good are willing, that the correspondence that has taken place should be published. 
     
     
      
       Would the President state for the information of the Dail and the country whether in these discussions there is a beating about the bush between the two parties, or whether there is an indication on the part of either side to come together with the desire to lay the foundation of a better state of things? 
     
     
      
       I should say on both sides there was a profound desire to have a better understanding as to methods to be adopted.  I think the differences in connection with the matter could be settled without bringing in a third party.  The desire is there equally pronounced on both sides to bring about an understanding as to differences in detail. 
     
     
      
       I threw out a suggestion more than twelve months ago that this conference ought to take place in the interests of industry in the State.  I renewed that suggestion in December last, and I must say I am profoundly disappointed the conference has not taken place. 
     
     
      
       In view of that statement I think I might again repeat my request that the President and Deputy Good would remove any obligation of confidence in respect of the correspondence that has taken place. 
     
     
      
       On that point I am not an interested party, and I am not going to throw my weight in favour of the correspondence being published, or against it.  It is a matter of indifference to me.  I do not think any useful purpose would be served by publishing the correspondence.  I think the publication of correspondence   which is marked &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; is not likely to create an atmosphere for the better consideration of such matters in the future.  I think if a further effort were made to find common ground and not make a stand on certain strong feelings in the matter much better work would be done. 
     
     
      
       Of course the matter cannot be left where it is.  Deputy Good has expressed grave disappointment in view of the fact that on two occasions he raised this question and nothing has come of it.  The inference of the public would be that in view of no conference the responsibility would be with me. I request permission for the publication of the correspondence so that the public would know where the blame lies, if any blame lies anywhere. 
     
     
      
       I do not see that much good could come of that.  There would be two points of view even after the publication of the correspondence as to who was right and who was wrong.  Would it not be possible to get from Deputy Johnson and Deputy Good a statement as to whether they, on behalf of their respective parties, are prepared to meet and discuss the difficulties that have kept them apart? If the papers are published one side or the other may gain an advantage, but that is not going to get us any nearer to a solution of the problem.  If there are differences, can Deputy Good or Deputy Johnson say if anything will be done towards a solution?  Are they prepared to take the bold step of indicating that they will meet to discuss their difficulties? 
     
     
      
       To discuss what? 
     
     
      
       The Deputy should understand that an offer to meet was made here.  The question was to meet for what purpose and under what conditions. 
     
     
      
       That is the point. 
     
   
   
     FORTHCOMING LEGISLATION. 
     
      
       Before we proceed to the ordinary business I would ask the President to give us some idea of the Bills that will be introduced when   the House reassembles.  Is there any hope that a Bill for the relief of Dublin jurors will be introduced?  Will the Army Pensions Act be extended to deal with tubercular and accident cases? 
     
     
      
       The Jurors Bill is in course of drafting.  It is not an easy Bill to deal with and it cannot be hurried.  I hope to introduce it after Easter&mdash;soon after Easter.  It is one of the Bills the draughtsman is at present engaged on. 
     
     
      
       Has the Minister for Defence any hope that a Bill for the relief of tubercular and accident cases amongst ex-National Army men will be brought in soon? 
     
     
      
       An amending Bill in connection with the 1923 Act is being prepared.  It will be brought in as soon as possible after Easter.  I cannot indicate the scope of the Bill at the moment. 
     
   
   
     DEPUTY O'MARA'S MOTION. 
     
      
       I would like to ask whether the question put to the President by Deputy James O'Mara has been disposed of? 
     
     
      
       I understood the agreement was that the House would adjourn this evening until the 23rd March.  In that case Deputy O'Mara's motion would be put down for consideration on the 24th March, during Private Deputies' time, if it were confined to Private Deputies' time. 
     
     
      
       If I am allowed to bring forward the motion on the 24th, I am quite satisfied. 
     
     
      
       In view of the fact that there will be only one-and-a-half hours available on the 24th, and that this is a motion upon which many Deputies will be almost certain to speak, will the President consider the advisability of allocating some of the Government time, if necessary? 
     
     
      
       The Government business will be the consideration of a Vote on Account, and the Central Fund Bill.  As I understand it, the motion is very little different from the Estimates. 
     
     
     
      
       I agree with the President, to a certain extent, that very much the same speeches can be made on the motion and on the Vote on Account and the Central Fund Bill; but he might inoculate himself against speeches on the Central Fund Bill by allowing full discussion on Deputy O'Mara's motion. 
     
     
      
       One might as well read the &ldquo;Independent.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       There is very little time left between the 23rd and the 31st March, yet in that period Bills have to pass through two Houses? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       In the circumstances time should not be wasted in holidays. 
     
     
      
       Does the President refuse to give me a day on which I can move my motion? 
     
     
      
       I do not know that I should go to any great length to point out to Deputy O'Mara that the Central Fund Bill is a matter of very great importance.  Whatever economies may be effected in the national expenditure, I am sure Deputy O'Mara will admit that the necessary services of the State must be carried on.  Unless that Bill is disposed of during the week before the 1st April, the Minister for Finance cannot issue a penny in payment; he must have authority.  I leave it to the judgment of the House whether one item is more important than the other.  In my view the Central Fund Bill is the more important matter. Whoever would occupy my office, he could have no other answer to make. 
     
     
      
       I recognise it is of great importance to the Ministry to get money from the House.  I also recognise it is of great importance to the House to keep control over expenditure. There are other matters that require to be discussed on the Vote on Account. My motion is a very definite one, and I want to get an expression from the House upon it.  There is no necessity for the House to adjourn to-morrow and I think my motion could be discussed to-morrow. 
     
     
     
      
       Does the President consider it right to discourage the new-found zeal of the Deputy? 
     
     
      
       The House could re-assemble on the 22nd March for the consideration of this motion, if it so desires.  I am prepared to leave it an open question. 
     
     
      
       I am not satisfied that there is any reason for not meeting to-morrow.  There is no assurance that the business on the Orders of the Day will be disposed of to-day.  I think we ought to meet to-morrow, especially in view of the proposal that Deputy O'Mara is putting forward for consideration. In his motion he is going to prove that the whole surplus income of the people above the mere subsistence level is absorbed by the present taxation.  If the Deputy can prove that it will make a great difference to the attitude of other Deputies with regard to taxation and future estimates. 
     
     
      
       I handed in an amendment to this motion.  Apparently it has not yet been circulated amongst Deputies.  I suggest that this motion is likely to give rise to very considerable discussion.  It is a matter of first-class importance to the country.  I have not been influenced in the slightest degree by newspaper stunts in regard to taxation and economy.  I suggest the President should allocate a day next week for the consideration of this matter. Why not March 18th, the day after St. Patrick's Day? 
     
     
      
       Or the day before? 
     
     
      
       I do not think one and a half hours on the 23rd March would be sufficient; the discussion could not be finished in that period. 
     
     
      
       Let us hear the Deputy's amendment. 
     
     
      
       I want all the week from the 23rd March for Government business, with the exception of whatever time is allotted for Private Business.  If additional time is needed, I am prepared to leave it to the House to ask for that extra time. 
     
     
     
      
       I think there is something in Deputy Heffernan's suggestion that we should meet next week. 
     
     
      
       If the House meets on the 23rd March it will have to take up the Vote on Account and subsequently a Central Fund Bill which will have to be put through all its stages more rapidly than an ordinary Bill.  A discussion on the Vote on Account would be almost exactly the same as a discussion on Deputy O'Mara's motion.  There are two questions and on each of these questions the same debate arises.  You could get the whole debate on either of them by passing one without debate.  If Deputy O'Mara's motion were carried unanimously without debate, then the debate would arise on the Vote on Account; if the Vote on Account were carried without debate, sufficient time would then be available for a debate on Deputy O'Mara's motion. 
     
     
      
       What about my amendment, which may not be carried unanimously? 
     
     
      
       If the Vote on Account were agreed Deputy Heffernan's amendment to this motion would be discussed in due course, that is if it is a proper amendment relative to the motion it will come up for discussion in due course on the motion. 
     
     
      
       It could not be discussed on the Vote on Account. 
     
     
      
       I will read Deputy Heffernan's amendment; it is:&mdash; 
       To delete all words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; where it first occurs and insert in their place the following words:&mdash; 
     
     &ldquo;In view of the depressed condition of the agricultural industry and its reactions on trade and commerce with resultant unemployment, the Dail is of opinion that a reduction in national expenditure is essential, and is of opinion that the most expeditious and effective means of bringing this about is by the appointment of a committee of independent experts to examine into departmental expenditure and organisation, with a   view to making recommendations which, when carried out, will result in more economical administration and consequent reduction in expenditure.&rdquo; 
     
      
       Would it be fair either to debate on the Vote on Account or on the motion of Deputy O'Mara to put the two together? 
     
     
      
       Which two? 
     
     
      
       To take a debate on Deputy O'Mara's motion in conjunction with the discussion on the Vote on Account.  After all we recognise that certain monies will be required, but from the fact that that is accepted by the Dail it is not to be inferred that there is no reason for raising the question Deputy O'Mara has raised and for putting forward arguments in support of it.  It cannot be said that you can have a discussion on both and that one must be put against the other.  That is very likely what it will come about. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps it is always a mistake to attempt to explain.  I am sorry if my attempt at explanation has been misunderstood.  I did not suggest that Deputy O'Mara's motion and the motion for a Vote on Account should be taken together.  I suggested that if the Vote on Account were passed, taken out of the way as it were, you would have a whole week for the discussion of Deputy O'Mara's motion. 
     
     
      
       There were certain Bills referred to the date on which we resume, so this would not be the only business to be discussed by the Dail. I urge on the President that this matter has now been thrown open to public discussion.  It will be the subject of animated discussion in the papers and most of the materials that will be used in the course of the discussion might be silenced if a debate on the subject took place here to-morrow.  A good deal of wasted time and energy and ink would be saved if we could have a debate here to-morrow. 
     
     
      
       My motion raises a perfectly plain issue.  On a Vote on Account anything could be spoken of   and speeches could be made that have no reference to the motion on the paper and the Ceann Comhairle will not, under the rules of order, be able to stop speakers discussing practically anything.  If the Government are willing to discuss this matter of economy, and I have no doubt they are willing to discuss it, and to take a plain and simple discussion on a straightforward vote as to how economy will be best effected, then the Government should not hesitate to give me an opportunity for the discussion of my motion.  I have asked for that opportunity on Private Members' Day next week, but I should not hesitate to raise it if I was given the opportunity in Private Members' time to-morrow. 
     
     
      
       The question to be decided is the motion of the President, that the Dail, at its rising to-day, shall adjourn until March 23rd or whether we meet to-morrow. 
     
     
      
       I urge it would be better to take this motion to-morrow or on the 18th and to get done with it.  Deputy Corish does not agree with me, but we all know it has been done to death in the Press and a good deal has been spoken and written about this matter by people who do not believe it themselves.  Now that action has been taken on the matter by a member of the Government Party, if the Government are not prepared to face the issue, they will only give people in the country who are anxious to make capital out of everything, a chance to say that they are not prepared to face it.  The sooner the Dail faces this the better and the sooner that everything is said on every side that can be said the better, and then I believe there will be a clearer air for the discussion of the estimates and the Vote on Account later on. 
     
     
      
       Would it not be much more reasonable if people were made to understand that if this matter wants discussion it ought to have been discussed a couple of months ago, and that it is unreasonable to   bring discussions of this particular kind forward now, and that we should leave the ordinary routine to deal with matters of this nature?  If there are points that would be raised by this motion with regard to expenditure is not the proper place to raise them on the Vote on Account or the accompanying Bill.  I think it would be a much better way to clear the air to make people understand that we were accepting the President's motion with regard to the session for the reason that proper and systematic discussion, in an ordered way, will arise in the debate on the Vote on Account, and that if discussions are wanted on motions of this kind the time to take them is not when we are in the middle of a financial discussion, but two or three or four or six months before that. 
     
     
      
       I want to explain my point of view.  I had it in mind for the past two or three months to put down a motion of this kind.  I did not put down this motion because the economic stunt was being run to death in the Press and the natural inference would be that I was taking my headline from the papers.  I quite recognise the newspapers are entitled to give a heading, still I think the good has been taken out of this very matter by the fact that it is over-discussed and over-emphasised. The Minister for Finance will be bringing forward his Budget next month and he might be influenced in the decision arrived at with regard to his Budget, by the discussions in the Dail and the statements that would be made here in that discussion, and while I recognise it is a little late I think it is not too late, but I think a postponement of this matter to the 23rd would be putting it back too far and too close to the introduction of the Budget.  I suggest the best way the Minister could meet us would be to have a discussion to-morrow.  To-morrow would give us a good opportunity for the discussion for this motion and my amendment to the motion. 
     
     
      
       Does the Deputy consider that the 12th March is the proper date to start a discussion with   a view to making the Minister for Finance change his whole outlook on the Budget? 
     
     
      
       I have suggested meeting on the 23rd March.  I am fairly well satisfied, from what I have heard from members generally, that the attendance on Friday is not regarded as the best attendance during the week&mdash;that there is a disposition to get away on Friday.  An understanding was arrived at during this week that there would be no business for Friday.  This motion is down for Wednesday, 17th March.  If Deputy O'Mara had come to me during the week and informed me that he was putting down this motion and if I had failed to explain to him that the Constitution and the Standing Orders prescribed certain dates for the presentation of estimates, that the presentation of estimates involved the consideration of them long before their presentation&mdash;that little short of the magician's wand could effect the purpose of this resolution&mdash; then we might have had this motion put down for to-morrow and notice given to members so that they would not make appointments elsewhere for to-morrow.  That was not done.  I am one of those who are utterly indifferent to ramps about things.  There has been an economy ramp.  There have been statements by members of local authorities who have not had, perhaps, the moral courage to stand up to their own difficulties in various places&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       And by members of the Dail, too. 
     
     
      
       They say that Government expenditure must be reduced but they do not indicate in what direction we can reduce it.  One way would be to stop education. 
     
     
      
       Are we discussing the motion now? 
     
     
      
       I am discussing the merits of the motion. 
     
     
      
       May I move it before the President discusses the merits of it? 
     
     
      
       I was going to say to Deputy O'Mara&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
     
      
       On a point of order, may I not move the motion before the President discusses it? 
     
     
      
       The Deputy should have moved it three months ago. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy should have moved it himself. 
     
     
      
       I was here; the Deputy was not. 
     
     
      
       Why did the Deputy not move it then? 
     
     
      
       I have no interest in the Deputy's motion. 
     
     
      
       The motion is that the Dail on rising to-day stands adjourned until March 23rd, and the merits or demerits of Deputy O'Mara's motion do not arise.  Since I cannot give Deputy O'Mara an opportunity of explaining the merits of the motion perhaps it would be better that the demerits of the motion should not be dilated upon. 
     
     
      
       I wanted to make plain what the idea was in not affording Government time for this motion.  If the Dail desires to meet any day next week to consider this motion I have no objection.  I am a private member in that respect, and it is open to every Deputy to vote in any way he wishes with regard to that.  It is a matter for Deputies, having regard to the fact that the Central Fund Bill will be before the Dail the following week, whether the importance of this motion is such as to justify further expenditure in bringing Deputies here at a time when economy is the first consideration.  (Deputies: &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;) 
     
     
      
       The Government do not always consider that. 
     
     
      
       I think it necessary to say that I know nothing of any understanding about not meeting to-morrow or even next week.  I do not know whether the President suggests that there was an understanding between Parties&mdash; 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
     
      
       &mdash;or an understanding between the President and his own Party.  There was no understanding that we should not meet to-morrow and there will be no additional expense on the State if we do meet to-morrow. 
     
     
      
       If this motion is not passed, does that mean that the Dail will meet to-morrow or, if I wish, that the Dail should meet to-morrow; is it in order for me to propose that it should meet for the purpose of discussing this motion? 
     
     
      
       If the Dail meets to-morrow, can we discuss this motion? 
     
     
      
       If the Dail meets to-morrow, Deputy O'Mara's motion will not be in order, because permission would be required to treat it as an urgent motion, and consent   would be required to take it without proper notice.  I told Deputy O'Mara yesterday that the motion was not handed in in time to be put down for Private Members' time to-morrow. Therefore, unless with the consent of the President, under the ordinary rules of the House Deputy O'Mara's motion could not come on to-morrow.  The motion was handed in in its present form yesterday evening.  I got an amendment this morning from Deputy Egan and another this afternoon from Deputy Heffernan.  But the motion of Deputy O'Mara will not be in order, from the point of view of time, to-morrow, and would not be in order until Wednesday next, if the Dail meets on that day.

     SCHOOL ATTENDANCE BILL, 1925.&mdash;FIFTH STAGE. 
     
        Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the School Attendance Bill, 1925, do now pass&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
   
   
     COURT OFFICERS BILL, 1926&mdash;SECOND STAGE. 
     
      
       This is a rather long and an important Bill, and it will be necessary for me to deal at some length with the provisions so that Deputies may have as clear a picture as I can convey of the system of court administration in the future.  It will be one of the last of the measures by which the administrative machinery of the courts is being built up.  When the Execution of Court Orders Bill, this Bill and a Jurors Bill are through, the administrative machinery of the courts will be complete.  This Bill deals mainly with the question of court staffs, from the Supreme Court down to the District Court.  There are, however, some other matters of considerable importance, relating to the administrative side of the courts, which are also dealt with, and I think it may be convenient, before moving to the question of court staffs proper, if I deal with some of these relatively extraneous matters. There are, for instance, covered by the Bill such matters as court fees, the question of the Fines and Fees Fund, the question of the District Probate Registries, summons servers, the abolition of the office of high sheriff, and the provision for the gradual disappearance, rather than the abolition, of the office of under-sheriff. 
     
     Dealing first with the question of court fees, which Deputies will find covered in Section 48, the proposal is that these should be fixed by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  That is, of course, a change.  The present position is that these fees are fixed by the rule-making authorities, that is, in practice by judges and professional men&mdash;solicitors and barristers.  I hold the view that the question of the extent to which litigants should pay for the cost to the State of administering justice, which   necessarily involves the extent to which that cost is to fall on the general taxpayer rather than on the litigants themselves, is not a judicial or a legal one, and it should lie with Executive Ministers, who will have to answer any complaints that may be made on the subject. 
     In fixing these fees, of course, the general principle on which we would propose to base our charges is that the administration of justice in civil matters should, as nearly as possible, pay for itself, but that in criminal matters the cost should be borne by the State. Once that principle is established the only difficulty is to apportion the fees accordingly, and that is really a matter for experienced officials rather than for judges or professional men.  The opinions, of course, of judges and of practising lawyers, whether barristers or solicitors, would be of value in a matter of the kind, but there would be no difficulty in practice in securing their opinions when the question of the final fixing of fees comes for review and decision.  That change, therefore, is definitely proposed by the Bill. 
     Sections 42 and 43 bear on the Fines and Fees Fund.  The present law on the matter is that in general all fines and District Court fees go into a fund called the Fines and Fees Fund, which is the primary source for the payment of the salaries of District Court clerks and the pensions of the retired Petty Sessions clerks.  It is not a sufficient source; it has to be supplemented by a Vote of the Dail.  The Fines and Fees Fund itself does not produce more than £25,000 per annum, whereas the salaries of the existing District Court clerks amount to about £30,000 per annum. Pensions of retired Petty Sessions clerks and retired headquarter officers amount to over £25,000, and salaries of existing headquarter staff, and considerable incidental expenses, bring the total cost of the District Court Clerks' Department, including all officers, past and present, to about £65,000.  This £65,000 does not include the District Court clerks in the Dublin Metropolitan area, who are paid out of voted monies.  The position, therefore, is that every year it is necessary to find approximately £40,000, over and above the income of the Fines and Fees Fund,   to meet the expenses of the District Court clerks and their Department.  In the past that additional annual sum had been obtained out of the annual yield of Dog Duty, but Dog Duty, as some Deputies will remember, has since the 1st January last become an Excise Duty, and the enactment under which it was formerly available to supplement the Fines and Fees Fund has been repealed, so that in future, if the Fines and Fees Fund were retained we should be in the position of having to look to the Dail to vote an annual sum of about £40,000 to supplement the Fines and Fees Fund. 
     Under the circumstances it has been decided to abolish this special fund altogether, to pay the fines and fees into the general Exchequer, and to ask the Dail to vote annually the necessary money for the pensions, salaries, and expenses of district court clerks, in the same way as the Dail votes the money for the pensions, salaries and expenses of the other court officers.  Perhaps I spoke rather loosely when I referred to the pensions, salaries and other expenses. What I mean is that the pensions of the petty sessions clerks are borne out of this Vote, and it is in that connection that I spoke of pensions. We propose to enact that in future all court fees and all fines shall go into the Exchequer direct instead of into a fund, and it will be observed that there is a provision for the making of orders under which certain classes of fines may be paid, not into the Exchequer, but in other directions to be specified in the order.  The reason for that is that at present under various statutes there are certain persons and bodies having a right to certain fines or portions of certain fines.  Local authorities, the Garda Siochana Reward Fund, and Fishery Conservators are just a few examples of that, and I have been informed that there is a regular entanglement, or network, of provisions of that kind which it would be impossible for any person to expound clearly. The law on this subject ought to be so simple and so clear that every district court clerk in the country might be expected to tell off the list of all the classes of fines in which vested interests of that kind exist. 
     
        It is not at all clear at this stage that all these various vested interests in fines, whatever their origin and however justified they may have been in their origin, are now justified at all. You have rights of that kind created by statute 50 or 60 years ago, but the circumstances have altered so much in the meantime that there seems no longer any justification for the private right.  Therefore, our object is, firstly, to clear up the existing confusion as to who is entitled to these rights, irrespective of the merits, and, secondly, to eliminate claims which have ceased to be justifiable in the existing circumstances or claims which are so insignificant in amount as not to deserve a separate existence.  Such vested interests as can be defended will be respected, but we want power to abolish and power to retain where retention seems desirable.  The elimination of certain claims, certain vested interests in fines of a particular kind, may sound a little as if it were confiscation, but Deputies will advert to the fact that in a great many cases, perhaps the majority of cases, the vested interests lie in some one Government department or another.  In most of these cases, therefore, it is simply a question of bookkeeping as between one branch of a department of State and another.  As it is, it simply means a lot of unnecessary administrative work. 
     In Section 47 Deputies will find the question of district probate registries dealt with.  Here again, it is rather an administrative discretion that is sought than a definite cast-iron provision.  We hold the view that it may be that these local probate registries are not necessary, and perhaps even are not justifiable. The position, at the moment, is that if a person domiciled anywhere in Saorstat Eireann dies, probate of the will.  if there is a will, or a grant of administration intestate if there is no will, can be had from the principal probate registry in Dublin. In addition, there are certain district probate registries.  There is, for instance, a district probate registry at Cork, Limerick, Tuam, Ballina, Waterford, Cavan, Kilkenny, and Mullingar. Each of these district probate registries has an area assigned to it, a definite territorial area.  If a   person domiciled in one of these areas dies then a grant may be extracted either in the local registry or in the principal registry in Dublin, according to the applicant's wish.  The proportions of the thing are that not quite one-half of the business is done direct with the central probate registry in Dublin. 
     The following are the proportions in which grants are issued from the district probate registries: Cork, about 1,200 a year; Limerick, about 1,000; Tuam, 800; Ballina, 800; Waterford, 700; Cavan, 650; Kilkenny, 450; and Mullingar, about 400, making a total of 6,000 as against about 5,000 issued annually from the central probate registry in Dublin.  There are some differences between the practice and procedure at the principal probate registry and the local registries.  For instance, the central registry in Dublin will not issue a grant unless the applicant, or his solicitor, attends in person at the registry.  It is obviously more satisfactory for a solicitor in Cork to attend at the registry there than to pay a town agent to attend the principal registry in Dublin.  District registrars are often prepared to do business by correspondence.  The personal attendance of the solicitor or his agent is not required.  In such a case, for instance, a Tralee solicitor could get a grant at the Cork or Limerick district registries without leaving his office and without employing an agent, whereas, if he applied to the principal registry he would have to come to Dublin or pay a solicitor to act in Dublin for him. 
     It may be true that the staffs in the district registries are prepared to do just a little more for customers, if I may use the word customer, than the staff in the principal registry in Dublin. The explanation of that may lie in the fact, and I think it is a fact, that their remuneration, to some extent at any rate, depends on the volume of business that passes through their particular registry.  I have been told, in cases where a paper might be returned by the principal registry in Dublin for one slight correction or another, that the staff in the local registries would be prepared to make the alteration themselves.  But apart from considerations of that kind, which are accidental and non-essential, the district probate   registry causes a certain amount of delay and confusion rather than speed and certainty.  Every application to the district registry has to come to the principal registry before it is passed and, of course, the reason for that is to ensure that there is not an application in the principal registry or a caveat against probate, with the result that the official work of indexing and calendaring is doubled in that way. 
     We are particularly anxious not to take any steps that would result in any serious inconvenience to litigants or solicitors in the country.  But you get the measure of the thing when you remember that there was, and is, I think, a local probate registry in Derry in which, prior to the Treaty and the establishment of the State, the county of Donegal was included.  Since the establishment of the State the probate work of Donegal has, of course, no longer been transacted in the district probate registry at Derry.  It has had to be transacted entirely with the principal probate registry in Dublin, and I have heard no suggestion from any quarter that that has caused inconvenience. It has never been represented to us, for instance, that Donegal, owing to the partition, ought to be assigned to some other local probate registry. 
     Therefore, what is sought in the Bill is not so much specific provision to close down these local registries but the permissive power to do so if, on examination and as a result of administrative experience, it is considered advisable. I do not put the thing higher than that.  I am not asking that the Dail should by statute abolish or close these local probate registries, but that we should have administrative power to close them if we are satisfied that that can be done without causing any real inconvenience to anybody, either to an ordinary citizen or a practising solicitor.  We come now to the question of summons servers under Section 38. At present there is a distinction between the manner in which the writs of the different courts may be served. High Court writs may be served by anybody, and Circuit Court processes are served by civil bill officers, who are paid about £20 per annum by the State   and who get fees in connection with each service.  District Court summonses are served by summons servers, and it is proposed to establish uniformity in the way in which summonses and writs of the various courts are served by establishing one single corps of summons servers. 
     
      
       Will they be armed? 
     
     
      
       No, we hope it will not be necessary.  One matter lying outside the general question of courts' staffs is the position of high sheriff and under-sheriff.  In an Act passed in 1920, the Sheriffs (Ireland) Act, the power of the high sheriff was reduced to two simple duties.  He had the duty of summoning grand juries and the duty of attending in a ceremonial way on the High Court Judge when going on Assize.  That was the position prior to the passing of our Courts of Justice Act.  Since the passing of our Act the duty of the high sheriff is to summon a grand jury which does not exist and to wait upon a judge who does not go out on Assize.  There is, in fact, no duty attaching to the office now.  Since the passing of the Courts of Justice Act it has simply been an empty title without any single duty attaching to it. Deputies, therefore, will not rise up in revolt at the proposal to abolish the office of high sheriff. 
     
     
      
       Are there no statutory obligations imposed on the sheriff? 
     
     
      
       None on the high sheriff.  He has no duties or powers. He has simply a title and we beg leave to withdraw it.  With regard to the under-sheriff, the position, of course, is different, and the proposal in the Bill is very different.  It is not proposed to abolish the office of the under-sheriff. It is not proposed to interfere in the slightest degree with any existing under-sheriff, but there is a strong opinion in my Department, shared by many practising solicitors with whom we have discussed the question, that it is possible to provide for the gradual disappearance of the under-sheriffs as such, and under the new system to   swing into the new office of county registrar the work of the under-sheriff as it at present exists.  The under-sheriff, as Deputies are aware, does not actually make seizures himself.  He supervises the work of the bailiffs and settles such technical and legal questions as may arise in connection with that work, questions, for instance, as the priority between this decree and that decree against the same person.  These questions are settled by the under-sheriff and there is need that the work of these officers, whether you call them by their old title of bailiffs or by their new title of court messengers, be supervised by a person with legal knowledge who can dispose of legal and technical questions that may arise. 
       We consider that that work can be adequately done by the county registrar and disposed of in his office, and we ask for power to make the arrangement that when an existing under-sheriff dies, resigns, or retires from office from any cause, the work may devolve upon the county registrar and may be disposed of in his office.  It is not, when Deputies reflect on it, a revolutionary proposal.  We believe that it is a sound administrative proposal. There is this further advantage; we believe that with the elimination of the under-sheriffs there will be room for the payment of some higher remuneration to the class of person engaged on the actual work of making seizures, and we would hope to be able to secure the services of some better type of men than those who performed that work in the past.  I believe that the supervision by the county registrar will be adequate and that legal and technical questions that may arise can be disposed of by him, and that it will not constitute an undue addition to the other work of his office.  I hold that the change is a sound administrative one. It has, at any rate, been closely discussed and considered by people competent to form a sound judgment on it, and our decision has been arrived at after consultation with such people. 
     
     
      
       Upon whom will devolve the work which the under-sheriff has hitherto carried out in connection with the conduct of Parliamentary   elections&mdash;will that job fall to the county registrar? 
     
     
      
       Perhaps not directly or personally, but it would be easy to arrange that a deputy would act for him as returning officer, while the actual responsibility might rest on the county registrar. 
     
     
      
       According to the section, all the rights and duties of the under-sheriff are to go to the county registrar. 
     
     
      
       Yes, but there may be delegation.  Section 45 provides, in connection with this change, that the under-sheriff may be relieved of one duty which at present attaches to him, and which he probably considers the most unpleasant, namely, the carrying out of the death sentence.  It is not considered necessary to carry into the new system the position which places the legal responsibility for seeing that the capital sentence was carried out on the under-sheriff of the county in which the offence occurred.  The governor of the prison in which the man is detained and from which he is brought to trial can bear that responsibility.  We see no reason for continuing to place that burden on the other officer.  That brings me to the question of courts staffs proper.  I have dealt up to the present with certain matters that were, perhaps, a little extraneous to the main object of the Bill, which is to define the position of the staffs of the courts under the new system.  We might start with the district courts staffs and work up to the hierarchy of the courts, the staffs of the Supreme Court. 
     
     The District Court is a comparatively simple matter, and the Bill proposes, merely, to give permanence to the existing temporary arrangements.  The position in Dublin and Cork is that there are regular District Court offices with a chief clerk and a staff working under him.  There are about ten such officers in Dublin, and, I think, three in the Cork office.  The Dublin office is one of old standing.  It is run on Civil Service lines.  It is staffed by open competitive examination and was not interfered with when the old petty sessions clerks were being disbanded   throughout the rest of the country. The remarks, therefore, which I have to make under the head of district court clerks do not refer to the Dublin office.  At Waterford there is a full-time clerk and assistant, but these two men are also responsible for some courts outside the city of Waterford. In no other place than Dublin, Cork, and Waterford does the staff in any one District Court consist of more than one man.  On the contrary, most of the District Court clerks serve the court at more than one place.  The volume of work of these clerks varies enormously, as Deputies know.  Some clerks are whole-time officers&mdash;and busy whole-time officers at that&mdash;working as many as seven or more courts.  There are other clerks with only one court, sitting monthly, and their whole yearly work, if brought together, would not take an efficient clerk a month to perform. The salary, like the work, naturally varies a great deal&mdash;from a maximum of £600, which is paid in one case only, in Dublin, inclusive of expenses and bonus, and corresponding roughly to an ordinary Civil Service salary of from £300 to £350, to a salary as small as £40 a year.  Excluding the staff in Dublin and one officer of the staff in Cork, all the other District Court clerks, to the number of a little over 160, were appointed since the establishment of the State.  They replaced the petty sessions clerks who were disbanded  en masse  in December, 1922. The petty sessions clerks, with the exception of possibly half a dozen, were not re-employed.  All the other appointees were new men.  The majority of them had been connected with the Dail Eireann Courts, or, if not with the Dail Eireann Courts, then with some other aspect of the movement which resulted in the establishment of the State.  When these men were appointed, the Civil Service Regulation Act was not in existence, and about 150 of them were appointed by me on my own responsibility, naturally, not without advice and not without suggestion.  I got very strong suggestions in some cases and some appointments were made contrary to suggestions which I received.  In the circumstances, these appointments were, of course, temporary. There was no permanency of   tenure and, of course, no question of pension rights.  I want the Dail just to consider for a moment that the running of the District Courts, with a staff entirely untrained and recruited in that way and in those circumstances, was not an easy proposition for the District Justices or for my own Department; on the whole these men may be said to have justified their selection.  There have been about a dozen dismissals and, perhaps, from a dozen to a score more are in the last stages of probation.  We are hoping against hope that with patience on the side of the Department and a considerable effort on the side of the clerks themselves, they may be brought over the border line of efficiency which, at present, they have not touched.  It has been necessary to nurse certain weaklings amongst the flock in that way, and to exercise a patience that is not usual in the public service, that should not be usual in the public service, and that is only justified by the special circumstances and the conditions which led to the appointment of those men. 
     
      
       Would the Minister say how he has helped the lazy ones on? 
     
     
      
       He has helped them off. 
     
     
      
       There have been, as I say, a dozen dismissals.  I do not want Deputies to draw the conclusion that there has been any general failure on the part of the District Court clerks, because the position is rather the contrary. The great majority of them fitted into their new positions and duties and responsibilities with really extraordinary rapidity.  Their work is somewhat technical.  It takes a degree of intelligence to master it and the majority have mastered it quite well. The position, for some time past, is that vacancies, arising in these District Court clerkships, have been filled by arrangement with the Civil Service Commissioners.  The vacancy is advertised. It is a great relief to me to have the positions filled in that way. All applicants are put through a qualifying examination and, from those who qualify, the Civil Service Commissioners, with the advice of the Selection Board, pick out the most suitable men.   The present Bill makes no change in that system.  There are about 150 of those clerks and the average salary is £200 per annum inclusive. 
       Because I feel it in my bones that much will be said on the question of the desirability of making those men permanent and pensionable, it may be well to say a word about it now.  The Bill does not do that.  On the other hand, the Bill does not preclude the possibility of whole-time clerks being established and becoming, in that way, pensionable.  It is a very difficult patchwork kind of position and I think that the Deputy who simply says, in an offhand way, that it is desirable to make District Court clerks pensionable, is not envisaging the position as it exists.  The great majority of those men are part-time officers who have really very little work to do.  They have, perhaps, a court a month, or possibly even a court a fortnight, and it begins and ends at that.  The suggestion that pensions should be forthcoming for men who are employed on those terms is contrary to sound administrative principles, as recognised for many a long day in the Civil Service&mdash;the principle that only full-time officers should be pensionable.  I shall, no doubt, have to deal with amendments on the Committee Stage, and the matter can be more fully discussed, but I want to throw out the warning now to Deputies that they ought not to be stampeded by the view that there is a strong direct case for making District Court clerks pensionable officers.  There may be a sound case for making certain District Court clerks established officers.  That is quite another matter. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister mean whole-time district court clerks? 
     
     
      
       Yes.  At any rate, that possibility is not precluded by the Bill.  The Bill rather leaves the matter at large, and that is the way I should wish to leave it. 
     
     Passing from the district court to the circuit court, the circuit court is being run at present, and has been run since its establishment, by the old county court machinery; in other words, by   the clerk of the Crown and Peace. There are twenty-seven clerks of the Crown and Peace&mdash;one for each of the twenty-six counties, except Cork, which has two, as Cork was formerly divided for county purposes into two parts, the West Riding and East Riding, the latter including the city of Cork.  These officers were assisted in two ways. There was an officer called the registrar to the civil bill court, who was expected to do some of the work which would otherwise have fallen on the clerk of the Crown and Peace, and the clerk of the Crown and Peace received from the State an allowance towards the cost of clerical assistance in his office.  The registrar to the civil bill court was appointed by the county court judge and was not infrequently a friend or relative of that judge.  His duties were never very well defined.  Some judges and some clerks of the Crown and Peace expected the registrar to do work, and some registrars did work. But that was the exception rather than the rule.  I am not trying to overpaint the picture or simply to exaggerate for the sake of discrediting the system that has gone.  I am trying to state the facts, so that Deputies may realise what the position was.  The remuneration of the registrar was not very high, but it was, perhaps, high in proportion to the work done.  It was two guineas per day.  The registrar went out of office on the death or resignation of the judge to whom he was attached.  He had no pensionable rights.  The Judiciary Committee, on whose report our present court system is founded, recommended the abolition of the office of registrar to the civil bill court, and it is proposed in the present Bill to amalgamate the duties of that office with those of the new office of county registrar. 
     As regards the second kind of assistance which the clerk of the Crown and Peace had in the discharge of his duty, it was a money allowance towards the cost of his staff.  This allowance varied from £1,100 per annum downwards and it varied a great deal between one county and another.  In addition to running the County Courts office, the clerk of the Crown and Peace acted also as registration officer in connection with the lists of parliamentary and local   government voters, the compilation of the jurors' lists and the jurors' book, and he was the local registration of title officer under the Local Registration of Title Act, 1891.  The clerk of the Crown and Peace was appointed by the Lord Lieutenant, and might be removed by the Lord Chancellor for misconduct or incapacity.  If not removed, he remained in office until he died or voluntarily resigned.  The statutory qualification was that he should be a solicitor of six years' standing.  The emoluments of a clerk of the Crown and Peace were made up partly of salary and partly of fees.  He received a salary as clerk of the Crown and Peace, a separate salary as registration officer, fees for compiling the franchise lists and a third salary as local registrar of title.  Latterly he received cost of living bonus on these salaries.  The amount of the bonus was, in most cases, relatively small, as it is in the case of all the larger Civil Service salaries. The salaries varied very much as between the smallest and the biggest county and so did the fees.  The fees also varied a good deal as between county and county.  It is difficult to give exact figures in connection with fees received by the clerks of the Crown and Peace, but I am probably right in saying that the worst paid clerk of the Crown and Peace had a net income of over £1,000, and at least three of the best paid clerks had a gross income of over £2,000.  There is one clerk whose income probably exceded £2,300.  It is proposed to substitute for the clerk of the Crown and Peace a new officer to be called the county registrar, who will do, for a fixed salary, all the work of the old officer and any other work which may, from time to time, be thrown on him.  He will be appointed and, if necessary, removed by the Executive Council.  He will automatically vacate office at the age of 65 years, but power is sought by the Bill to extend service, in individual cases, to a maximum of 68 years.  Permissive elasticity, to the extent of three years, is asked for under the Bill.  That can be discussed later.  The salaries will, like all Civil Service salaries, be fixed by the head of the Department&mdash;that is, in the present case, by the Minister for Justice&mdash;with   the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  The salaries which we contemplate paying in the regular way will vary.  At the present cost of living, they will be from about £900 inclusive to £1,200 inclusive, according to the size of the county.  But in the case of an existing clerk of the Crown and Peace, who is offered and who accepts re-employment as county registrar, we will not, in general, reduce the existing salary.  I say &ldquo;in general&rdquo; because some of their salaries are so high that we would not be prepared to allow them to stand.  The figure I have in mind as a maximum is £1,200 per annum, plus bonus.  That, at the present rate, would be about £1,450, which would be the highest salary which we would pay to any county registrar, even as an inducement to a clerk of the Crown and Peace to continue on in our service under the new system. 
     
      
       took the Chair. 
     
     
      
       It will be clear to Deputies, therefore, that I have in mind two sums, a maximum of £1,200 inclusive, as the ordinary salary to be paid to the county registrar, and a maximum of £1,200, plus bonus, which, at the present rate, would amount to £1,450 to an existing clerk of the Crown and Peace who would wish to remain on and serve under the new system.  The county registrar will surrender to the Exchequer all fees which represent additional emolument to himself or to his staff.  On the other hand we will relieve the county registrar of all financial responsibility as regards the staff. 
     
     As regards existing employees of clerks of the Crown and Peace, these men are part, and the most serious part, of the problem of the temporary staff in court offices.  Many of them have given long and faithful service.  Many of them have had a great deal of heavy work to do, and their claim to be established and to be given pensionable rights is difficult to resist.  Frequently men employed in that way in technical temporary capacities in the offices of the clerks of the Crown and Peace have done rather heavy clerical work at a very low rate of remuneration.  So as   to avoid raising any excessive hopes I would like to say that pensionable rights are very rarely given retrospectively, and that the Minister for Finance would not contemplate embarking on such a course at this particular time, and in our present condition. Men similarly situated in England have recently been admitted to the pensionable service.  However, they have not been admitted retrospectively or, if there was retrospection it was only to the extent of one or two years. A date is mentioned in this Bill&mdash;1st January, 1924&mdash;as the earliest possible date from which pensionable service was to take effect.  That is the furthest we would be prepared to allow if the men were placed on a pensionable basis.  That finishes consideration of the staff of the circuit courts. 
     
      
       The registrar is to take over the duties of the sub-sheriff and under sub-section (2) of Section 34 he is really made a sort of judge in certain cases.  Is that the intention? 
     
     
      
       Perhaps that is more a matter for Committee Stage. These functions under sub-section (2) of Section 34 are minor and ancillary functions.  If I devoted more time to it I could show the Deputy that it is not a very substantial jurisdiction.  It is simply in minor matters that might properly be disposed of in that way. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister say at this stage what is the position of the recent temporary appointments of stenographers?  Does the Bill affect their position? 
     
     
      
       In the form in which the Deputy puts it the answer is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  Section 37 has a bearing on the general staff of the Circuit Courts. It reads:&mdash; 
     
     There shall be employed, in every Circuit Court office established under this Act such and so many officers, clerks, messengers, and servants as the Minister shall, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, from time to time determine, and all such officers, clerks, messengers, and servants shall hold office on such terms and conditions as the Minister for Finance shall prescribe and shall be   paid out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas such salaries as the Minister shall, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, direct. 
     That is about as much as there is in the Bill bearing on that point.  Coming to the High Court staff, I would like it to be understood that what I have to say in this connection I confine to the permanent or pensionable staff.  There are in the High Court a considerable number of temporary employees, to some of whom the remarks I have made in connection with the staffs in the offices of the Clerks of the Crown and Peace apply equally.  In fact at the time of the change of Government I find that the British Treasury was on the point of establishing some members of the staff attached to the office of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy and in the High Courts. 
     As regards the permanent staff, the position, broadly, is that almost all the existing officers are not, strictly speaking, officers of our High Court of Justice at all.  They are officers appointed definitely on the definite tenure of the Supreme Court of Judicature which was abolished by our Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  However, there was a section in the Courts of Justice Act, Section 102, which provided that all registrars, clerks and other officers attached to the then Supreme Court of Judicature or to the Lord Chief Justice were to continue to hold office by the same tenure as heretofore and to discharge the duties heretofore discharged by them, or duties analogous thereto, unless and until otherwise determined by the Oireachtas.  That arrangement, while obviously open to objection, was an arrangement not intended to last for a considerable length of time, and has worked well in practice during the 18 months that have passed since the abolition of the old Supreme Court. Naturally, it is not a position that can go on indefinitely, and the officers themselves will be anxious to know where they stand and what their position is to be definitely under the new system.  There was a peculiarity with regard to the removal of some of these officers.  They could only be removed for stated reasons with the consent of the Lord Chancellor.  There was no   age limit.  Some of the existing officers are over 65, some considerably over that age.  That is not a state of affairs we are anxious to see continued in the public service. 
     It must be remembered that the present staff of the High Courts is a survival of the time when every judge of the Supreme Court was for every purpose a court to himself.  The courts were run in water-tight compartments, and the officers were appointed for certain definite purposes, and in connection with certain definite courts only. There was no flexibility or interchangeability in the matter of staff.  Again, I think the present staff is admittedly extravagant.  At the moment it is not in the total so extravagant as it was some years ago, because, if we have not been able to do anything else, we have at least been able to control new appointments and promotions, but, even as it is, there are about twelve posts the holders of which draw £1,000 or over a year, plus bonus.  Again, the staffing was based on the idea that every post which was worth having was to be at the giving of the judge, and while there have been several gratifying exceptions to the rule, the position really was that any post worth £500 a year or over it, and sometimes even lesser posts, were filled when they became vacant by judicial patronage, and very often by the appointment of a son, nephew or close relative or friend of the judge in whom the power of appointment was vested.  There, again, I am not endeavouring simply in any spirit of condemnation to draw a caricature, but I am anxious to state the facts, and these are notoriously the facts with regard to the staffing of the High Court in the past. 
     
      
       Would the Minister say whether the new officers who are to be appointed by the Executive Council are to be appointed by means of the Civil Service Commission? 
     
     
      
       Yes, by the Civil Service Commission, with some exceptions. There will be the master of the central court office, and taxing masters. These offices will be filled by the Executive Council.  They will not be filled in the ordinary way by Civil Service   promotion, but by persons brought in from outside. 
     
     
      
       Such offices as these would be the counterpart of the patronage by judges in the past.  It was the patronage of the judges in the past, and now it is the patronage of the Executive Council. 
     
     
      
       It is considered not only desirable but necessary to make a change in that system of judicial patronage.  Sometimes patronage is necessary.  The aim here has been to reduce the patronage to the irreducible minimum, but it will be agreed where it is to be exercised it should be responsible patronage, it should be a patronage exercised by people who have responsibility, who are subject to criticism, and who can be called upon to answer for their deeds or misdeeds in the matter of the exercise of their patronage.  Out of all the posts in the new High Court we see only two which must necessarily be filled by the appointment of persons from outside the court staff proper.  These are the posts of master and taxing master, and even in these two cases it might from time to time be found possible to promote a member of the ordinary court staff, but we thought it better to draw the line firmly and definitely and to say the master and the taxing master shall be appointed from outside from the profession of barrister or solicitor respectively, and in no other case shall anyone be brought in from outside over the heads of the regular staff.  I think that is the proper administrative position. We are confirmed in that view by a report passed over to us which was made by the British Treasury experts in 1921 on the staffing of the High Court.  I quoted from it here on one occasion, and the censures it contained on the High Court staff were very stringent indeed. 
     
     It is hardly necessary to point out that the Bill gives to the ordinary officer of the court a clear line of promotion which he never had before, and we consider that that important prospect will more than compensate for the inevitable reduction in the number and in the value of the higher posts.   There will, of course, be such a reduction. Again, we have decided that the staff of the High Court shall be employed on the same conditions and terms as any other department in the State.  There is no reason, so far as we can see, why a clerk of the High Court, who enters by open competition and receives a salary from the State, should have any privileges over and above those common to the Civil Service generally. There is certainly no reason why he should remain in office indefinitely, irrespective of age or efficiency, and there is no reason why he should not do a full day's work if it is there for him to do.  At present he cannot be obliged to work before the hour of 10.30 a.m. or after 4 p.m.  On Saturday the working hours are from 10.30 to 12 o'clock&mdash;that is, he works approximately 30 hours a week except during the long vacation, when he does not work at all. 
     
      
       Will the Minister say whether these officers will be transferable to any other department of State. 
     
     
      
       Existing officers will not. 
     
     
      
       I mean will any officers appointed to the courts under this Bill be interchangeable with other departments of State, or will they be strictly secured to the court service? 
     
     
      
       The fact is that, theoretically, leaving out of consideration the existing staff, and dealing with men simply recruited in the future, they would be part of the Civil Service of the State, and technically it might be that they could be transferred from the department of the court to another department.  I think in practice the courts would tend to remain a separate and water-tight branch of the Civil Service.  I suggest that during the long vacation there was, in fact, no work, and that is a matter of three months.  When you contrast that with the position of the ordinary civil servant it will be seen that there is a very considerable difference.  The ordinary civil servant works a minimum of 41 hours a week for eleven months in the year, as against 30 hours in the week for nine months in the year in the case   of the courts.  But apart from the question of tenure, salary and the hours of the individual clerk, it is proposed to reconstruct the High Court offices on the principle of creating by statute as few separae offices as possible.  Certain offices must so clearly have separate existence, and must so necessarily be referred to by name in the Rules of Court, that we have given them names of separate statutory origin.  The offices in question are the master's office, the taxing master's office, the office of accounts and inquiries, the probate office, the bankruptcy office, and the accountant's office. 
       There are six statutory offices given a separate existence, and a separate name by the Bill.  Every one of these six has a clear-cut and homogeneous mass of work to do.  Everything else that is required to be done, from the issuing of the initiating writ to the marking of the judgment will be done in the only other office we propose to create, and which might be called the residuary office, namely, the central office.  To anyone who is at all familiar with high court procedure, the names of these offices will, of course, explain themselves, and a section will be found in the Bill dealing with each office, and prescribing the work that will be performed in each set of offices.  Deputies who are not familiar with legal procedure will probably agree that a detailed description of the technical duties of each office is scarcely possible or desirable at this stage of the Bill. 
       Probate and bankruptcy procedure are probably self-explanatory.  The Taxing Office is, of course, the office where the costs which are to be allowed are settled and the persons who perform that particular work must necessarily be persons who have had a good practice and a good standing as solicitors. No other men can really be expected to know the intricacies of cost-drawing or to have the necessary experience and authority to tell a fellow-solicitor, if and when it is necessary, that his costs are excessive and must be reduced.  I may say that there are at present three taxing masters.  That was the taxing staff for the whole of Ireland in the past, and two will probably, almost certainly, suffice for the area of the Free State in future. 
     
     
        The Accounts and Inquiries Office is a new name.  It represents merely the amalgamation of the two existing offices of the two chief clerks in Chancery and also the rather small volume of business of the same character remaining in the old Land Judges' office. The object of this particular office is simple enough.  Speaking broadly, the business that comes before the High Court might be divided into two main branches.  A.B. claims that C.D. owes him a certain sum on a contract, for damages arising out of an accident, or for injury to reputation by slander. The questions to be resolved by the court are really only two.  One question would be: Is the claim good at all; is it sound, and, if so, what is the amount to be assessed?  In that class of case there is a short trial of the issue and the matter ends.  Then there is a different class of business.  A.B. asks the Court to control, investigate and clear up a complicated set of transactions, such as the winding-up of a company or the administration of a deceased person's property.  Inquiries have to be made; advertisements have to be inserted; creditors' claims have to be examined; debtors have to be followed up and assets realised.  The matter might take six years to clear up and difficult points of law might crop up from time to time in the process.  It is that kind of case which the Accounts and Inquiries Office will deal with under the new system.  The Accountant's Office is the office which takes charge of the securities and moneys which are lodged with the court, and it is the office which makes payments as ordered by the court. 
     Lastly, there is the office of the master, the most important office of the High Court system.  It is proposed to give the master a dual capacity.  He will, to a certain limited extent, be a kind of minor judge who will save the time of the High Court and the parties by deciding matters which, while too important to be dealt with by officials pure and simple, are yet of a more or less routine nature and do not call for a special sitting of the High Court. There will, of course, be an appeal from any such decision of the master.  He will in no matter, however unimportant,   be the final authority.  That is one capacity of the master&mdash;the quasi-judicial capacity.  On the administrative side the Master will be the administrative head of the Central Office. 
     
      
       Where is the Central Office to be situated?  The Bill does not state here where it will be situated. 
     
     
      
       The Bill, of course, does not touch, in connection with any office, the question of its location, but it will be&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       In Dublin. 
     
     
      
       It will be, of course, in Dublin and will be convenient to the courts. 
     
     
      
       It is your view that it should be in Dublin, but there is nothing to prevent a proposal that it should be in Cork or Limerick. 
     
     
      
       Nothing except our horse-sense.  I was speaking of the dual capacity of the master of the Central Office.  He will have certain minor, quasi-judicial functions and he will also have very considerable administrative responsibility.  As the head and the over-riding authority in the Central Office, subject only to the Minister, he will be the authority on matters of staff and establishment in every High Court office.  Through that officer we would look to establish a certain uniformity of procedure and outlook in the separate offices in the courts.  He will be there to see that the work goes on smoothly and diligently and that a good general tone, a business-like and industrious atmosphere and a general harmony in methods, exist throughout the system.  If there are suggestions that the clerks in any one office are notoriously having an easier time than the clerks in other offices, it will be his duty to remove any inequalities of that kind and to deal generally with the question of the proper apportionment of the staff and the proper assignment of work amongst the staff.  If there are complaints from the public, complaints of inconvenience or discourtesy in connection with the business of the courts, it would be for the   master of the Central Office to inquire into such complaints, to investigate them and, if possible, to deal with them himself.  If they are of sufficient proportions to require it, he will report to the Minister for Justice on any such matters. 
     
     
      
       What salary is it contemplated this Master of everything shall have? 
     
     
      
       It is not fixed by the Bill, and no decision has been come to. 
     
     
      
       He deserves a good salary. 
     
     
      
       No doubt it will be said in criticism that we are putting two entirely different duties, two very dissimilar duties, on the same man. First, we are asking him to perform, to some extent at any rate, the duties of a judge, and then we are looking to him to perform the duties of an administrative officer.  That is quite true and we recognise it fully.  It could be defended, if we wish to take that line of defence, by a precedent.  The Master of the King's Bench in the past and the judges themselves had, to some extent, that dual position.  There is, however, another, and a better defence, and it is that the semi-judicial duties of the Master will not, it is anticipated, occupy him for more than two hours a day, and we cannot, at the very time that we are abandoning one system largely because of its wastefulness, and largely because of its cost, allow under the now system such an anomaly as that of the highest paid officer in the court going home every day at lunch-time because there is nothing more for him to do.  Consequently, we have taken steps to see that there will be something for him to do after lunch. 
     
     There is another consideration.  No officer, except this officer, could properly be put into a position where he might be called upon to censure any principal officer in the court or any particular officer amongst the courts staff.  Thirdly, we are following in this matter the recommendations of the Judiciary Committee's report, which   Deputies, will remember, was an unanimous report from men who, certainly, ought to be able to form a sound judgment upon matters of that kind. 
     We pass now to the Supreme Court&mdash; the court of appeal.  Staffing, so far as that court is concerned, is a very simple matter.  It is eminently a court in which practically all the work is done by the judges themselves.  It requires simply an officer of some standing to act as its registrar, and provision is made for that in the Bill.  It will need very little other staff.  The same officer who will act as registrar to the Supreme Court, as such, will act as registrar to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Lastly we come to the staff, which the Chief Justice will require, in the exercise of jurisdiction transferred to him by Section 19 of the Courts of Justice Act of 1924.  That jurisdiction may be described as, firstly, the wardship of lunatics; secondly, the wardship of minors; thirdly, the appointment and disciplinary control of solicitors, and, fourthly, the appointment of commissioners for oaths.  At present, for the purposes of the first of those&mdash;the wardship of lunatics&mdash;there is a separate office, and, also, there is a separate office for number two, the wardship of minors.  Each of these&mdash;one and two, lunatics and minors, represent a steady flow of work.  As regards the other items&mdash;disciplinary control of solicitors and appointment of commissioners for oaths, the work is, of course, not heavy. It is done at present under what used to be the Crown and Hanaper Office, one or two fairly junior officials doing all of it except what falls to the personal discretion and authority of the Chief Justice himself. 
     We have decided to create a new officer, to be known as the Registrar to the Chief Justice, in whose office all four classes of work will be done; that is, the work falling under each of the four heads to which I refer will be done in the office of this new official, who will be known as Registrar to the Chief Justice. 
     Now, before I conclude, I would like to say a few general words as to the position of the existing officials, in the High Court, and the Supreme Court,   under the provisions and operation of this Bill.  There is no question at all as to what the legal position will be.  All the former High Court officers under this Bill will be legally, and technically, discharged from office within the meaning of Article 10 of the Treaty as soon as Part I. of this Bill comes into operation. That is, as I say, the legal and technical position, and nothing that we can do or say can prevent every one of those officers becoming entitled to the compensation which Article 10 of the Treaty guarantees.  That is the legal aspect.  These officers are discharged, and their right to compensation accrues automatically.  Now, in contrast to that legal and technical position, I would like to speak of the actual position. The actual position is, that it is not desired to discharge from office a single one of these men, save those who are over the retiring age, which it is proposed to fix by the Bill, or who are otherwise unfit for their work.  And with these exceptions we offer to every one of those officers re-employment under the new system and we guarantee that their salaries will not be reduced even where we think, as we do think in certain cases, that they are too high. 
     We think, however, that they are not entitled to have it both ways and we ask them to face the alternative.  Either they are discharged in the sense of going out and staying out or they are not. We will not re-employ any man who insists on his discharge in the full sense and applies for compensation.  Accordingly, if any of those officers wish to take the view that they are discharged, that their office has been abolished, and that they are entitled to compensation under Article 10, that is something that we can not prevent, but we will not re-employ such officers.  An officer who takes that stand must simply go and take his compensation.  If we re-employ any man he must waive his compensation rights altogether so far as they arise out of his technical discharge&mdash;a technical discharge which is undoubtedly there once we pass this Bill and once Part 1 of this Bill is brought into operation.  We have gone to the length of saying in this Bill for the assurance of the timid that if any man accepts   re-employment under these conditions and is subsequently discharged, not through his own fault, his claim for compensation shall thereupon revive. If any official is unwilling to accept these terms, if he will not accept re-employment with these guarantees in lieu of compensation, then we do not want him, and whatever temporary inconvenience may arise we will get on without him.  But if I may venture to do it I would like to offer a word of advice to the younger men particularly, those who, perhaps, feel that in the past, for one reason or another or for many reasons, they have not had a square deal&mdash;men to whom is now thrown open the whole avenue of promotion, and I would say to them that they should think twice, and many times, before they decide to become pensioners rather than serve their own Government on a guarantee such as no other class of civil servants ever had. There may be exceptional cases.  There may be men amongst the court staff, as there have been men in other branches of the public service, who are genuinely determined not to serve an Irish Government, but for the ordinary Irishmen in the courts I do not hesitate to say that retirement in the existing circumstances would not merely be an unwise course from his own individual point of view but would be an unpatriotic course. 
     I have reason to believe that the views that I have expressed are, in fact, held by the great body of court officers themselves.  I feel that I can reassure Deputies who might fear that one result of this Bill and of the establishment of the new system which the Bill envisages would be any large exodus from the public service under Article 10 of the Treaty.  I do not believe there will be any such result.  I do not believe it is the tendency or disposition amongst court officers to take that course.  That concludes the survey which I wished to make of the court staffs, commencing at the District Court and going up through the ranks, to the higher officers. 
     There is one word I would like to say on the Bill generally.  At this stage we are considering it in outline and in   principle.  There will be probably an interval of some length between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage, and it may be that I myself may have to bring forward, or have brought forward many official amendments.  For one thing the exigencies of Parliamentary time made it necessary for me to bring in the Bill rather abruptly as soon as I was in a position to get it from the draftsman.  I was anxious to have the Bill before the Dail, because until this Bill is law the rules of court cannot be brought before the Dail and the Seanad.  All that led to this position, which I would like just to comment briefly on&mdash;that the judges did not get an opportunity which I would have wished to give them to consider this Bill.  The Bill was only for a very short time in the hands of the Chief Justice before it was printed for publication and for Deputies.  It is at present being considered by the judges and it may be that suggestions and recommendations may come along from that source which, on examination, it would seem wise to adopt.  In that event I would, of course, bring forward official amendments for the Committee Stage, but in broad outline and in principle I put the Bill for the consideration of the Deputies and I move its Second Reading. 
     
      
       I have no doubt whatever that the Bill will make for greater efficiency of the bureaucratic kind in the working of the mechanical arrangements&mdash;the ordinary office work of the law courts.  I can quite imagine that much is needed in that direction and that this will make for such a beneficent change, but I am not at all convinced that the policy which the Ministry is pursuing in respect to this Bill and in respect to the whole court procedure, has been thoroughly ventilated and justified by the Minister.  I am not dogmatic on the subject, because I am in doubt, but I want to point out what I think is being accomplished &mdash;that is, a very radical change in the relations between the Executive, the political institutions and the judicial institutions of the country.  This is only a later exhibition of the change that is being accomplished, and it does   not seem to me to have been recognised by the country or the Dail or to have been justified yet by argument.  It may be justifiable; I have no doubt that very many grievances, very many anomalies, probably very many inequalities, existed under the old system, but whether we are adopting the only means that is at hand to bring these things to right or not, I am not at all certain. What we are doing under this Bill, as under several other Bills, is to bring the judiciary more and more into relationship with and under the direction of the political institutions.  It may be justifiable; it may be explainable; it may be the right thing to do, but it has not yet been justified by argument as a matter of anything more than mere practical convenience. 
       It is very generally known, and usually pointed out with pride, that the judicial system which we have taken over is supposed to be entirely independent and distinct from the Executive authority and free from any influence by that authority.  It is that which is desired to be continued by everyone who speaks.  But as a consequence of the intention to keep the judiciary independent of the political Executive and the Legislature once they are appointed, part of the plan was undoubtedly to keep to the judiciary themselves the control of the machine of which they are the head. That is to say, the whole of the machinery for administering and interpreting the law, the administration of justice as between litigants, was supposed to be under the direction of the judiciary, and while undoubtedly they came eventually to be paid out of the Executive funds, in many cases they were still an autonomous portion of the Governmental institutions of the country. 
     
     I think we are entitled to have the case argued on the principle apart from the practical questions involved in this Bill&mdash;that is to say, whether it is justifiable that the appointment of the higher officers particularly, of the courts, should be at the discretion of the political executive for the time or whether power of that kind should not be retained with some modification perhaps, still in the hands of the judiciary.   I say that that is the principle involved here and that that is the principle that should be argued and which we should be convinced of before we consent finally to the passing of this Bill with all that is involved in it. 
     As I said at the beginning, I am not raising any definite opposition to the proposition.  I am only querying the wisdom of it and asserting that the case for that change has not been made. I think the Dail has not been aware of the very big issue that is being decided in these various Bills dealing with the courts.  The Minister will not mind my referring to a Bill that has been recently passed and that we have agreed to in the circumstances.  I am speaking of the Land Bill.  It is another illustration indicating the state of mind on the part of the Executive Council in regard to this question.  Then I have had in mind since December a statement of the Minister himself which also, I think, throws a little light on his attitude of mind on these matters.  In the course of the discussion on the Courts of Justice Bill, in Committee, I raised a question as to the proposition that the Chief Justice should have a final say in the appointment of which judge should try a particular case, and while a good argument, no doubt, was used by the Minister in justification of this it was agreed that with the position that had hitherto been adopted of allocating judges to certain cases by some sort of rote, there must be a final decider when any question arose. 
     I put the hypothetical case that a political issue might be raised in a court and a particular judge might be appointed to try that case.  I made an interjection: 
     &ldquo;Did the Minister ever hear of Peter the Packer?&rdquo; 
     And the Minister replied: 
     &ldquo;Yes, but there was not responsible government in the country then, and there were not two Houses of Parliament before which matters of that kind could be raised.&rdquo; 
     A little further on he said: 
     &ldquo;... the suggestion that judges will be selected to do particular work with an eye to the probable result if   it is done by this judge, rather than by that judge.  That suggestion goes to the very root of the whole judicial system and to the root of your whole confidence in the administration of the law, and, I think, it cannot be met.  If one were to attempt to meet it, it would really mean that one had not confidence in the judges appointed by the Executive and in the desire of judges to be impartial between indicted persons and the State.&rdquo; 
     This is the point I want to direct the attention of the Dail to: 
     &ldquo;I can only suggest, if and when cases of that kind arise, Deputy Johnson, or his successor in the leadership of the Opposition of the future, would merely have to put down a motion and raise the whole question.&rdquo; 
     Of course that is quite contrary to the constitutional provision of Article 68 which lays it down that no judge can be removed except for stated misbehaviour and incapacity, and then only by special resolution.  It is a constitutional understanding&mdash;I think it is laid down, as a matter of fact&mdash;certainly the Ceann Comhairle would not allow any question relating to the conduct of a judge to be raised in the Dail except there was a formal motion intended to bring about that judge's removal from office, and it would have to be a very seriously propounded statement indicating misbehaviour and incapacity. 
     
      
       Hear, hear. 
     
     
      
       I am drawing attention to this because it seems to me to indicate that the Minister is thinking too much of the possible control by the Executive and by the Dail of the judges. and I think this Bill is a further indication of the state of mind which is allowing the judiciary and the judicial system to be brought into contact with and under the direction of the Executive, or in this case, of the Dail.  It is probably true&mdash;I have no doubt it is true, because it has been stated by so many people with authority to speak&mdash; that the patronage that has been exercised in the past by judges has been   very often a personal patronage, and not one which has been exercised with proper regard to the requirements of the highest function, perhaps, in the State.  Whether the remedy for that is to hand over the patronage or the appointments to the political executive&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       What patronage? 
     
     
      
       Patronage in the case of the two chief officers, which the Minister himself said would be appointed by the Executive Council&mdash;the master of the High Court and the taxing master.  The other officers are to be appointed&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       By the Minister. 
     
     
      
       Yes, by the Minister, by means of the Civil Service Commission, although I do not think it is laid down. 
     
     
      
       Who should appoint the judges theoretically in the Deputy's Utopia? 
     
     
      
       I am not talking about Utopia; I am talking about things which&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Who, in fact, have appointed them? 
     
     
      
       The Executive Council. I am not making any point of that, or finding any fault with it, but I say that the difference that is being made is that the patronage that was exercised by the judges in the past is now to be exercised by the Minister. 
     
     
      
       In respect of three officers. 
     
     
      
       Yes, in respect of three officers.  I have no doubt that in the ordinary course of affairs the offices will be filled better if the system of Civil Service appointments was followed, but I am just wondering whether it would not have been possible to retain the autonomy of the judiciary &mdash;that is, in the control of the staffs after their appointment by this means, which has now been adopted in the Civil Service generally, and secure immunity from the possibility of suspicion that political influence may be exercised   through the courts.  The fact that these officers are to be civil servants brings them again into the category of removable officers, interchangeable officers, directly under the control of the political executive of the time.  As I said at the beginning, it is possible that this may be a justifiable position.  I am not affirming any positive views on that matter. 
     
     
      
       It sounds very like it. 
     
     
      
       It may be justifiable, it may be arguable, but it has not been justified as a matter of principle, that it is desirable to change the system of having the judiciary-an autonomous institution, having control of the staffs of the judiciary, by bringing the staffs under the control of the political executive. It is a very grave question and I think should have been argued or justified as a matter of definite departure from a course of practice that is old-established and very highly thought of. 
       There is another point which has a little reference to the question I am raising.  The question was raised by Deputy Corish as to the position of the under-sheriffs as the responsible officers with respect to Parliamentary elections.  I think it would be true to say that the reason why they were appointed in the past was because of their detachment from the political authority of any Minister.  I think I am right in saying that. 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       Historically.  I think if that is to be changed the undersheriff is not the right person in the future to undertake the work of conducting Parliamentary elections.  That has always seemed to be a little foreign to the duties of a sheriff, and I think in many cases they have not been very conversant with these duties.  If we are going to make a change, if we are going to bring all these officers into the Civil Service, I suggest that it would be better that the conduct of Dail and Seanad elections should be under the responsibility either of the Department of Local Government or of some department of the Minister for Justice, actually   an administrative officer conversant with general local government affairs.  I throw out that, because I think that the sheriffs have not been the most happy selection for responsible authority over Parliamentary elections. 
       I have been hoping that when the Rules of Court were to come before us we would see some evidence of the Minister's desire to make law cheap, and, as I would hope also, to make some provision for the poor litigant.  There is nothing in the Bill which suggests to me that that has been in the mind of the Minister or his advisers, and I am sorry that it has not been thought desirable to make provision for the appointment of some officer of the courts who could be approached by the poor litigant for advice and assistance where it is clear that the costs of litigation are entirely beyond the capacity of the poor person.  Such things have been done in other countries, and I was hopeful that we might have found a way of doing it when revising the system through the Rules of Court and through the Court Officers Bill.  I do not know whether the Minister can tell us if he has thought of this proposal, which, I think, was made earlier, but if he has not done so, and if it is still possible to do so, I would be glad to hear that he would be willing to give it consideration. 
     
     I had recently brought to my notice a Workmen's Compensation case where a solicitor charged the widow of a motor-lorry driver £50 for costs. The action was successful and costs were given against the employer.  The solicitor deducted the £50 from the compensation of about £240 awarded to the widow.  The widow knew nothing about taxing costs and was naturally chary about seeking further legal advice elsewhere.  That is only one slight illustration of the very many occasions when poor persons are unable to get the advantage that the courts of justice give, because of the fact that the legal costs are so utterly beyond their reach, and, when the case is won, the costs eat up all the damages that may be given.  Apart from that class of case, there is also the case of the prisoner who is undefended and who cannot get proper advice or assistance.   I was hopeful that the Minister might have been able to find a way to meet such cases as I have spoken of, and I still hope that it may be found possible to introduce into the system of law some State advisers for poor people who are not able to afford the ordinary cost of litigation. 
     
      
       The statements which the Minister made of the purpose of this Bill seem to have pleased Deputy Johnson, as it has pleased most Deputies.  I think the Minister's statement has convinced most of us that the terms of the Bill are entirely suited to the purpose for which it was designed.  In regard to Part I., the removal of the sheriffs and undersheriffs and the grouping of the authority in a county registrar will be of the greatest advantage to legal gentlemen locally and to the public at large. There is only one comment that occurs to me in connection with that part of the Bill, that is, in regard to the probate offices.  As the Minister said, the probate office for County Donegal had hitherto been in Londonderry, which unfortunately, is not now in this State. I would ask the Minister, as I have not opportunity for finding out myself, whether there is not sufficient work for a probate office for the County Donegal itself at Letterkenny, and if so, that one might be set up there. 
       In regard to the other portions of the Bill with reference to the High Courts.  I think that the arrangements are excellent and that the Minister has fully justified himself.  On Part III. of the Bill I have some doubts in regard to the wisdom of the course that has been adopted with reference to the district courts clerks.  Possibly when the Bill is in Committee we will have some alterations, and I shall raise my objections on that stage.  But as the Bill comes before us and as it has been expounded by the Minister I have the greatest pleasure in supporting it. 
     
     
      
       I do not know whether it is always an advantage to be the leader of the Opposition, but in discussing this Bill the leader of the Opposition has had the first word.  In the discussion that has opened on this   Bill the leader of the present Opposition has taken advantage of his opportunity and has said the first word.  In fact he has taken out of my mouth the words that I intended to offer by way of comment upon the Bill which is essentially one for Committee.  The House, I think, will agree that the Minister has given a full and detailed exposition of the various proposals contained in it.  For that we are all grateful. With the principles underlying those proposals&mdash;principles of economy, efficiency, of compensation for existing officers, of endeavouring to get as many of the present existing trained and experienced officers to remain on in office &mdash;I am in complete accord with the manner in which the Minister has dealt with all of them.  There is only one principle embodied in the Bill, one that I think was not essential to it, with which I have to quarrel.  It is proposed to change what used to be known as judicial officers into civil servants. That, in effect, is the proposal in this Bill, and though there may be, as Deputy Johnson has said, some reasons advanced for taking that course, there certainly was no necessity for it for the proper administration of the courts. So far Deputies have not been informed of its advantages.  The patronage in the past which belonged to the judges may have been abused.  I am not here to defend the doings of the old judiciary in Ireland.  But, be that as it may, is it to be contemplated that practices which were not for the best in the past&mdash;conducted as they were by a judiciary largely, if not entirely, out of sympathy with the political aspirations of the people&mdash;would necessarily be followed now by a judiciary of our own making, a judiciary adjudicating in our own State and according to our own Constitution?  I think that the principle underlying this change is somewhat of a slur upon our present judiciary, and possibly on the members of the future judiciary of the Saorstat. 
     
     It is proposed to have three principal officers.  One of these, the new master of the High Court, will certainly have his hands full if he is to perform efficiently all the duties attached to the office, some of which were detailed for us this afternoon by the Minister.  I do not think I would be disrespectfully   describing this gentleman as the future Pooh-Bah of the law.  He is to take the place of, amongst others, the existing chief clerk.  He was described by the Minister to-night as a kind of a minor judge.  These were the words of the Minister himself.  This gentleman is to be appointed by the Executive Council and is to be removable at the pleasure of the Executive Council.  That, of course, does away with the suggestion that he is anything in the nature of a judge, because, according to the Constitution, our judges are independent of the Executive and can only be removed by a resolution of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Up to this the Chief Clerk and the Taxing Masters were appointed, it is true, by the judges, with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor.  That was under the Judicature Act, and the only method by which they could be removed was as the Minister correctly stated, by an order.  The reasons for their removal were to be stated on that order, which was to have the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor.  The new officials, the Master of the High Court and the two Taxing Masters, are to be removable, and the position is that while all officers, even minor ones, in connection with the Courts were in the past treated as judicial officers, these new officers are all to be treated as civil servants.  What I understand sub-section (3) to mean is this, that in the case of the three officers I have mentioned they would be appointed by the Executive Council and hold office at its pleasure.  Then it goes on to say, &ldquo;Every other of the said principal officers&rdquo;&mdash;that, I presume, refers to the officers mentioned in sub-section (1) of the same section&mdash;&ldquo;shall be appointed by the Minister and shall hold office at the pleasure of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  They are all to be civil servants, not judicial officers. 
     
      
       The Deputy has used the words &ldquo;judicial officers&rdquo; so often, perhaps he will not mind me intervening to ask him what he means by those words.  Does he mean an officer performing judicial functions, or an officer appointed by a judge on grounds of consanguinity or otherwise? 
     
     
     
      
       What I mean is, an officer performing duties such as the Minister has described as quasi-judicial duties.  I would, for instance, say that the present chief clerk and the present taxing masters are judicial officers and, as such, their method of appointment and their mode of removal are completely different from those of ordinary civil servants.  The proposal now is to change that method and, instead of having the administrative control of the Courts of Justice entirely in the hands of the judiciary, it shall be at the disposal of the then Executive Council.  I do not know whether this is the proper time to discuss any proposed amendment to that contemplated change, but if the Minister and his Executive have made up their minds, if they are convinced, and if they obtain the sanction of this House to change the system of relationship between the Judiciary and the Executive to this extent, then I suggest as a reasonable amendment to their new proposal that if these officers are to be appointed by the Minister for Justice they should, at any rate, not be removable except by the same system by which the previous judicial officers were removable, substituting the present Chief Justice for the then Lord Chancellor. 
     
     Perhaps I might be able to explain my proposal in more simple language by suggesting that, instead of, as now proposed, having these officers removable by the judge who appointed them with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor and for reasons to be stated on the order of removal, they should be removable by the Minister for Justice with the concurrence of the Chief Justice for reasons to be stated on the order of removal.  I say that that, to a certain extent, might ensure the stability and also, perhaps, the independence of those judicial officers.  Let them be appointed, if the Minister so chooses, in the first place by the Executive Council, but having been appointed to what I term &ldquo;judicial offices&rdquo; and to what the Minister terms in regard to the masters of the High Court &ldquo;quasi-judicial offices,&rdquo; let them be removable only by the Minister with the concurrence of the   Chief Justice for reasons stated on the order of removal.  That is a suggestion which I throw out and it might, perhaps, be more suitably proposed on Committee Stage, but I am taking this opportunity to do it, as the Minister has stated that it will be some time before we reach the Committee Stage.  I respectfully ask him to consider the proposal I have made if he is not determined to have these officers anything more or less than ordinary civil servants.  Of course, as Deputy Johnson says, this is a very big and grave departure, and while making these suggestions I am not to be taken as approving, exactly, of the proposed change.  I am not irrevocably opposed to it.  I am open to conviction. 
     If it is considered that in regard to appointments by what was known in the old days as &ldquo;patronage,&rdquo; they should rest with the Executive Council, I suggest that the removal should not be entirely at the pleasure of that Council.  In regard to some of the details with which the Minister dealt so ably, I am not going to weary the House except to refer to one or two of them.  I listened attentively to what he said in regard to all the staffs, and, in the first place, with regard to the District Court Staffs.  He let drop a hint that it might be possible&mdash;he did not, I think, give an absolute assurance, but, perhaps, he might be induced to go a little further in that direction on the Committee Stage&mdash; that, at any rate, whole-time temporary District Clerks should be made pensionable officers.  I hope he will consider that, and, as according to him there seemed to be very few of these officers, it would not make a great difference financially, while in principle it would be a sound step to take.  These men were appointed and have acted as whole-time officers, and if such men as process-servers and others are to be treated as pensionable, it seems hardly fair that whole-time men in responsible positions, such as District Clerks, should not have equally the same benefits. I hope, therefore, between this and the Committee Stage that he will give that matter his most favourable consideration. 
     On the question of remuneration, I   must confess that I do not think the Minister has been at all ungenerous. He has laid down, in regard to the existing High Court officers, that they shall, if they choose, continue to enjoy their present salaries.  I do not think they should have any complaint in that regard, and I also think it right that when their offices are abolished, as they will be immediately by this Bill, if they seek to be re-appointed, they should not have it both ways.  Perhaps the House does not understand me.  What I mean is that they should not have the right to claim their compensation under Article 10 and at the same time be re-employed by the State.  The Minister did let fall a remark in that regard which I should like him, if he can do so, to clear up.  It is quite possible there might be in the mind of some of those officers the idea that if they sought re-employment and succeeded in getting it, and thereby forewent their rights under Article 10, it would be possible for the Government, in a very short time, to get rid of them on other terms.  The Minister said, in the case of men like that&mdash;that is, officers re-appointed and subsequently discharged&mdash;that if discharged through no fault of their own, their claim would be revived. 
     
      
       I meant if they were discharged on considerations of redundancy or things of that kind.  If men were discharged for misconduct or indiscipline in their office, there could be no question of a pension. 
     
     
      
       I think that the only difficulty in securing, as I think the Minister very fairly said he wanted to secure, the services of those trained and efficient officers, would be that they would have a suspicion lurking somewhere&mdash;I am sure unfounded&mdash;in the back of their heads, that they would be taken on at the sacrifice of their compensation under the Treaty and then be nicely sidetracked. I hope the Minister will be able to dissipate such a suspicion if it exists. 
     
     I see one defect in regard to the re-employment of the officers of the High Court.  Will there be room for them all?  It is true, as the Minister said, that some will not be re-employed, because   they might not be considered competent.  Others will not be re-employed because they, perhaps, will have reached the age-limit.  But even allowing for these two classes, I am somewhat doubtful whether there will be room for those who are left.  I hope there will be, because, as the Minister has said, I think their services would be of great benefit to the State.  There is just one point, before I leave it, that I want to deal with in regard to the High Court staff.  Section 23 provides that 
     &ldquo;in addition to the principal officers, there shall be employed in the several offices established by this Act, such and so many officers. clerks, messengers, criers and servants as the Minister shall, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, from time to time determine.&rdquo; 
     I presume it is provided that they shall be removable also at the pleasure of the Minister and the Executive Council.  Is it, therefore, seriously suggested that no crier, servant or messenger, clerk or officer in the Courts of Justice, will feel that he is a crier, servant, messenger or officer or whatever he may be, of the judges or of those in immediate control of him, but that he can do what he likes and is only removable at the discretion of the Minister for Justice?  I think that would be a very anomalous state of affairs and it would almost become ludicrous. 
     
      
       Would the Deputy mind elaborating that point? 
     
     
      
       It is proposed in Section 23 that all the staffs, including clerks and messengers, criers and servants shall be appointed by the Minister for Justice.  The section says that &ldquo;there shall be employed&rdquo;&mdash;the word used is not &ldquo;appointed&rdquo;&mdash;such officers of the classes I have mentioned as the Minister shall determine.  I take it from that&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong-that the Minister shall have the right to determine that employment, and shall be the one who shall be, in effect, their employer; that these officers will not be the employees or servants of the Judiciary, but that they will be the servants of the Minister for Justice.   There, again, we are encroaching on the question of the relationship between the Judiciary and the Executive and there, again, I have to be convinced that it is a wise departure, that from top to bottom&mdash;from the Master of the High Court, the highest officer of all, down to the Court criers and clerks of the lowest order&mdash;the officers shall all be appointed by the Minister or the Executive, and shall have their employment determined by the Minister or the Executive. 
       However, as I stated in my opening remarks, this is essentially a Bill for Committee.  It is very hard to discuss it in general terms.  To the main tenor of the Bill I give my whole-hearted support.  It is a Bill which is absolutely necessary, and which has been waited for for a considerable time.  I do not know what the delay has been due to, but it occurred.  It is a Bill without which the courts cannot function. As the Minister has said, the Rules cannot be laid upon the Table before the rule-making authorities know the class of people about whom they are making rules. 
       In winding up, I should like to ask the Minister when he will be in a position to have those rules laid on the Table of the Dail?  I presume this Bill will pass through the Oireachtas within a comparatively short time.  I should like if the Minister would inform me whether the rules will be ready then to be laid on the Table of this House, because the whole legal system in the country has been held up in the absence of these rules.  It is almost impossible to know what to do in the Circuit Court in regard to matters affecting procedure and costs. Litigants are anxious to proceed with their cases and have not been able to do so.  The whole Circuit Court has been considerably delayed by the absence of those rules.  If the Minister could enlighten the House upon that point, I should be much obliged. 
     
     
      
       To me this Court Officers Bill is remarkable for one notorious omission.  The declared policy of the Executive Council&mdash;a policy which has received the unanimous support of the Dail&mdash;is to make this   country Gaelic-speaking.  In pursuance of that policy, Irish has been made compulsory in the schools and, as a natural corollary, all officials of the Government should have a competent knowledge of Irish.  I am sure the Minister for Justice will be only anxious to rectify this omission and I hope he will make Irish compulsory for all new appointments under the Bill.  I know that there has been some difficulty in so far as recent appointments are concerned but they could very easily be overcome by making a rule that pension rights should not begin to count until the individual has received a certificate of competency in Irish from the Civil Service Commissioners. In so far as District Court Clerks are concerned, I think any Clerk who supervises the work of three offices should be considered a whole-time officer and should have pension rights. 
     
     
      
       I want to deal with one aspect of this Bill&mdash;that is in connection with the position of existing officers.  I am glad to see that the Minister has provided in the Bill for the continuance of the existing salaries and conditions to those officers who can be offered employment under this measure.  I think that is a desirable and commendable departure from the practice which has been pursued up to the present in connection with new schemes of organisation or schemes of reorganisation. 
     
     
      
       How is that a new departure? 
     
     
      
       It is a departure inasmuch as no such specific guarantee has been given to officers who have come under schemes of reorganisation since the Saorstat came into operation. I have only one regret in connection with the matter and that is that this provision has not been put into other schemes of reorganisation which affected the rights of transferred officers. I am sure that if it had been put in many trained Civil Servants would have been saved for the nation.  However, I am glad that this departure from the previous practice has been made and I hope that it will be followed on the occasion of every scheme   of reorganisation which comes into operation.  I hope the Executive Council will assure transferred officers, under those schemes of reorganisation, that they need have no fear that their conditions will be worsened or their salaries reduced.  If that be done, I think it will be good business for the Executive Council and good business for the nation, inasmuch as it will save many trained civil servants to the nation and enable them to continue their work without fear of their future. 
     
     
      
       The Bill before us is obviously one of far-reaching importance. Looking through it, one recognises the amount of work that its preparation entailed.  I think we may compliment the Minister for Justice on the very lucid way he has expounded to us the provisions of the Bill and the intentions of the Executive.  The Bill is based on a really businesslike reorganisation of a Department which, whatever its merits, had no claim to businesslike administration.  I have little hesitation in commending the Bill as a businesslike reorganisation of the Department from top to bottom.  It is quite clear that the reorganisation makes for economy and for efficiency. Viewing the measure as I do, I cannot pay it a better compliment than to say that, from the business point of view, I could not suggest many improvements in it. 
     
     It seems to me that in dealing with the question the Ministry has taken the whole court system and has welded it into a Department which, in my judgment, should work satisfactorily.  I think that the economies that can be secured on these lines will be very considerable. Having said so much, it is necessary to say that my criticism of the Bill begins and ends.  The operation of the Bill does not end there, and I hope that the legal profession as a whole, solicitors, barristers and judges, will concentrate on the legal aspects and let us have the benefit of their views on the Committee Stage.  I confess that I would be entirely incompetent to follow the procedure and the intricacies of the law itself.  Deputy Johnson has raised a very important question, and if the implications that he attaches to the change are sound,   it must be a matter of grave consideration for members of the Dail on the Committee Stage, so that the intention of the Constitution and of previous Acts is carried out.  That is to say, that the judicature shall be entirely independent of political influences, in so far as anything can be independent of politics.  I think that is a difficult thing to achieve.  It would be unfortunate if any large body of the people came to the conclusion that the operation of the law could be, in any way, affected by active political considerations. In a small community such as ours, I think it will be very difficult to separate the various influences that are operating at any particular time. What I mean is, that it is almost impossible to avoid dovetailing the different sections of the people into a Department.  It is very hard to effect a complete severence of any Department from the influences which must necessarily be brought to bear upon it in a small community. 
     The ideal Deputy Johnson sets before us is that the Executive Council should not have any power to influence judges or appointments in connection with the courts.  If that was carried into effect it would mean that the law would have to stand by itself, and there would have to be a separate means of making appointments as compared with the other Departments of the State.  I do not think that could be carried out in its entirety.  Appointments must have a political source if the Dail is going to have control of administration.  Where the danger would be, is that after the appointment the political influences should still continue. That is a phase of the change that, I presume, will be taken into consideration by people who are better able to express an opinion on it than I am.  I hope that the Bill will receive the fullest criticism from that point of view.  As far as I am able to criticise it, I think the Bill is an excellent one. It is a Bill in the right direction, and in operation I think it can be made to work without in any way diminishing the influence of the judiciary on the community.  I am only referring to the judicial side of the Bill, so that I may be free to criticise amendments   brought forward on the Committee Stage.  At present I have nothing but commendation for the Bill. 
     
      
       Deputy Redmond said there had been undue delay in introducing this Bill.  Of course, that statement is absolutely true and absolutely safe.  There is delay in introducing every Bill, and the Deputy will probably agree that it is just as well there is. 
     
     
      
       I wish there was more delay sometimes. 
     
     
      
       As to the question of undue delay, I put it to the Deputy that no one is in a position&mdash;not even myself&mdash;to judge of that, because I would naturally be biassed in favour of one Bill rather than the other.  The factors are so numerous and so complex that I do not know of anyone who could decide fairly as to whether or not in the case of this particular Bill, or of any Bill, the delay has been undue. The Bill was a very difficult one to prepare.  It is a highly technical Bill and I think that the time spent on its preparation has been well spent.  It is certainly not the kind of building that should be done in a hurry.  Such as it is, it is before the Dail, and the criticism&mdash;even the Deputy's criticism&mdash;has not been of a devastating nature. Deputy Johnson got on a theme of his as to the correct relation between the judiciary and the Executive.  One could read too much about subjects of that kind. 
     
     
      
       And one could read too little. 
     
     
      
       Possibly, but I put it to the Deputy that he is the victim of tradition in a way, and perhaps of over-reading in another way.  He envisages the judiciary as some vast thing apart, that moves majestically on its way, apart from and independent of every other phase of our existence. That, of course, is not so.  It is notoriously not the case.  On reflection the Deputy will probably realise that every judiciary leans on the Executive for the enforcement of its orders, and for the enforcement of its decrees.  There are points of contact   like that that one has not been able to get away from in any real State in this world, as distinct from an imaginary state in some other world.  While Deputy Johnson was speaking something came to my mind that I did read &mdash;because I do sometimes read&mdash;about an instance in America where a certain Judge Marshall had given a decision which was unpopular with the President, and the comment was, &ldquo;Marshall has given his decision; let him execute it.&rdquo;  There was a refusal to carry it out.  The Deputy might seize on that and weave an argument about it.  He might say, &ldquo;That, perhaps, could be moulded into an argument in favour of the judges having their own staff, and having the carrying out of Executive functions that follow on the giving of a judicial decision.&rdquo;  That, of course, means two states almost, and it is not practicable.  I put it to him that the issue is not so much a question of abstraction as between the Executive and the judiciary, but a question, for one thing, as between responsible and irresponsible patronages, and for another thing, as between control of the court staffs and no control whatever.  I mean that whereas the Deputy is thinking in terms of constitutional abstractions I, perhaps, from the nature of the position, have to think in terms of actualities of the position.  Now, what is the business of a judge?  The layman who has not over-read himself might think there is a lot to be said for the point of view that it is the business of a judge to judge an issue arising in litigation that comes before him, and to leave it at that.  The Deputy, with his view obscured perhaps by tradition of what he has seen and is accustomed to, is hanging grimly to the idea that it is not merely the business of a judge to judge, but that it is also his business to act to some extent as an administrative officer, and to control the large staff appointed by himself for reasons that might be good reasons, or bad or middling reasons.  At any rate, his duties and functions go beyond that of determining questions of law brought before him by a litigant, and run to administration and control of big   staffs.  He may not be at all fitted for administration and the control of staffs. 
     
     
      
       A Cabinet Minister may not either. 
     
     
      
       Quite, and if not his sins will find him out and he will answer for them.  It is different with a judge.  He cannot be removed except for misconduct in office.  He cannot be removed for failure to control staffs. He may be eminently unfitted for that kind of work.  It does not follow that because a man is learned in the law that he has great administrative skill. He probably has very little administrative experience from the nature of the case.  He may have spent his life as a Chancery lawyer and be appointed to the judiciary, but it does not follow that he has any skill, bent or experience of administration, yet according to the Deputy he is to control the staff and to see that office organisation is good, that the public requirements are adequately met, and covered in all the offices that are attached to the courts.  Why is that?  What is there to be said for that view?  I thought we had settled this issue in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  I thought we had settled it when we laid down in the schedule as the first duty of the Minister for Justice that he was to be responsible for all courts of justice, and the officers thereof save in so far as the same are reserved to the Executive Council, or are excepted from the authority of the Executive Council, or the Executive Minister.  But apparently we have not settled that.  The question is raised now as a great constitutional issue&mdash;who is to control the courts' staffs, who is to answer for them, if anyone is to answer for them? I do not see how there can be any responsibility for them if the view is taken that they should be appointed by and controlled by the judges, who are not responsible to Parliament, and who cannot be removed from office except by a vote of both Houses for gross misconduct amounting to corruption in the fulfilment of their office. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister contemplate the possibility that conduct of the taxing master or the chief   registrar may be the subject of frequent discussions in this House? 
     
     
      
       I am trying to sound the depths or scale the heights of the Deputy's argument.  His point of view is that we are engaged on something that is unwise, or at any rate the wisdom of which has yet to be shown to him, that we are engaged on a process which he calls converting judicial officers&mdash;it was Deputy Redmond who used the words, but the idea is the same&mdash;into civil servants, that we are bringing about some extraordinary change, the soundness of which is at least doubtful.  The change we are bringing about is, it is proposed that in future there shall be some responsibility for the highly-paid officers who are attached to the courts system.  In the past there was not any, and perhaps that is why down in the courts you had, far more than in any other phase of public life, the most wanton corruption and the grossest redundancy of staff.  Every judge was a law unto himself.  His court was a watertight compartment.  He had complete power of patronage there, and he possibly had neither the aptitude nor the time to control the work that went on there to satisfy himself that it was properly apportioned, that men's time was fully occupied, and that they were giving value for their salaries. 
     
     
      
       May I ask the Minister whether it would not be possible under this system for a question to come before the master of the High Court arising as between an individual of the State and the State itself, or between an individual of the State and a department of the State, and whether it would be proper for such question to be determined not by an independent judicial officer, but by a civil servant removable by the Executive Council? 
     
     
      
       There is no final jurisdiction with the master. 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       That is No. 1.  As regards No. 2, Deputy Redmond and Deputy Johnson seem to consider that the judges fell from heaven. 
     
     
     
      
       I do not at all consider that. 
     
     
      
       The judges were appointed by the Executive Council. 
     
     
      
       I am aware of that.  They cannot be removed by the Executive Council. 
     
     
      
       They were appointed by the Executive Council, just as the master of the central office will be appointed by the Executive Council. 
     
     
      
       The judges cannot be removed by the Executive Council.  They can be removed only by a resolution of the Oireachtas.  The proposal is that the master of the High Court shall be removable by the Executive Council. 
     
     
      
       Really, that is a tortuous mentality.  The Deputy envisages something arising within the very limited jurisdiction of the master of the central office. 
     
     
      
       The very big jurisdiction. 
     
     
      
       As I say, the Deputy envisages something arising within the very limited jurisdiction of the master which will enable the Executive Council to hurl him out of office if he gives a decision in one way rather than in another. 
     
     
      
       At any rate it gives them power to do it and that is what I object to. 
     
     
      
       We are, therefore, dealing with things that Deputy Redmond or Deputy Johnson fears might happen.  You have these intangible fears.  The most that is claimed for them is that they are theoretically possible; technically they could take place.  As against that what is the actual picture you have from the other system?  The Deputy knows it better than I do and, in a peculiar kind of way, he almost suggests that it ought to continue&mdash;that judges ought to continue making appointments and be responsible for staff.  He knows&mdash;he must know&mdash;that they are appointed for their learning in the law and not for their administrative capacity or experience.   Even if they had administrative capacity and experience they would not have the time to control staff.  The judges are overworked.  It is just a question whether, in future, there will not have to be application made here for more judges.  These are the men who are to control the court staffs, according to Deputies Redmond and Johnson.  The whole thing is that there is a reluctance to face the fact that there has to be a clean break from that whole system of irresponsible patronage, judicial patronage, patronage for the exercise of which there was no responsibility to the people through any Parliament.  That is what has given you the state of affairs on which the British Treasury expert had to launch his censures in 1921, censures which are now on record in my office.  The Deputy knows as well as I do of the Mallow division and the Sheep-walk, and the other little pockets and burrows in the courts. 
     
     
      
       I hold no brief for the past. 
     
     
      
       No.  Whereas the judiciary of the past, according to Deputy Redmond, were sons of darkness, the judiciary of the future will be all children of the morning, sons of light. 
     
     
      
       Sons of rest. 
     
     
      
       That is not the position.  It is not that you had one class of men inherently corrupt and that you had another class of men who, from the very nature of things, were impeccable.  It is simply that men were placed in a position subject to a particular temptation, and in the most good-humoured and human-nature way they yielded.  The thing became reverend by precedent and long practice.  It became the established thing, and judge after judge succumbed to it.  No doubt, his own view, and the view of his colleagues in the world to which he belonged, was that he would be a great fool if he did not.  There were very few great fools in that respect, as the Deputy knows.  Now we are to hesitate to change the system because, forsooth, we are making judicial officers   into civil servants.  The fact is we are providing for part of the public administration, and a very costly part. We are providing what did not exist before, control and responsibility. There was neither one nor the other in the past. 
     
     
      
       As the only old court officer present, let me say this discussion is painful to me. 
     
     
      
       I should be more merciful to Deputy Professor MacNeill's blushes; but he knows that the picture I am painting is substantially accurate. 
     
     
      
       With notable exceptions. 
     
     
      
       It is, at least, far more accurate than any picture painted here to-night; it is far more accurate than the gloomy picture outlined by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Redmond as to the future state of affairs once these judicial officers become civil servants. 
     
     
      
       We are entering on a revolution, and I would like the people to know that we are entering on a revolution. 
     
     
      
       If I am not mistaken, the staffs used to be controlled by the Lord Chancellor, who had no connection at all with either government or politics. 
     
     
      
       He did not control some of them. 
     
     
      
       resumed the Chair. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Johnson spoke of under-sheriffs as returning officers, and he said that in the future that duty might devolve on the county registrar.  He saw an objection to that. The under-sheriff performed this duty because of the detached position he occupied. 
     
     
      
       What was the origin of it? 
     
     
      
       It was really a fairly direct appointment by the Executive. He was appointed originally by the High Sheriff, who was appointed   by the Lord Lieutenant.  Since 1920 he has been appointed directly by the Executive and he has been responsible for parliamentary elections.  As between the responsibility of an under-sheriff appointed by the Executive and the responsibility of the county registrar similarly appointed, there is, of course, nothing to choose.  I agree there might be a lot said in regard to questions connected with elections&mdash; questions, for instance, as to the preparation of the register, responsibility for the franchise generally, and the actual machinery on election day; but it does not just go to the root of things that the duties of the under-sheriff in that respect may devolve in future on the county registrar because the two of them are just officials appointed by the Executive Council.  Deputy Doherty referred to the Probate Registry, and in doing so he really proved my case.  I said there had been no local Probate Registry for Donegal since the establishment of the Free State, inasmuch as it was cut off from Derry, and there had been no outcry as to any inconvenience existing by having to do business with the principal Registrar. I think I saw in Deputy Doherty's attitude an emphasising of my point.  It was quite clear that he never heard of any inconvenience before, and it is also quite clear that his first reaction, on hearing that there was no Probate Registry in Donegal, was that there ought to be one immediately established in Lifford, if for no other reason than to provide employment for persons at Lifford and to add to the amenities of the town. 
     
     Now, the question of economy was mentioned by Deputy Hewat.  I wonder would it be a startlingly new point of view if I were to suggest to the Deputy that there can be more kinds of economy than one.  There can be economy of better value and economy of better service.  This Bill will certainly not result immediately in any considerable economy of the other kind, the kind I suspect that the Deputy is more out after, as the phrase goes.  It will not result immediately, at any rate, in a very substantial reduction of expenses.  It will result immediately, and increasingly, in better   service, better value for expenditure, and there will, of course, in time, be that other kind of economy also, in that the system will be a cheaper and a more compact system than that which obtained in the past.  But there is a redundancy in the Court staff which cannot disappear with the passing of this Bill, because that would involve one kind of expenditure instead of another.  We have the Article 10 position, and these people have their rights and it seems better business to continue to employ those people to the maximum extent to which they can be usefully employed, than to put them out absolutely unproductively on the pensions list, giving return for the money they would receive.  However, this Bill will not cure the redundancy in the Court staffs immediately, and all I can say with definiteness as to its immediate result is that I think there will come quickly following upon the Bill a very considerable improvement in the return for salaries paid in that direction. 
     
      
       Can the Minister give us some sort of idea of the comparative cost when these changes get into working order.  It would be very useful for the Committee Stage.  I do not expect enormous economy straight away. 
     
     
      
       Quite so, but I only threw out these statements as warnings.  Deputy McBride referred to the question of Irish.  Of course the future recruits to that branch of the service will pass through the machinery of the Civil Service Commission and will have to comply with the requirements of that body in the matter of Irish as in the matter of other subjects.  But the existing officers of the Courts&mdash;I do not suppose the Deputy is suggesting it&mdash;cannot be put through a sieve retaining only those who are fluent Irish speakers. Recruiting to the service in the future will, of course, be on a different plane. 
     
     
      
       But the new registrars must qualify in Irish? 
     
     
      
       I deprecate the tendency to use the Irish language as a spearhead for jobbery. 
     
     
     
      
       I do not think the Minister should try to lead the House to believe that it would be jobbery to have a knowledge of Irish. 
     
     
      
       No, I simply threw out the remark at random and out of its context.  The Deputy need not take it as arising particularly from any suggestion of his unless he so wishes, but I do deprecate the tendency which I occasionally observe to use the Irish language simply as a useful spearhead for jobbery to be thrown aside when not needed. 
     
     
      
       I hope the Minister does not insinuate that I ever did so. I have never done so.  I consider it is quite wrong for the Minister to make such insinuations. 
     
     
      
       Did the Deputy ever recommend District Court Clerks to me in the Mayo area who were not fluent Irish speakers? 
     
     
      
       I did, but I thought they would qualify in Irish after a certain time. 
     
     
      
       After many days. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put, and agreed to. 
       Ordered for Third Stage (Thursday), 25th March. 
     
   
   
     DAMAGE TO PROPERTY (COMPENSATION) (AMENDMENT) BILL, 1926&mdash;SECOND STAGE. 
     
      
       I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The purpose of it is to give legislative effect to Articles 3 and 4 of the Agreement of December last amending the Treaty. The Bill provides, in the first place, for the payment of the ten per cent. addition to the awards given under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act of 1923.  It was provided in the Agreement that those increases should be made by means of 5 per cent. stock.  A considerable amount of thought has been given to the question of whether it was worth while issuing a new five per cent. stock, or whether payment should preferably be made by   issues of the existing compensation stock.  It was felt undesirable to issue new stock for small amounts.  From the point of view of the position of our Government securities on the market it is desirable not to have a variety of securities, but only a few varieties of securities which will in consequence be easily marketable and easily disposed of and easy to buy for those who want to buy Government securities. 
       Having come to the decision that we should, so far as we were issuing stock, issue what would be the existing stock, we did not see that it would be possible to make any alteration in the amounts in which the stock would be issued.  The present stock is issued in multiples of £50.  Even if we had decided to issue new stock we would certainly not have issued any multiples less than £10, because the issue of quantities of stock in very small amounts involves a good deal of bookkeeping and a good deal of expense in management that is not worth while. We decided, therefore, to pay these increases by issuing compensation stock and paying broken amounts under £50 in cash. 
     
     The cost of this ten per cent. addition will really not be very much because the ten per cent. increase will not apply to the whole of the post-truce compensation payments.  In the first place, compensation for railway damage was excluded from the scope of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923.  That was provided for by agreement with the Railway Companies and the provision for ten per cent. increase does not apply there. Compensation for personal injuries is not affected by the agreement.  The ten per cent. increase does not apply to them.  Then there are certain other cases which are excluded.  For instance, where R.I.C. barracks were burned down the owner was entitled to compensation, but the Gardai authorities wanted new barracks as quickly as possible.  Perhaps the owner might have been slow to build, so that what happened was that the Board of Works acquired the site from the owner with the right of compensation attached.  In certain cases compensation was simply paid out of the Vote to   the Board of Works for the erection of the new barracks.  In such cases, naturally, ten per cent. additional will not be paid over to the Board of Works.  The result of these deductions from the total amount of compensation payable is that not more than between £350,000 and £400,000 would have to be found.  That will be the amount that will be required for the ten per cent. additional.  Of that sum, roughly half will have to be provided in cash as we are issuing compensation stock in multiples of £50 and about half will be paid by the issue of stock.  Of course the cash portion of this amount is a capital charge, which naturally the Government will borrow to meet.  That is, we will not include this £200,000 or £175,000 in the moneys that have to be found in the coming year by taxation. 
     The Bill provides that in respect of report cases, just as in respect of decrees, the amount shall be increased by ten per cent.  In the case of a decree ten per cent. of an increase must be paid but in the case of a report it does not follow that the ten per cent. will be paid.  In certain cases people got reports but no payment was made and, of course, the ten per cent.  will not be paid in these cases.  In some cases a person got a report say for £200&mdash;£100 in respect of one particular item and £100 in respect of another particular item, but on examination in the Department of Finance one item may have been disallowed and the other item paid for, so that only £100 was paid.  In that case the ten per cent. would only be paid in respect of the item allowed.  Although the report was for £200 and this Bill will give us power to pay £20 extra, we will not pay the £20 extra.  We will simply pay ten per cent. on the amount allowed by the Department of Finance. 
     It is not proposed to attach any reinstatement condition in the case of awards to the additional sum.  If a man had built a house for, say, £1,500 and was entitled to get £150 extra, it would be, we feel, unfair to insist that he should do something else to the house costing £150.  I think in the great majority of cases, it will be found that the person rebuilding has had to provide money in addition to the amount allowed by the court.  I suppose   in all cases such persons have had to raise money by loan in addition to the money they received from the court in order to carry out reconstruction. The terms of the Act made that necessary, because the difference in value between the new building and the old building is allowed for in assessing the amounts.  Consequently, the general position is that people will have spent more on reinstatement than they actually receive in their awards, and the amounts payable under this Bill will, perhaps, only replace in part, the money which these people had to find. It would be, we believe, utterly impracticable to insist that further work should be done for the ten per cent. Then in the small cases, the cost of inspection and of seeing that the work was done, would be disproportionate. 
     Section V. provides that the judges shall continue to assess the compensation on the principles that have guided them hitherto, and that the addition shall simply be made afterwards. 
     Section VI. provides for the annuity to the British Government.  This annuity represents a sum of, roughly, £4,900,000, the interest figure being 43⁄4 per cent.  That 43⁄4 per cent. is appreciably lower than we could borrow for. We certainly could not borrow at less than the figure which we borrowed at when the National Loan was issued&mdash;51⁄4 per cent. plus a certain fraction&mdash;so that there is a gain of 1⁄2 per cent.  I do not say that that advantage of 1⁄2 per cent.  will continue over the whole period of 60 years, but I do think that it is a distinct advantage to pay an annuity rather than cash at present.  It would be undesirable when we will have to raise other loans, that we should have to go to the market for this sum of nearly £5,000,000.  It is a distinct advantage for us now to settle on an annuity basis, rather than a cash basis.  Even if some time before the expiry of 60 years interest sinks to less than 43⁄4 per cent., at any rate, that is not going to happen for a considerable time, and, on the balance over the period, I do not think it will be found, even in the long run, that there is a disadvantage in paying an annuity for such a long period as 60 years at this rate of interest, and there is, as I said, a definite advantage at present. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister say for what years this addition of 10 per cent. will be payable? 
     
     
      
       For the period covered by the principal Act&mdash;the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act&mdash;from the date of the truce to, I think, 12th May, 1923. 
     
     
      
       On the plea that Minister have made so frequently, and that they have been so eloquently backed up in both in the Press and in the Dail, and perhaps also with the support of Deputy O'Mara and Deputy Heffernan, I propose to ask the Dail not to agree to the Second Reading of this Bill, because of inability to pay those moneys which we are not obliged to pay.  As to the £5,000,000 referred to, Article 3 of the Treaty (Confirmation Agreement) Act only obliged us to enter into agreements at such time and in such manner as may be agreed upon without any obligation to pay this money at present, and I think it is, in all the circumstances, unfortunate that we should be asked to raise £400,000 next year for the purpose of paying this money, if half that is stated to be true is well founded.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us if we can afford to pay £400,000 that it is unnecessary to pay in this coming year? If that is so, then I think we ought to have had some assurances during the last few weeks which would have revived public faith and confidence. If it is not so, then we should not be called upon to pay at this time.  The obligation which the Ministers entered into in December, and which was confirmed by the Dail and Seanad, in respect to this, did not fix any date at which we should begin to pay.  I, therefore, ask the Dail to agree that this is not the time when we should begin to pay; that we should wait until prosperity comes, until we have fewer liabilities in respect to the Agreement of December, 1921, before the new Agreement, which was to amend that, begins to operate, in so far as this particular Section 3 of that Agreement applies.  On the ground of inability to pay, on the ground of the necessity for economy and reduction of taxation rather than increase of taxation, I ask   the Dail not to agree to the Second Reading of this Bill which contains this particular provision. 
       In regard to the increase of 10 per cent. in compensation, I suppose we are bound by the provisions of our previous Act to pay such a sum, and being so bound, I am not very much concerned whether we should pay it in ten-shilling notes, pound notes or Bank of England £5 notes.  It is not really of very much concern how it will be paid. That is a matter, I suppose, more for the convenience of the Minister for Finance than for anybody else.  But I do propose to ask the Dail to limit his power to pay in respect to these compensation awards in so far as the reinstatement provisions or conditions which have been imposed have not been carried out.  I think we ought to take the opportunity of insisting, if we can by this means, that where reinstatement conditions were imposed in the awards they shall be obligatory and, if they are not carried out, that the 10 per cent. shall not be added to the total award.  There have been a number of cases&mdash;some of considerable importance&mdash;where the recipients of awards have pocketed the whole sum and simply left the empty shells of the burned buildings. 
     
     Wherever it has been found desirable on the part of the courts to insert a reinstatement condition in respect of half the sum, as far as we can use this method of bringing pressure we should do so, because it will add a good deal to the circulation of money in the country, and I do not think there will be any grievance on the part of the people getting this added benefit which they did not expect, which was a voluntary grant issuing from the heart of the President.  It was very kind and very gracious of him, and I am sure they will remember him in their prayers.  But the Dail thought it was an unpleasant duty, although they succumbed to the blandishments of the President, thought it was the lesser of two evils, and agreed to pay this sum of money&mdash;I was going to say as an act of grace but really as an act of profligacy&mdash;an entirely unnecessary obligation which we took upon ourselves, but which, I suppose, will have   to be fulfilled.  As to whether it is necessary to pay this at present I am not sure.  I do not think it is.  But the sum is smaller than the other and it will not necessarily be paid in cash, because it will not come upon the Budget for the coming year, as the Minister has explained.  So that on that score I do not think we need raise any questions as to the burden that will be borne.  But on the other question, the question of raising £400,000 additional taxation in the coming year, I will ask every Deputy who has ever spoken one word about economy, or who has ever thought for a moment of the desirability of reducing taxation or of cutting down expenditure, to vote for the rejection of a Bill which contains this clause. 
     
      
       I desire to support Deputy Johnson's motion to reject the Bill.  To me, and I hope Deputies will view it in that light.  It is simply the first fruits of this great London victory that was boosted in the Press.  I would like to ask a question of the Minister for Finance, especially with regard to the latter part of the Title&mdash;&ldquo;and to authorise the issue out of the Central Fund of the sums necessary to meet the obligations undertaken by the Irish Free State by Article 3 of the Agreement made on the 3rd day of December, 1925, between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State.&rdquo; Why is the Minister putting these sums on the Central Fund?  Is it the resolve of the Government to withdraw this altogether from the sphere of criticism which it would necessarily be subjected to by coming annually on the Estimates?  That may be a good policy. It is certainly a good policy for the Ministry, but some of us will not support and endorse that policy.  This Dail will last only about a year and a half, and it is only fair and right to give a subsequent Dail an opportunity of reviewing, or rejecting, if it so wishes, the commitments that this Dail has entered into.  I contend that the only means of doing that is, not to put this payment on the Central Fund, but to put it on the Estimates, so that it may be voted annually. 
     
     It is, no doubt, held that this 10 percent.   is an act of grace, and by it that any injustices contained in the Act of 1923 are removed.  I do not feel that such a thing has ensued.  I feel that. if anything, the differentiation has been more marked, that the persons who did come under the scope of the Act of 1923 are, relatively, put in a better position than those who were excluded.  Take, for instance, the seizures of land.  Persons got reports with regard to these, I understand, but these reports were definitely turned down.  Even an appeal to the Supreme Court failed to establish the right of parties whose lands were seized to secure justice, or the right to come within the terms of the Damage to Property Act of 1923.  &ldquo;The land for the people, the road for the bullock,&rdquo; is an old cry.  I believe it is the darling sin of the Minister for Posts.  However, the effect has been that a man whose lands were seized from 1918 to 1922 or 1923 never got a penny benefit, and he will receive nothing under this new Bill that we are called on to endorse. It is well to bear this in mind, that it was because of the direct pressure of the British Government, pressure put on our Executive, to assist persons who were friendly to the British Government.  That, and that alone, it is that has caused the insertion of this 10 per cent.  It is true there was the saving grace that it should apply all round, but we might as well face the kernel of the thing, that it was really these persons, who are supposed to be ex-Unionists, who were the immediate concern of the British Government. 
     My mind can go back a number of years.  It can go back to 1917, and I can remember the time when&mdash;I will not say all ex-Unionists, but I do say this, and say it very definitely&mdash;in the case of some ex-Unionists, I have direct knowledge of the fact that they voted on an issue in a manner which is almost unbelievable.  They voted for one who had been in arms against the King to whom they affected allegiance.  Not that they sympathised with the rebel&mdash; not a bit of it; they did it because they thought that they could dish the constitutionally expressed demands of the Irish people for Home Rule&mdash;a   Machiavelian policy undoubtedly.  But what has happened?  Their houses, in many instances, went down in the conflict that afterwards ensued, and the Irish taxpayers, the people who have to work and earn money, are called upon to pay to-day for a policy which these men contributed to.  I hold that that is not quite a fair proposition.  I would be glad if the thing were feasible&mdash;but, of course, I admit frankly that at this stage it is not feasible&mdash;that the people who voted with these instincts, who voted for what I call criminal and profligate politics, should be deprived, not only of the ten per cent. they are getting under this Bill, but of every penny they got under the Act of 1923.  I take this viewpoint in justification of my attitude: I look upon these people, in supporting a certain policy and voting for a man that they held to be an anarch and a rebel, as having taken a deliberate step in the destruction of their own homes. 
     
      
       What is the relevancy of this? 
     
     
      
       May I say, sir, that in the Act of 1923, there is a precedent laid down, that those who engaged in activities against the State were precluded from getting compensation. This Bill is to make repayment to the British Government of moneys which the British Government had to accept liability for some years back, owing to the state of turmoil here. 
     
     
      
       But there is no connection between the 1923 Act and the repayment to the British Government.  The 1923 Act concerns damage done after the Truce. 
     
     
      
       Article 3 deals with the British Government's liability. 
     
     
      
       The 1923 Act and the ten per cent. increase are the same. 
     
     
      
       But this is all included in this Bill. 
     
     
      
       I am not able to follow the Deputy's argument. That is my difficulty.  I do not see how the question of people voting at an election   arises on the ten per cent. increase here. 
     
     
      
       I refer to Section 6, which says: &ldquo;For discharging the liability assumed by the Irish Free State by Article 3 of the Agreement made on 3rd day of December, 1925, between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State amending and supplementing the Treaty of 1921.&rdquo;  The Act of 1923 dealt with the whole question of compensation for the period from January 21st, 1919, down to the 12th March, 1923.  The citation of this Bill is: &ldquo;The Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts, 1923 and 1924, and this Act may be cited together as the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923 to 1926.&rdquo;  I contend that last section puts me in order before the House.  I would be glad if it were feasible to exclude such people as I referred to.  There is a precedent in the Act of 1923 which excluded those who took steps inimical to the public weal, people who acted on a policy which was contrary to all Governmental policies.  I would be glad to apply that precedent to those people who, seven or eight years ago, voted for a policy that they did not believe in.  I emphasise that they did not believe in that policy, but acted in that way because they believed that, by so doing, they could dish the hopes and the constitutionally and legitimately expressed desires of the Irish people. 
     
     
      
       No one was excluded under the Act of 1923 for voting.  They could vote any way they liked. 
     
     
      
       &ldquo;For doing any act.&rdquo;  Voting is doing an act.  The seizure of valuables, such as jewellery and money, was excluded from the Act of 1923.  There is nothing in this Bill which attempts to repair the damage done to persons who, in several cases, suffered very grave injustice, indeed. In fact, the position is accentuated against them.  They see other persons getting a 10 per cent. increase, while the terms of the original Act are maintained in all their stringency against them.  I would be glad to get some explanation from the Government as   to Section 6.  Why was it that they agreed to accept liability, and yet failed to get satisfactory explanation as to the damage done by the British forces in the period from 1919 to 1921? Some sort of lame excuse was certainly put forward here.  It was said that England was agreeing to wipe out her claim&mdash;the reputed obligation of Ireland in respect of the National Debt.  It was held then that we should be generous and could afford to be generous. That is not my contention.  I look upon the mere acceptance of this as a tacit recognition of a debt which has never been ascertained.  The question of a national debt is a rather big one.  I hold that no steps whatever have been taken to determine it.  Our representatives must have held that we owed something to the British Government in respect of the Great War debt and the whole of the National Debt.  That was done without any steps having been taken to determine what was excluded.  I submit it is not a fair proposition that we should accept liability for the damage done without knowing what was excluded.  I profoundly disagree with that. 
     
     Why is it that we are called upon to meet this debt of four or five millions by an annuity of a quarter of a million, extending over sixty years?  The Government say they got the money at 43⁄4 per cent.  The British Government compounded with many of its creditors within the past few years.  Three years ago they made financial arrangements with the United States.  I wonder if they got 43⁄4 per cent. in the case of the Italian debt.  Did the Italians give them 43⁄4 per cent. interest on their money?  No, nor anything like it.  I have not the figures beside me at the moment, but I know that the Italians got large remissions on the principal sum as well as a low rate of interest, the effect of which will be to extinguish the debt in a comparatively short time, a period certainly much shorter than that during which we will be called upon to pay.  They got all their commitments added together, so that the actual sum they are to pay does not amount to anything like the debt, that on paper, at least, they were liable to Great Britain for.  In our case we are   to pay annually a quarter of a million for sixty years.  The present proposal is that we pay £400,000 in the ensuing 12 months.  A payment of a quarter of a million for sixty years represents a total payment of £15,000,000 on a debt which only amounted to between four and five millions.  The Italian and the French people owed very large debts, and were in a much better position financially to meet their obligations than we are, but how did they get off? Not by paying three times the amount which, in the first instance, they borrowed. We did not borrow this money.  They got value, we got destruction.  They are not paying three times over the same as we are doing.  We are told that this represents a great victory, that it has conferred honour, glory, and greatness and the rest of it, on the country. 
     In the Treaty of the 3rd December, 1925, there is no arrangement whatever for the repayment.  No Deputy, I am sure wants to turn down any obligations we have contracted&mdash;at least I am not prepared to do that&mdash;but I say that the method the Government asks us to endorse for this repayment is bad and inequitable.  It is a method that is not just to the over-taxed people of Ireland.  Was it not possible to get better terms?  Surely if the Italian people, the French people and the English people themselves in the case of America, the Belgians, the Czecho-Slovakians and all the countries of Europe could get such good terms from the British, we, a constituent part of the Empire, should at least get as good.  It is almost incredible to believe that we could not. But the Government, in their wisdom, or want of wisdom, tells us we have got to pay out a quarter of a million a year for sixty years.  Now, in repudiating this Bill we are not repudiating that Agreement that was entered upon on the 3rd December.  We are not breaking our bond.  The bond was given under duress certainly, but we are not breaking our bond in turning down this, because the proposed method of repayment was not divulged to the House in December last.  I emphasise that. 
     The actual terms of clause 3 of the Agreement are as follows:&mdash; 
     
       &ldquo;The Irish Free State hereby assumes all liability undertaken by the British Government in respect of malicious damage done since the 21st day of January, 1919, to property in the area now under the jurisdiction of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State, and the Government of the Irish Free State shall repay to the British Government at such time or times and in such manner as may be agreed upon, moneys already paid by the British Government in respect of such damage or liable to be so paid under obligations already incurred.&rdquo; 
     Section 6 in the Bill does not contain one word as to the method of repayment. As a matter of fact, if the Government held out they could, perhaps, have got this money free of interest, or, at best, at a low rate of interest, and the debt would not fall so heavily upon the people.  The Minister for Finance was good enough to say that they could not borrow at a lower rate.  Evidently he is unaware of the financial arrangements which great countries and big empires have made in London within the last twelve months.  Yet, he says that we could not borrow at a lower rate, and that no one has borrowed at a lower rate to his conscious knowledge, and further, that it has been a gain.  Where is the gain? What is the worth of all the money which we will have paid out in the course of sixty years?  What will £250,000 a year at 5 per cent. compound   be worth sixty years hence?  When you consider that you have fifty-nine such sums for a diminishing period in each case, it becomes merely a question of mathematics.  The Government apparently do not believe in the earning power of money.  They have got the money too soft, but they will not get any more soft money. 
     
      
       May I correct a statement of the Deputy's when he said that the House was not led to believe that this was part of the bargain.  I made the statement that it was £250,000 a year for 60 years. 
     
     
      
       Did the President make that statement in his opening speech? 
     
     
      
       The Deputy said that the House did not hear of it before. 
     
     
      
       We did hear it, but at what stage did the President tell us?  It is not in the Agreement, and we are bound to nothing except what is in the Agreement. 
     
     
      
       It was stated here.  The Deputy did hear it before in this House. 
     
     
      
       I am admitting the error.  I now move the adjournment of the debate. 
       Debate adjourned until Tuesday, 23rd March. 
       The Dail adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until Tuesday, 23rd March.
