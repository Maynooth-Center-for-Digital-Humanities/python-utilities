     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - COMPENSATION APPLICATIONS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he can state the number of applications for compensation under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, at present in his Department awaiting hearing by the Courts, and if he is aware that claimants are suffering great hardship as a result of the delay? 
     
     
      
       222 applications now remain to be heard throughout the Saorstat, and practically all of them will probably be disposed of by the end of next month.  An occasional complaint has been made as to delays in hearing cases but I am satisfied that claims have been heard as expeditiously as the heavy work of the courts allowed, and I am aware that the delay in many cases was attributable to the failure of applicants and their solicitors to furnish necessary particulars in due time. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister for Finance give us any indication as to the percentage of claims which have been awarded and have been paid? 
     
     
      
       That is a different question entirely and the Deputy will have to give me separate notice. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - PAYMENT OF PENSION COMMITTEE CLERKS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if   he will state what action has been taken or is intended to be taken as a result of the recommendation of the Old Age Pension Committee of Inquiry contained in paragraph 53 of the Report of that Committee that Clerks of Pension Committees or Sub-Committees should be paid a yearly salary instead of the present method of payment by fees. 
     
     
      
       I see no objection, on principle, to the adoption of the recommendation indicated.  The material, however, on which to base a proper and equitable scale of salaries is not yet fully available, as the Committee themselves seemed to recognise when making their recommendation.  The question is being explored and a definite decision will be come to without delay when sufficient experience has been gained of the effect which other recommendations of the Committee, already put in train, have upon the work of the clerks. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - McNAMARA ESTATES (NORTH CLARE). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice if members of the Garda Siochana seized cattle on the estates of H.V. McNamara in North Clare; if he is aware that these estates are lying derelict for years, and if he has communicated with the Land Commission with a view to having these estates properly fenced. 
     
     
      
       I understand that the under-sheriff for County Clare made a seizure of horses, cattle and sheep found on the lands in question, in pursuance of a warrant for arrears of income tax.  The seizure was not made by the Garda Siochana, but a number of Gardai were present in order to give the under-sheriff and his party the necessary protection. 
       That portion of the question which deals with the lands being, as alleged, derelict, and with the alleged necessity for fencing, does not appear to be a matter for the Minister for Justice. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister indicate by what authority the under-sheriff   seized the cattle and horses found on the land? 
     
     
      
       The seizure was made in accordance with the ordinary law in pursuance of a warrant for arrears of income tax. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister say if the under-sheriff made any investigation as to the owners of the stock seized on the land? 
     
     
      
       There were animals found on the land and the owner of the land owed money for income tax.  There were horses, cows and sheep&mdash;about 170 animals in all&mdash;on the land.  The land was stocked to its full capacity.  The animals were correctly seized, in accordance with the ordinary law, by the under-sheriff acting on authority. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - OVERCROWDING OF SCHOOLS (DUBLIN) 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that a large increase in the population, due to the building of a considerable number of houses in Fairview and Clontarf districts, has caused the overcrowding of schools, and if he will state whether the matter has been considered by his Department; and, if so, whether any arrangements have been made for the opening of new schools. 
     
     
      
       Arrangements have been made for the erection at Marino of (a) a school to accommodate 1,300 girls and infants, and (b) one to accommodate 1,000 boys.  The estimated cost of the erection of these buildings apart from the cost of enclosing, furniture, etc., amounts to £56,750.  A State grant of two-thirds of the cost has been sanctioned in the case of these proposed schools.  The work of building in the case of the girls' and infants' schools is in progress.  The building of the boys' school will, it is hoped, be commenced almost immediately. 
       It is understood that a proposal to establish a school at Killester is being considered locally. 
     
     The question of the establishment of   a new school for boys on the North Circular Road, adjacent to Summerhill, is also under consideration. 
     
      
       Can the Minister give any estimate of the time that will be occupied in building these schools? How long will the children be deprived of an opportunity of getting education while these schools are being built?  It is believed in the district that it will be a very long time before that opportunity offers. 
     
     
      
       As regards the first school, the one already in progress, it will take practically up to next summer, I am afraid, before it is completed. I have considered the question whether temporary accommodation could be found, but I am afraid there is no solution of that problem. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister give any indication when the boys' school will be completed? 
     
     
      
       I am afraid not.  That school will be started almost immediately.  We hope to start the building almost immediately, but as to when it will be completed, I should say it will be some time after the girls' school is completed. 
     
     
      
       Some time after? 
     
     
      
       That is a very safe answer. 
     
     
      
       Quite safe. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - OLD AGE PENSION APPLICATION (KILDARE). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware of the delay in dealing with the claim to an old age pension of John Scully, Hospital Street, Kildare, who was born on 31st August, 1856, and who handed a birth certificate with application to the local Pensions Officer on or about the 10th September, 1926, and whether he will expedite award of pension. 
     
     
      
       This old age pension claim has not, so far, come before me on appeal,   and I have, therefore, no functions in regard to it, nor have I any information about it.  I have, however, transmitted a copy of the Deputy's question and of my reply to the Minister for Finance with a view to having an inquiry made from the Revenue Commissioners. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - NEWBRIDGE ROAD IMPROVEMENT WORK. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will, in order to relieve some of the large amount of unemployment and destitution prevailing in Newbridge, Co. Kildare, instruct the Roads Board to proceed immediately with the work of reconstructing and widening of the Liffey Bridge on the Naas-Kildare Trunk Road. 
     
     
      
       I am advised that the improvement of this bridge is not urgent.  It will come up for special consideration when funds permit.  The commencement of the work under the national scheme from the bridge at Newbridge to Naas urban boundary, estimated to cost £13729, will afford considerable employment. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister give a promise that this work will be started soon so that it can be completed by the end of March next?  It is very important that this alteration should be made.  It is a very dangerous bridge and I am sure the Minister understands that. 
     
     
      
       I realise that, but the matter is, to a great extent, one for the local experts. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ROAD RECONSTRUCTION IN KILDARE. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware of the unreasonable delay in starting the works sanctioned by the Roads Board in the Naas, Newbridge, and Kildare sections of the Dublin-Maryborough Trunk Road, and whether he will, in view of the large numbers of unemployed and consequent destitution, give instructions that the work be proceeded with immediately, so that the   unemployed may obtain some relief before Christmas. 
     
     
      
       On inquiry from the County Surveyor by telephone, it was learned that the legal preliminaries incidental to entering into the contracts for the work had only just been completed, and that the documents now await the contractor's signature.  It is expected that this will be forthcoming almost immediately.  Directions are being issued that work must commence without undue delay. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister bring pressure to bear on whoever is responsible for the delay in starting this work?  Will the Minister see that the work is at once started in the different sections, so that the unemployment that exists at the present time in the three different towns will be relieved? I do not think that the Minister has any adequate realisation of the amount of suffering consequent upon unemployment in Naas, Newbridge and Kildare.  The people there seem to think that we are fooling them over this money.  The money was available for the last three or four months, but the work was left untouched, and no one seems to care whether the unemployed people get employment or not. 
     
     
      
       The delay arose over the legal preliminaries.  Difficulties that were purely legal had to be dealt with.  The other question will be a matter for the contractor who is dealing with the work. 
     
     
      
       I would like the Minister to use his influence so as to get these men employed as soon as possible. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CO. CLARE ESTATES. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether the Land Commission has purchased all or any of the estates of H.V. McNamara in Co. Clare; and, if so, what estates, or if that Department is in negotiation for the purchase of all or any of that owner's estates in Co. Clare. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission have instituted proceedings   for the acquisition of 1,146 acres of untenanted lands in the Doolin district on this estate under Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, and have also instituted similar proceedings for acquisition of 165 acres of the demesne lands at Ennistymon, but the lands have not yet been acquired by the Land Commission. 
     
     
      
       Has the Land Commission considered the desirability of deducting from the money to be paid to this landlord the amount of income tax due, instead of seizing, for the payment of income tax, the stock belonging to other people that might stray on the lands? 
     
     
      
       The trouble is that in addition to income tax there are rates due, and the Clare County Council have refused to sue this man for the rates. 
     
     
      
       Has the Land Commission refused the Clare Co. Council to deduct the entire rates from the money to be paid to this landlord? 
     
     
      
       A number of charges might be made against the Clare Co. Council.  The members of the Co. Council are hardly children, and they are aware that the Land Commission cannot deduct rates which the Co. Council are unable to prove are due. The Co. Council have refused to sue Mr. McNamara for the rates.  If they sue him and get a decree, then the Land Commission can act.  The Co. Council know that quite well. 
     
     
      
       Does the Land Commission know that a person must be in immediate enjoyment of the place in order to be in a position to be sued for the rates?  Has the Minister considered the desirability of dealing in his forthcoming Land Bill with such cases? 
     
     
      
       That is new law as far as I am aware. 
     
     
      
       Look it up. 
     
   
   
     COMMITTEE OF SELECTION. - TWENTIETH REPORT. 
     
     
      
       I beg to submit the Twentieth Report of the Committee of Selection:&mdash; 
       The Committee of Selection met on Tuesday, 16th November, 1926. 
       The Committee nominated the following Deputies to serve on the Select Committee on the Land Bill (No. 2), 1926, viz.: The Minister for Lands and Agriculture, Deputies Roddy, Noonan, Dwyer, James Cosgrave, Heffernan, Gorey, P. Hogan (Clare), and T.J. Murphy. 
       Ordered: &ldquo;That the Report do lie upon the Table.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Am I in order in making a comment on this? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       I must protest against the decision of the Committee of Selection in this matter.  I agreed to refer this Bill to a Committee of Selection for the purpose of giving certain people an opportunity of moving amendments which would not be in order otherwise. Now what has happened?  The Committee of Selection has met, and I would have thought that it was the function of the Committee to give proportional representation to the various parties in the Dail, but instead they have given a representation of four to a party of about sixty, and a representation of five to the other parties of about fortyfour&mdash;all the other parties would amount to about forty-four.  I think that is a regrettable incident, and I think it is a very serious question for the Committee to come to such a decision. I must say that I cannot see the justification for it.  To my mind it will reduce the procedure of the Committee of Selection to a farce. 
     
     It is, of course, open to me to come back to the Dail, and to ask the Dail to consider amendments, but I do not want to do that.  I want to meet all the parties and to discuss the amendments with them on the merits.  I am faced now with a position where the Government Party, amounting to between   55 and 64, is in a minority on that Committee.  I always thought that the functions of that Committee were to give proportional representation to all parties.  This is not the first time this Committee will have to function. There will be other matters referred to the Committee of Selection.  This is a serious precedent for them to make and, obviously, if this is to be taken as a precedent, I do not see how the Government, in important matters such as this question of the Land Act, involving extremely weighty financial considerations, is to act.  If this is the way the Committee of Selection is performing their functions&mdash;I have not consulted any member of the Government about it&mdash;I must say that I imagine the Government Party will have to review their whole attitude towards the Committee of Selection, and if they do it might destroy the usefulness of the Committee itself. 
     I do not want to press this to a division; unless I have the general consent of the whole Dail, I do not want even to move an amendment to it. But I do suggest that the proper thing to do in this case, having regard to all the circumstances, and having regard to the financial importance of the Bill, is, if I get general agreement on the matter from the House, to move that it be referred back to the Committee of Selection for reconsideration. 
     
      
       I think if anybody is at fault in this matter it is the representative of the Government Party. The Committee of Selection met yesterday evening and the representatives of the Government on the Committee seemed to me to be in charge of a Professor&mdash;Professor Tierney. 
     
     
      
       They were in charge of a Deputy. 
     
     
      
       A Deputy Professor. 
     
     
      
       He is not a Deputy Professor. 
     
     
      
       I did not know that there was that good reason. 
     
     
      
       The matter was under consideration and the Chairman asked the Government Party representative   how many did they want and Deputy Professor Tierney answered that they wanted five.  I think I said we would like to get three, and Deputy Johnson said he would expect two, and the Independents wanted one.  We were trying to make provision also for the People's Party.  I do not know if anybody yet knows what is the real strength of the Government Party. 
     
     
      
       You have good reason to know it often. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Professor Tierney said &ldquo;we will take off one and let them take off one also.&rdquo;  We agreed, and we were the happiest family in the world last night.  We put on the Committee the members of the Government Party that we thought were the best men for the job.  As a matter of fact, I think I proposed all the names myself.  We were in perfect agreement about this.  The question did not arise, and if anyone is at fault it is the representative of the Government.  There was no intention of doing anything wrong. 
     
     
      
       I would like to support what Deputy Gorey has said in regard to the proceedings of the Committee.  The Government representatives, so far as I understood the matter, were prepared to agree to the Committee as now formed.  That being so, I do not know whether it is up to the Minister to complain now of the action of the Selection Committee when representatives of his own party agreed&mdash;this was a unanimous report&mdash; to the Committee being composed as it is now.  As regards meeting all parties, as the Minister suggests, I think he would find a little difficulty on a Committee of nine members in meeting all parties.  The method in which the members have been allocated seemed to the members of the Selection Committee to be the fairest under the circumstances. As Deputy Gorey has said, there is one party which has no representative on the Committee. 
     
     
      
       How many parties are in the House? 
     
     
      
       That is the point.  I think it is difficult for the   Minister to meet all parties as he suggests. The nearest that we could go to bring about that state of affairs was to make the selection we did.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the Committee as a whole, including the Government's representatives.  It was thought at the Committee that this matter of the Land Bill was a question in regard to which hard and fast party lines could really be waived.  The Land Bill is a great Bill for the benefit, I presume, of the supporters of all parties.  It was thought that on a measure such as this, hard, fast and narrow party distinctions should not be drawn.  At any rate, the Selection Committee made their choice, and I strongly support Deputy Gorey when he says that if the Minister has any complaint it is against the members of his own party who are on the Selection Committee. 
     
     
      
       I was under the impression that I had the distinction of being a member of the Selection Committee, but I now learn for the first time that that Committee met last night and selected a Committee to deal with the Land Bill. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is certainly a member of the Selection Committee. 
     
     
      
       If Deputy Magennis is a member of the Selection Committee why was he not notified of the meeting? 
     
     
      
       I think Deputy Magennis will be able to make that point clear. 
     
     
      
       The point is, if the Deputy is a member of the Committee, why was he not notified about yesterday's meeting? 
     
     
      
       The Deputy can make his mind perfectly clear about Deputy Magennis's capacity to argue his own case. 
     
     
      
       I do not agree that because certain Deputies in the Government Party agreed to this, that necessarily ends it.  I did not think that that was the way in which Deputies would face the matter.  I thought it was the business of the Selection Committee   and of each and every member, not only members of the Government Party but members of other parties, to give proportional representation to each party.  Undoubtedly that has not been done in this case, and I protest against what has occurred.  The Government Party, with a clear majority, are left in a minority on the Committee. I have not been treated fairly.  I could have adopted another mode of procedure. I could have taken the Bill in Second Reading in the ordinary way and, without indicating what other parties might or might not do in Committee, I have little doubt that I would have carried the Bill.  In order, however, to meet other parties I suggested that amendments be brought up, but it was found that these amendments were not in order and this Committee was suggested to give Deputies an opportunity of bringing them up and of giving the Dail an opportunity of discussing the amendments.  The Selection Committee has met and has put the Government Party, who have a majority, in a minority on the Committee. 
     
     
      
       I protest.  First of all we were met with the difficulty as regards numbers.  In selecting a Committee of nine we could not have treated the different parties in proportion. Had the figure been different to nine we might have been able to work it out differently.  I think the view was held that the findings of the Committee were to be reported to the Dail and that the Dail would decide the matter. 
     
     
      
       That is begging the question. 
     
     
      
       There was no intention to go outside the ordinary terms, which I always insisted on and which I had occasion to insist on, and I want no implication cast on any members of the Committee either at the meeting last night or at any other time.  I do not know what the Minister intends. There is nothing final in the findings in this case.  The report will not have the effect of an Act.  I do not think that it is any undue hardship on the Minister. No party interested in this measure, such as my party, could scarcely claim that they would be adequately represented   by having one member on the Committee.  If the Minister got what he wanted it would mean that there would be one representative from the Farmers' Party, one from the Labour Party, and one from the Independent Party.  Owing to the number required to form the Committee we could not work out the representation proportionately. 
     
     
      
       I take it that the Minister really wants to pass a vote of censure on the Selection Committee for not obeying Standing Orders.  His own party had a majority on the Committee last night. 
     
     
      
       Had a majority last night? 
     
     
      
       Yes, to make the selection. 
     
     
      
       Might I ask is that the only time they had a majority? 
     
     
      
       At the Committee which made the selection. 
     
     
      
       We always had to send for Government members on this Committee. They have been the worst attendants at the Committee, and in order to give them representation we had to send for them time and again to attend the Committee. 
     
     
      
       This Committee, presumably, was called last night at very short notice.  I do not know who received notice or who did not.  It happened that the regular Chairman was not present, and I was asked to take the Chair.  The supporters of the Government had a majority present. The selection was made as near as possible to the Standing Order, which said that the Committee was to be as nearly representative as possible according to the Parties in the Dail.  Perhaps the Minister will mobilise the mathematicians the next time the Committee meets and work out the proper proportion for parties, so that we could have a man and a boy for one party and a mixture of two or three boys for another party.  The Minister wants the exact mathematical proportion applied to the Government Party and to have   any other proportion applied to other parties. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps the Deputy would read the Standing Order? 
     
     
      
       &ldquo;The Committee shall be otherwise constituted according to the provisions of Standing Orders Nos. 67 and 68, and so as to be impartially representative of the Dail.&rdquo; That has been done, and it is for the Minister to challenge by vote of the House as to whether the Committee of Selection has chosen this Committee impartially or otherwise.  So far as I am concerned, the Committee did its work very satisfactorily and in accordance with Standing Orders.  I am sure that the representation of the Government Party on the Committee is worth more than a numerical majority, considering the Minister himself is a member of it. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Johnson's idea of a Committee impartially representative of the Dail is that a party of sixty should have a representation of four members, and that other parties with forty-four or forty-five members should have a representation of five. 
     
     
      
       There was some haste with regard to the summoning of the Selection Committee. I understand it was summoned yesterday evening by the process of handing notices to Deputies as they left the House.  The meeting was held after the House adjourned.  Deputy Magennis did not get a notice as he left. 
     
     That, of course, was wrong.  The Selection Committee is not bound to appoint Committees impartially representative of the Dail.  The Standing Order which Deputy Johnson has quoted, and which the Minister for Lands and Agriculture has accepted, deals with the appointment of the Committee of Selection itself.  New Standing Order 70 says: &ldquo;...The Committee shall be otherwise constituted according to the provisions of Standing Orders Nos. 67 and 68, and so as to be impartially representative of the Dail.&rdquo; An obligation, of course, rests on the Selection Committee to do its best under the circumstances.  I would like   to say that the utility of a Selection Committee in our procedure would be destroyed if the Selection Committee proceeded so that when there was a majority of one party the outcome of the Committee's work would be a particular result, and when there was a majority of another party there would be another result.  That is not the intention, and has not been the practice. Notwithstanding the difficulty of the Minister at the moment, apparently that did not happen last night, because the Committee appears to have been unanimous.  Although it is not obliged to choose a Committee in a particular way, still, the practice is that it endeavours to choose it so as to give representation to all parties.  On occasions when parties are divided, as they were, for example, on a Private Members' Bill dealing with shop hours, the Committee of Selection appoints members in the way that seems best in the circumstances, but I think, always by way of unanimous report.  In this instance, the Committee having been unanimous, I do not see a way out except to take the Committee that is suggested. There is this practical difficulty, that if a Government measure is referred to a Committee, and if the Government is in a majority in the House &mdash;I speak not of this Government but of Governments in general&mdash;and if the Committee does not have a majority in that particular way, it is likely to have the result that the decisions of the Committee will be reversed by the House, thus making the proceedings of the Committee, to a certain extent, a waste of time.  I see no way of getting over the difficulty unless the Committee of Selection reconsiders its decision, or unless the Select Committee were increased in numbers, say, to eleven. If the Minister is not pressing the point, the matter stands.  The only way I see is to increase the numbers, if it is desired to do so. 
     
      
       We would have done that cheerfully last night if we knew anything about it.  Members of the Committee who do not belong to the Government Party are often in a difficulty, as they do not know who does and who does not belong to the Government   Party.  Two or three slices have fallen off the Government Party. We did not know who they were, and we did not like to be too inquisitive. Deputy Johnson did not know the extent of the slices that fell away in 1923, 1925 or 1926.  We were in this difficulty, that we did not know where we were. 
     
     
      
       One admires Deputy Gorey's delicacy.  The only way we can deal with the matter is to let the report stand or increase the numbers of the Select Committee. 
     
     
      
       If the Minister wants another member we will agree. 
     
     
      
       I suggest that the number be increased.  I would like to refer to the statement Deputy Gorey made, as I have a particular care in the matter. The point was made, that at the meeting of the Committee there were four members of the Government Party present out of a possible five, one being ill, out of a total representation of eight. 
     
     
      
       In the circumstances, I think as there does not seem to be general agreement I have no objection to let the report stand. 
     
     
      
       The report will lie on the Table. 
     
   
   
     COMMITTEE OF SELECTION. - WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY BILL, 1926.&mdash;FIRST STAGE. 
     
      
       I ask leave to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make provision for the regulation and control of wireless telegraphy on land, at sea, and in the air, and for the regulation and control of certain classes of visual and sound signalling stations, and for the establishment and maintenance of the State broadcasting stations, and to provide for other matters relating to wireless telegraphy, signalling and broadcasting respectively. 
       Leave given to introduce Bill. 
       Bill read a First Time. 
       Ordered&mdash;That the Second Stage be taken on Wednesday, November 24th. 
     
   
   
     PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS. - TOWN TENANTS BILL, 1926.&mdash;FIRST STAGE. 
     
     
      
       The next item on the Orders of the Day is a Bill introduced by a Private Member.  The procedure we intend to adopt is to put down the First Stage of Private Members' business in this way, at the beginning of the Orders of the Day, if it is not opposed.  If such Bills are opposed the debate, if there be debate, will take place in the time allotted by the Standing Orders for Private Members' business. I would like to ask is this Bill being opposed? 
     
     
      
       To this extent: that I cannot give any earlier time for the Second Reading before two months hence.  To that extent only do I oppose it. 
     
     
      
       If the Bill was given a First Reading it could be printed and circulated, and could be put down for Second Reading during the time allotted to Private Members&mdash; not in Government time.  The President need not give Government time then. 
     
     
      
       I am afraid I would have to move the adjournment for this reason, that I would not be in a position to deal with it for two months. 
     
     
      
       Are we to understand from what the President has said that it is the intention of the Government to take up Private Members' time during the next two months? 
     
     
      
       As far as a Bill such as this is concerned, yes.  I expect that it is intended that the Government should deal with this as a Private Members' Bill.  This Bill is one that has been under consideration, or rather has been the subject matter of consideration, by the Minister for Justice for some time past.  I do not anticipate that the Minister will be able to deal with it within two months.  To that extent the Government will have to oppose taking up the time of the House on this particular Bill. 
     
     
     
      
       Do I understand from the President's remarks that he opposes the First Reading of the Bill now? 
     
     
      
       I have not said so. 
     
     
      
       The question was put from the Chair, and I would like to know the reply. 
     
     
      
       The First Reading is not being opposed. 
     
     
      
       I ask the leave of the Dail to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to improve the position of tenants of certain houses, shops arid other buildings in Saorstat Eireann. 
       At this stage I do not intend to occupy the time of the House, as I am not strictly entitled to go into details regarding this measure.  The object of the Bill is to remedy existing and glaring grievances that tenants in towns and villages in the Saorstat are now suffering under.  I trust that the basis upon which these remedies will be dealt with will appeal to Deputies, generally, as a fair and equitable one, as between landlords and tenants.  I look forward, confidently, to the measure receiving support from all quarters of the House.  I do not know whether I am entitled, at this stage, to say anything about the date of the Second Reading. 
     
     
      
       No, until the First Reading is approved. 
     
     
      
       Very well.  I have no more to say upon the subject-matter of the Bill, except that it is well known and present in the minds of Deputies in this House.  I trust the measure I am proposing will be considered as a fair, just and moderate means of bringing about reform much and badly needed in many quarters. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That leave be given to introduce the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       What is Deputy Redmond's suggestion with regard to the Second Stage? 
     
     
     
      
       On the matter of the Second Stage I understood the President to say he would not be prepared to give Private Members' time for the discussion of this Bill.  Well, I understood that Private Members' time was their own time and not in the hands of any party, Government or otherwise, in this House, and that when Private Bills or other measures are proposed, or motions made by Private Members, they should come up for consideration in due course of order on occasions allotted to Private Members. Of course the President may, with the assistance of his majority in this House, be able to take up the whole of the time of Private Members for the next two months.  But I say, with all respect and seriousness, that although he may be entitled to do that, which is a very far-fetched thing to do, he is not entitled, whether as leader of the Government or anything else, to discriminate between one Private Member and another in the matter of what business shall be taken in Private Members' time.  I would like, therefore, to know from the President what are his intentions in this matter? 
     
     
      
       The ordinary procedure is this: The Bill has now been introduced; it will be printed and circulated, and a date must be fixed for Second Reading.  In order that the matter will come properly before the House, it would be correct, I think, for Deputy Redmond to name a date.  It is the practice, when a Deputy introduces a Bill and the introduction has been passed by the House, that a motion is put for the purpose of making an order fixing the date of Second Reading.  Then we can hear what the point is.  Private Members' time, of course, belongs to Private Members, with the proviso, under the Standing Orders, that at the beginning of the day in which Private Members would ordinarily have time a Minister may move to take the whole time of that particular day.  To put this matter in order, will Deputy Redmond suggest a date for the Second Reading? 
     
     
      
       In accordance with the ruling of the Chair, I suggest this day week. 
     
     
     
      
       I have to oppose any earlier date than the 19th of January for the reasons I have given. A measure such as this was introduced some time ago and was beaten on Second Reading.  A measure was introduced by the Minister for Justice some time this year dealing with the same subject, to some extent, and now we have a third measure introduced on the same subject.  I am not in a position to deal with the Bill, nor is the Department concerned, at an earlier date than the 19th of January. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Redmond moves: &ldquo;That the Second Reading be taken on the 24th of November,&rdquo; and the President moves an amendment &ldquo;To delete the words `twenty-fourth of November' and substitute instead thereof the words `nineteenth of January.' &rdquo; 
     
     
      
       It astonishes me to hear the President take this course. Quite apart from the grave discourtesy to Private Members of the House, to say that a Bill which has had a First Reading and which is entitled to be considered on the Second Reading, should be postponed by a motion is in effect a refusal to receive the Bill.  The President says two months instead of six which is the practice in other places for moving the rejection of a Bill. 
     
     
      
       It is a very early date after resumption. 
     
     
      
       Surely we can discuss the principle of the Bill after the decision of the House that it is desirable that the Bill should be circulated. 
     
     
      
       The Bill is not circulated yet. 
     
     
      
       No, and it will have to get a Second Reading before it will be considered in Committee.  Surely it is due to any Private Member who takes advantage of his rights, according to the Standing Orders, to introduce a Private Bill, that he should have the opportunity for a Second Reading discussion once sanction is given for the Bill to be printed.  If that is to be denied, then I take it to be a challenge   to the House to refuse any facilities to Government measures as far as they can.  I think that is entirely unfair to Private Members, quite part from the question that it is known by the public statement of Ministers that the proposition contained in the Bill has been receiving consideration.  To say that it cannot now be considered on the Minister's part for another two months is to say that it has taken a longer time for them to consider this matter than it takes them to consider many more important and involved questions.  We had it from the Minister for Finance recently that this matter was under the consideration of the Ministry, and I presume they know their minds on the principle.  We ought to know whether it is the intention of the Government to allow a Bill of this nature to have a Second Reading discussion, at the ordinary time that would be taken by Private Members, once it has got a First Reading.  I think it is very necessary that every Deputy should stand for the rights of Private Deputies and support the proposition that next Wednesday be the date fixed for the Second Reading of this Bill. 
     
     
      
       I should like also to express the opinion that I disapprove of the attitude of the President and the tactics of the Government in this matter. This is not the only occasion on which the Government have tried to appropriate Private Members' time. They have done so on several occasions before.  We had the Public Safety Bill yesterday and notice of its Second Reading for to-day, but this Bill, which is absolutely necessary to help thousands of citizens in the Saorstat, is to be denied facilities because we are told the Government have not had time to consider it.  I think it is more or less an insult to Private Members of this House when they introduce Private Bills to be told that they cannot have a Second Reading for two months. Surely if the speeches that the Government have been making throughout the country are to be regarded as indications of their views towards the town tenants it is opportune to allow this Bill to come up for   Second Reading on Wednesday next. They should do their best to facilitate this Bill becoming law.  Members of all parties&mdash;Cumann na nGaedheal, Independents, Labour Party or Farmers&mdash;should support the promoters of this Bill and vote against the Government's attitude. 
     
     
      
       I do not know whether I am entitled to speak again. 
     
     
      
       Yes.  The Deputy can speak upon the amendment to make the date of the Second Reading the nineteenth of January. 
     
     
      
       With your permission, therefore, sir, I desire to say I fail to understand the attitude of mind of the President when a Bill proposed by a Private Member is introduced, is allowed to pass its First Stage, and then he should propose an amendment providing that the Second Stage shall not be taken for two months.  Does that mean that all Private Members' business is to be held over for two months or not?  If it does mean that all Private Members' business is to be taken away&mdash;all the privileges enjoyed by Private Members for discussing motions, Bills or proposals made or brought forward&mdash;in the next two months, then we know where we are. That is one method of doing it.  I do not think it is altogether a straight method. If it does not mean that, and if it means that only one Private Member is to be deprived of his right of introducing a Bill because that Bill does not happen to be one of which the President approves&mdash;he does not know what is in the Bill yet&mdash;and because it is a Bill the subject of which is not altogether favourable or pleasant for the Government&mdash;and because of that, that Private Member is to be penalised and is to be swamped by the Government majority in this House from exercising his right as a Private Member of the Dail&mdash;then I say it is time the public knew about it, and it is time that we gave up the farce of having any discussion here at all or having time allotted to anyone but the Government to say anything or do anything on the part of the State. 
     
     
      
       Appoint a dictator. 
     
     
     
      
       If there was a dictator appointed it would be above board&mdash;we would know where we were.  But here we have a proposal which, in effect, may be in the first place a method to prevent all Private Members from having any Private Members' discussion, or, in the second place, may be to deprive one Private Member of exercising his rights as a Private Member. I say that the President cannot get away from either of these alternatives, and I further say that if those are the alternatives it is a course which any leader of any democratic Government in any country in the world should be ashamed of. 
     
     
      
       In view of some of the statements made by Deputy Redmond, I think it is only right that I should, at least, get an opportunity of explaining that the exaggerated statements he has made are not in the least benefiting his case.  There is a great difference between the Dail and a platform outside; one may exaggerate there if one wishes.  The position with regard to this matter is quite simple.  The Minister who has charge of this question of rent restriction and so on, which concerns town tenants, is in London. He has been in London for a month&mdash;I am sure Deputy Redmond knows that. It may be with Deputy Redmond's displeasure he is there, but he is there. 
     
     
      
       How long will he be there? 
     
     
      
       I cannot say&mdash; certainly for a week.  I intimated to Deputy Redmond, when I was saying that I had no objection to the First Reading, that it would depend on the date of the Second Reading.  Accommodation is a thing that has been given to everybody in this House, in spite of what Deputy Redmond has said.  Everybody tries to meet everybody else.  Was Deputy Redmond trying to meet me when he said a week from now, while the Minister dealing with this matter is in London? 
     
     
      
       If I might interrupt the President, before I mentioned any date at all the President   stated categorically that he would not take it before two months. 
     
     
      
       Certainly not this day week.  If I was to do what, the Deputy would like me to do, to beat it, I could do it.  I am not playacting about this matter.  There may be people who wish to see me in that position.  I want to treat it seriously; I can treat it seriously in two months.  I do not know whether we will be sitting here on the 17th December, a month hence.  When the Minister for Justice returns, considerable arrears of work and business will have to be dealt with.  The Deputy knows that, and knowing that I could not possibly take it, he put it down for a week hence, for one purpose only&mdash; in order to make the exaggerated speech he has made.  We have not adopted those methods in dealing with the business here; we have endeavoured in every way possible to meet Deputies.  As I have said, the Deputy has already brought in one Bill dealing with this subject in this Session and it has been beaten.  The Minister for Justice brought in another Bill, which does not run out for two years, dealing with rent restriction. The subject is not as urgent as other Government measures and business we have to deal with, and I do not think it is unreasonable to mention in respect to this matter that I will not be in a position to deal with it until we return after the Recess. 
     
     
      
       I regret that the President has taken up this attitude on this matter, because it is a very important matter to a very large number of citizens.  I cannot see the point of the President's argument about a Bill being introduced early in 1924 and being defeated, and I cannot see the point in his argument about the Rent Restriction Act passed in June last.  It was the passage of that very Act that made it so necessary that a Town Tenants Bill should be introduced, because there is no security, and there will be no security, for the town tenants when that Act becomes fully operative, and the President knows that. 
     
     
      
       I did not hear   what the Deputy said, but if he means that the Rent Restriction Act does not give security after 1929&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       After 1929 it removes security. 
     
     
      
       There are two years of secured time.  I am asking for two months as against two years. 
     
     
      
       I am not trying to make any unfair points.  The point I am making in connection with the Rent Restriction Act is that it was the passage of that Act, together with the statement made by the Minister for Justice on the Second Reading, that the Government was satisfied that the time had arrived when rent restrictions were no longer necessary, which has created uneasiness in the minds of town tenants and made it necessary to have this Town Tenants Bill discussed.  I may further say that the Government themselves gave a promise two years ago that they were considering the question of introducing a Town Tenants Bill.  The President may recollect&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       If my recollection is correct, we did the same about the Army Pensions Bill. 
     
     
      
       I hope for the sake of the town tenants and of the Government that the Government are a little more serious about the Town Tenants Bill than about the Army Pensions Bill. 
     
     
      
       That is not a fair statement&mdash;the Deputy knows we were serious. 
     
     
      
       If the Government do deal with the town tenants question, two years will have elapsed from the time they started to deal with it until they get a First Reading for the Bill&mdash;if they are going to introduce a Bill&mdash;just as happened in the case of the Army Pensions Bill.  There may be some point in the question of the absence of the Minister for Justice.  I may be prepared to concede that it would be, perhaps, necessary to have the Minister for Justice here, but on the Second Reading we will not be dealing with details, only with the principle of the Bill.  I, therefore, submit,   with all respect to the Minister for Justice, that the President is as well qualified to deal with the question of town tenants as any other member of the Government.  Perhaps the President knows a good deal more about the problem than any other Minister. I do not see any reason why the Second Reading could not be taken, as the President could deal with it himself. I submit, further, that the question is as much one for the President to deal with as it is for the Minister for Justice. 
     
     
      
       I have not his Department. 
     
     
      
       The President will get the same information.  I would urge the President not to deal with the matter in this way. 
     
     
      
       There is a lot of difference between knowledge of a subject and its solution. 
     
     
      
       The President has not in his reply answered a very pertinent question put to him by Deputy Redmond, as to whether or not it is the intention of the Government during the remainder of this portion of the session to take Private Members' time.  If that is not the intention, then will the President indicate to the House whether he is to be the censor of the kind of business that Private Members are to bring forward during the time set aside for Private Members? 
     
     
      
       There is no necessity for exaggeration at all. 
     
     
      
       The President, when he comes to reply, will, I hope, give some indication as to what the attitude of the Ministry is on the rights of Private Members.  The President, in the beginning of the discussion, when opposing the Second Reading Stage being taken before the 19th January, said it was a Departmental matter.  Therefore, I suggest, and I think Deputy Morrissey was right in making the same suggestion, that if it is purely a Departmental matter, it is not so much a question for the Minister for Justice himself as for the officials of his Department, who would, I take it, be instructed to investigate   the terms of the Bill.  The real point, however, is this, that the President, no more than any other member of the House, has not, I am sure, seen a copy of the measure.  That being so, he is not, I take it, in a position to determine whether it is a matter of policy or detailed administration that is affected.  If the Government intends, as it may be taken they do from the President's statement, to take all Private Members' time between this and the 19th of January, I think it was the business of the President yesterday to move a motion on those lines.  I would be surprised, however, to hear from the President that there is sufficient business to occupy the House for five days a week between now and the 19th of January.  If there is not, then why should the Government take up the time of Private Members&mdash;time that might be usefully occupied in dealing with a measure of this kind. 
     
     
      
       This thing has really got far beyond the bounds of proper discussion on the amendment the President has down. There has been no question, and there is no question, of an attempt upon the time ordinarily allotted to Private Members. There has been the very definite statement made by the President that if Deputy Redmond intends to avail himself of his rights in putting this thing down, it may possibly be the President's duty to do all he can to mass his forces in order to ensure Deputy Redmond defat upon this measure. 
     
     
      
       Why defeat? 
     
     
      
       I have said it may be necessary and that is all.  This question that Deputy Redmond is interested in is a question that a great many other people are interested in. It is a question that has been under consideration, and details have been gone into.  These details have carried the Departments concerned much further than ever was thought.  I do not agree with the well-known complex which Deputy Davin has, that officials do everything in Departments. 
     
     
     
      
       The President said so. 
     
     
      
       The President said that this Bill could not be proceeded with at the present moment, and he gave his reasons for it&mdash;that the Minister concerned with measures of a like kind coming from Government sources was in London. 
     
     
      
       The President said at the beginning that the Departmental work of the Minister for Justice was in arrears.  I take it that this is purely a matter of going into the administrative effects of the measure. 
     
     
      
       No.  The President referred to the absence of the Minister for Justice in London, and said that when he came back he would have certain arrears of Departmental matters to deal with.  Deputy Davin's complex comes in here again.  He evidently thinks that there cannot be any Departmental details that a Minister ever has to look after&mdash;that it is only the duty of officials to do that.  There is going to be accommodation on this matter as far as possible, but let us wipe out of consideration all talk and all thought about the seizure of Private Members' time.  There is no question of seizing Private Members' time; there is no question even of trying to deprive Deputy Redmond of time, but there is a very definite statement by the President that if Deputy Redmond comes forward with this Bill on this day week, then certainly in the interval, the Minister for Justice, who would ordinarily be the man to direct his Department to make an investigation of what Deputy Redmond's Bill contains, being in London, could not deal with the matter himself.  Deputy Morrissey has spoken of the uneasiness and the absence of security.  It is quite clear, I am sure, that a Town Tenants Bill, described in the way it is here, will include a great many other matters than what are in the Rent Restrictions Act. One obviously does not go as far as the other, but on the question of uneasiness or insecurity, has not the Rent Restrictions Act gone far to remove that uneasiness or feeling of insecurity? What has been asked for in the interval of two years?  At least some definite   security has been given, and there is asked remission of two months so that Deputy Redmond's Bill may be collated with whatever the Department's proposals are.  An attempt is to be made to get not merely accommodation for discussion, but possibly accommodation on the measure itself, and that is really what has been asked for. I heard Deputy Johnson remark to his colleagues that it is only the principle that is dealt with on Second Reading, but, I ask, does the principle not depend upon the details?  Have the details not to be considered before one can come to a conclusion upon the principle put forward in the Second Reading of a Bill? 
     
     
      
       It depends on what is in the Bill. 
     
     
      
       Can the Deputy imagine a Bill of the Town Tenants type where the decision on the principle of the Second Reading will not depend to a considerable extent upon the details?   Now, taking that seriously, the details are all-important in this thing, and although there may be what we may call a Second Reading speech and what we may call the principle of the measure to be discussed, it is the details that will count, and it is on the details that the decision will be given.  Deputy Redmond has already brought forward a Bill which has been beaten.  I am not exactly sure how we stand with regard to the proposed Bill, but I understand there is a Standing Order which states that if a Bill is defeated it cannot be reintroduced&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I would like to ask the Minister whether he has seen this Bill of mine? 
     
     
      
       I have seen the title of this Bill. 
     
     
      
       But have you seen the Bill? 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       Then why not wait and see? 
     
     
      
       I am simply indicating a difficulty.  It may not be a   serious difficulty and it may be one that can be met.  I seem to remember, however, that there is a Standing Order which says that if a Bill is introduced and defeated it cannot be introduced again. 
     
     
      
       Who said this is the same Bill? 
     
     
      
       I have not even said that it is the same Bill. 
     
     
      
       Let us hear this argument. 
     
     
      
       A Bill introduced and defeated cannot be introduced in the same session again. 
     
     
      
       When did the session begin? 
     
     
      
       I do not know if anybody has yet decided what a session is, but as far as I have been able to see from various reports that have come to me, the position is something like this.  I have seen a definition, I think, given as a sub-title to the Parliamentary Reports of the Official Debates. It refers to debates having taken place as between certain dates and some dates in July, 1926, and further there is a reference to the debates of a session which started in September, 1923, so that presumably we are still in the same session. 
     
     
      
       Then the Allotments Bill is out of order. 
     
     
      
       That may be a point for the Deputy to raise afterwards, when he can get a decision from the Ceann Comhairle. 
     
     
      
       On a point of order, may I ask whether the Minister has a right to question the Order introducing a Bill which he has not seen and which nobody in this House has seen yet except the proposer? 
     
     
      
       A Bill the First Reading of which he himself has supported. 
     
     
      
       My vote for the First Reading of the measure would not validate something which might afterwards be ruled as invalid.  I   gather now that the Bill is definitely in order.  Deputy Morrissey I think it was who spoke of the absence of the Minister for Justice.  He said that the President was quite as well qualified to deal with this measure as anybody else and that he was better qualified than the Minister for Justice.  To that the President made reply&mdash;I do not know how far the Deputy understood the implication of his statement&mdash;that he has not a Department to look after it, and that he is not going to give instructions to the Department of the Minister for Justice in the absence of that Minister. 
     
     
      
       Did not the President introduce the Housing Act of 1926 even though he had no Department? 
     
     
      
       May I say that while I may not be mentally so agile as the Minister I perfectly understand the implications of what the President has said? 
     
     
      
       The fact of the matter is that in so far as it is a Departmental measure and has any reactions on any Department, it is the Department of the Minister for Justice that is concerned.  The Minister for Justice is in London on very important business, and from my knowledge of what is happening in London I do not see any possibility of his being here this day week.  The President has asked for accommodation.  He indicated to Deputy Captain Redmond that the bringing forward of a measure of this kind for discussion about this time was not a thing we would like.  The Deputy, instead of looking for what accommodation he could get, proceeds to bring forward his measure.  There has been a counter amendment by the President to postpone this matter for two months.  If that is considered a very serious delay, if there is going to be anything done in two months' time which is going adversely to affect those who are intended to benefit under the Town Tenants Bill, then let that be put to us and time will be made available for discussion; but in fairness to the Department concerned, some consideration should be given to the fact that the Minister for Justice has been away   from his Department and will not be back for some time.  Even before the Minister went to London a considerable amount of his time had been taken up preparing for the Conference, and it is not fair to bring in a Bill having reactions on the Minister's Department at this time.  If it is to be fought out, and we are to have this amendment pressed, it will only mean having a conflict here now which we will have to fight out again this day week, and which may not result any way beneficially to those Deputy Redmond wants to assist.  It is only reasonable under the circumstances to ask for the postponement of a measure of this importance, and I will ask Deputy Captain Redmond to reconsider his proposal to have his measure brought forward for Second Reading this day week. 
     
     
      
       I share in a great measure the view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I and the other members of the party on these benches take the position of onlookers in regard to this matter.  We have been looking at the three different starters for the town tenants' stakes with a certain degree of amusement. We know that this is not a new matter. These parties have been working in the interests of the town tenants with a view to the coming election.  We are not so much interested in this. 
     
     
      
       I should think so. 
     
     
      
       I mean we are not so much interested in getting votes here and there and making political capital out of the whole scramble.  Here is a scramble between the three starters for the stakes to see which is going to get away from the tapes first, without any consideration for the people primarily interested in this question, that is, the town tenants themselves.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has said that not alone can there be accommodation as regards dates but in the matter itself, and I think that suggestion is entitled to very deep consideration by everybody concerned if they want to act in the best interests of the town tenants.  I think we are animated   with the motive of doing the best for them, and I think that will be done by agreeing to the suggestion that has been made.  I can see the reasonableness of the Minister's attitude.  The Minister most interested in this had his time taken up with other matters before he went to the Conference, which he is still attending, and his Department could not give the attention to this matter that it deserves.  I think the two months' period may seem long, and perhaps an earlier date can be arranged.  I appeal not to have the proposal that the Second Reading of this measure should be taken this day week pressed to a division.  I think this day week is an unreasonable date, and this day two months also unreasonable. 
     
     
      
       Unlike Deputy Gorey, I think the Government are very unreasonable in this matter.  I think it is very unreasonable for the Minister to suggest that Private Members' rights should be taken from them, and that is what he is asking. 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       That is my view-point. I consider that Deputy Captain Redmond has a perfect right to have the Second Reading this day week.  In order to remove the impression that has certainly been created in this matter I think the Government should at least see that the Bill will have its Second Reading on this day week, or possibly this day fortnight, and there would be the possibility of better accommodation by the Government and the House on the whole.  When the Government see the measure they could, if they so desire, move the adjournment of the Second Reading to a later date.  Deputy Captain Redmond could, I think, be induced to have a Second Reading this day fortnight.  That is reasonable, but I suggest it is unreasonable for the Minister to postpone it to what I consider to be an indiscriminate date.  I listened to Deputy Gorey talking about the amusement with which he heard the people who had spoken on this Bill.  He said that the matter was of no interest as far as he was concerned. 
     
     
      
       I said nothing of the   sort.  I said the matter of getting votes has no interest for us. 
     
     
      
       Read the Official Report. That is how it appears to me.  If the town tenants had looked on the Land League with the same amusement as the Deputy tells us he looks on this the farmers would not be as well off as they are to-day. 
     
     
      
       I said nothing of the sort. 
     
     
      
       I am sure we will have this matter of the farmers and the town tenants threshed out on the Second Reading. 
     
     
      
       I think so.  The Deputy may tell the truth even then. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Gorey may have spoken the truth unconsciously. 
     
     
      
       I would like to remove a few impressions that seem to have got abroad on this matter.  From the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and from the last utterance of the President, one would be inclined to gather that I had been approached and that it had been indicated to me that I might be asked to give some accommodation.  I want to let it be known here and now that I was never approached, and that the only thing in the nature of an indication of anything as regards accommodation was a flat, categorical statement by the President that he would not have this measure taken for Second Reading before two months.  Is that asking me for accommodation?  If I had been asked by the President, in view of the fact that the Vice-President is in London&mdash;and he would have his sneer that I did not like him to be there, but I do not know how he thinks that, as I can assure him that the fact is very much to the contrary&mdash;to postpone the Second Reading of this Bill for a reasonable time.  I can assure the President and the Minister I would have taken the matter in a very different spirit.  But that was not the way it was put to me.  On the contrary, it was stated here by the leader of the Government that this Bill would   not have a Second Reading before two months, and it was only when the second speech was made by the President&mdash;I do not like exactly to make the allegation, but it did seem to me somewhat of a little  arriere pensee &mdash; that he said: &ldquo;The Vice-President will be in London, and of course that is the reason that the Bill must be postponed for two months.&rdquo; 
       Let us come down to what the Government are asking now.  It appears now, from their two spokesmen, that they have recognised the right of a Private Member to have a Second Reading for his Bill.  I have no reason to demand that the Second Reading should be taken this day week.  It was in deference to your own suggestion, sir, that I had named a day.  I had not mentioned a date.  It is the custom to name a date and I was asked to name a date in order to have a discussion take place.  I named the next Private Members' day&mdash;this day week.  I say that was a most usual and reasonable course for any Deputy to take.  I named a date, but I am not by any means pinned to that date.  I do take exception, very grave exception, to the attitude of mind and to the method by which the introduction of a measure by a Private Member has been met by the head of the Government.  I do think it would be well to have the presence of the Minister for Justice, though at the same time I must agree with Deputy Morrissey that probably the President knows a great deal more about the position, the situation and the conditions of town tenants, as he should, being a Dublin man, than does the Minister for Justice, but the Minister for Justice is in control of that Department. I am only too anxious to give that Department every opportunity of considering this measure. 
     
     There is another matter on which I would like to enter a protest, and that is, the underlying assumption of knowledge on the part of Ministers of the contents of the Bill I am proposing. They have spoken about this Bill as if they knew what was in it.  There has even been an attempt to suggest that it was not in order because it was the same Bill as was introduced before.   How could they say that unless they knew what was in the Bill, and they do not know what is in the Bill?  To take up the attitude of refusing to hear what is in the Bill and of postponing the Second Reading for such a length of time, I say is nothing but blind opposition to a proposal because it comes from a source of which they do not approve.  I am asked to yield.  I yield absolutely nothing in my right as a Private Member of this House to occupy the time of Private Members, in my own proper way, in my own time and in my own order.  I yield nothing to the suggestion that I should forego that, but I am prepared, certainly, to accommodate the Minister for Justice. If I had been asked to do that originally we would not have had this discussion. I am prepared to meet him and his Department, and to give them ample time to consider this Bill, but, as Deputy Johnson and others have pointed out, the unfortunate feature about it is that they will not be able to consider this Bill properly until its Second Reading. 
     
      
       Surely on to-morrow, or on whatever day it is in our hands, we could consider it. 
     
     
      
       Well, they could consider it to-morrow.  If the discussion on the Second Reading was allowed to take place, it would clear the air considerably.  It would in no way interfere with the Department in the prosecution of the subject-matter of the Bill.  It has been suggested by Deputy Corish that the Second Reading should take place, say, a fortnight hence.  As I said before, I am not pinned to any date.  I merely suggested this day week because it was the most natural and proper thing for anyone proposing a measure by way of a Private Member's Bill.  I am perfectly willing to take this day fortnight, but I think, following up the suggestion that has also been made, that it would be better that the Second Reading should be taken, and then that the matter be considered by the Department and the Ministry, and, if possible, let there be accommodation upon it.  I am only too anxious, as this is a Private Member's Bill, to do everything   in my power to get the Government to adopt the Bill as their own.  If they would be prepared to offer me any accommodation in future in that respect, I would be certainly prepared to offer them accommodation now.  But I think two months is rather a long time, and I do think also that it is a bad precedent to have that when a Bill is introduced by a Private Member the Government should say: &ldquo;We will not be able to deal with this.  We must postpone it for a certain time.&rdquo;  But in the circumstances, in the absence of the Minister for Justice, on the second consideration put forward by the President the second time he spoke, I certainly feel that I cannot resist the appeal to accommodate, but not to accommodate to the extent that has been asked of me, and I certainly think that the least the Government might do would be to allow the Second Reading to take place on this day fortnight, or before the Christmas Recess, if that will suit. 
     
     
      
       I have a motion that the Second Reading be taken on the 24th November, and an amendment that the date be the 19th January.  I will put the amendment first, if no agreement is reached or if the amendment is not withdrawn. 
     
     
      
       Does it not now stand in the position that the motion is in fact amended to the 1st December? I feel that I am empowered to make a change in the amendment.  I do not know whether it would be regarded as any great approach to Deputy Redmond if I were to say the first day on the resumption after the Recess, but I would ask Deputy Redmond to consider the time.  The Imperial Conference will not get back to its plenary sittings until the beginning of next week.  It is doubtful if they will have finished by this day week.  I do not believe that it is possible.  They may go on the whole of next week.  This new amendment would give the Minister for Justice about three days in which to be in touch with his Department on the matter.  I would ask that it should be postponed further, considering the importance of the measure and the serious consideration that has   to be given to it.  There is then the intervention of the Christmas period. Two months may seem long out of the twelve months of the year, but when taken in relation to the business and the days that arc free from business it would not be too long a postponement. I would ask the Deputy to agree to the postponement, taking it definitely and clearly that there is no challenge to his right to the use of Private Members' time.  I would therefore ask him to agree to a postponement until the first day after the Recess on which Private Members' business is possible. 
     
     
      
       I urge that this matter ought to be dealt with before the Recess.  We probably will not be adjourning, assuming that there is business, until close upon the 18th or the 20th December.  The 8th December would be three weeks from now and the 15th four weeks from now.  If it is not possible to deal with a Bill of this kind in four weeks because of the absence of the Minister for Justice, I think that there are Ministers who could&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       That is only one item, one of a great number. 
     
     
      
       That is so.  I quite understand that.  But the proposition really amounts to this, that nobody but Ministers should have the right to bring in Bills.  That is the effect of it, because you may say that Departments are full up, that Ministers cannot deal with the matters that they have already in their charge, and that therefore a Private Member's Bill cannot be discussed. That is the logical end of that particular argument, and I think that the offer that is made by Deputy Redmond, that is to say, for a fortnight from now, might easily be amended, provided that the discussion is taken before the adjournment for the Christmas holidays. 
     
     
      
       I am quite prepared to accept Deputy Johnson's suggestion.  I think that the matter might be dealt with before the Recess. 
     
     
      
       All I can say is that I was certainly in earnest in suggesting the Second Reading on the 19th January.  I suggested it after careful consideration and in the light   of all the circumstances.  It is not alone on account of the Minister's absence, but for other reasons. 
     
     
     
      
       Will the President give us the other reasons?

     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time on 19th January, 1927&rdquo;&mdash;put and declared carried. 
   
   
     PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS. - PROPOSALS TO AMEND CONSTITUTION&mdash;REFERENCE TO SELECT COMMITTEE. 
     
      
       I move: 
       That a Select Committee, consisting of ten Deputies, be appointed to make recommendations regarding certain proposals for legislation to amend the Constitution. 
       That the Ceann Comhairle be chairman of the committee. 
       That the quorum of the committee be six, and that the committee report back to the Dail not later than December 1st. 
     
     
      
       That will dispose of items 4 to 7, inclusive, on the Orders of the Day. 
     
     
        Ordered: That the Orders of Tuesday, 16th November, referring Constitution Bills, Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 to a Select Committee, be discharged. 
     
      
       The only comment I have to make on the resolution I have moved is that, in considering any recommendations regarding amendments to the Constitution, we ought to establish the principle that the Ceann Comhairle should be Chairman of the Committees appointed for the purpose.  I think there will be general agreement on that.  I presume that this Committee and the Committee that is dealing with the Land Bill would require the whole of a week to consider the proposals, and I think they ought not to have the duty of attending the Dail during that time.  In the circumstances, I propose that we should not meet next week, so that when we re-assemble on the following week we shall have these reports. 
     
     
      
       I have no objection to the proposal of the President, but, in connection with the suggestion that we should not meet next week, I should like to draw the President's attention to the fact that I have put down a motion which, if the ordinary notice were required, might not be taken until Wednesday next.  It is a motion regarding unemployment and unemployment insurance. If the President is desirous that the House should not meet next week, perhaps he would afford facilities for taking this motion on Friday. 
     
     
      
       I should like Deputy Johnson to give me a little time to consider that suggestion.  I have not made up the time-table yet, but if it is possible, I will meet him. 
     
     
      
       I should not like that next week pass over without having this matter discussed. 
     
     
      
       I quite understand that.  Would I be at liberty to consider an earlier day than Friday&mdash; say, to-morrow&mdash;for Deputy Johnson's motion? 
     
     
      
       So far as I am concerned, yes. 
     
     
     
      
       I may be able to arrange it for to-morrow. 
       Question put and agreed to. 
       Ordered&mdash;&ldquo;That the Committee of Selection nominate nine Deputies to serve on the Select Committee.&rdquo; 
     
   
   
     PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS. - PUBLIC SAFETY (EMERGENCY POWERS) BILL, 1926&mdash;SECOND STAGE. 
     
      
       Is it right or proper to proceed with this Bill in the absence of the Minister for Justice? 
     
     
      
       Deputies will have to make allowance for that.  In the course of a brief statement which I made yesterday when asking for permission to introduce the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Bill, I promised that I would bring to the notice of the Dail a chain of circumstances showing that a conspiracy to subvert the authority of the State has been in active existence for some time past. Regarded as isolated incidents, these events might perhaps attract little attention but, when taken together and analysed, they leave no room for doubt that there exists in the country a small body of men who will not hesitate at crime in their desire to override the will of the people by force of arms. 
     
     For the past two years, a steady stream of information has been received by the Garda Siochana, which has enabled them to trace and remove numerous hidden dumps of arms, ammunition and military equipment, which had obviously been secreted for illegal purposes, and evidence was available that these discoveries were causing considerable uneasiness among a certain small section of the community. On the 16th July last a letter was received by a military officer in Cork City to the effect that a dump of this nature was to be found at Frankfield, Douglas, County Cork.  Information was conveyed to the local Superintendent of Police, and, on the following day, accompanied by four detective officers, he proceeded to the place and searched the out-offices of the destroyed residence of Colonel Gibbons. In the course of the search, the Superintendent observed a small door upstairs fastened by a nail fixed over the latch.  On forcing the nail to one   side, and raising the latch, there was immediately a loud explosion which blew the roof off the room, and burst out the door and side walls.  The Superintendent was hurled back; several bones in his hands were fractured and his left leg was torn in three places by shrapnel.  An examination of the scene revealed that a trap-mine had been laid in the room and so arranged that the lifting of the latch would cause it to explode.  It is clear that this fiendish trap was laid with a view to causing the deaths of members of the military or of the police instructed to search the place in the execution of their duty, and that it was hoped, by means of this outrage, to deter officers of the State from continuing those activities which had resulted in the capture of so many illegal dumps. 
     Some time previous to this, an armed raid was made on Mountjoy Prison. Dublin, and several prisoners, who were charged with various offences of violence against the State or individuals, were rescued.  One of these was subsequently traced to London and arrested there.  On his arrest he was found in possession of a large number of .45 revolvers which he had obviously intended to smuggle into Ireland. Shortly after the mine incident, to which I have referred, there was a series of armed raids on moneylenders in Dublin and elsewhere, which were obviously organised from a single centre.  The persons responsible for the Dublin raids were discovered and duly convicted.  In the course of the police investigation which resulted in the discovery of the property stolen by the raiders, there was found, in addition to a revolver and ammunition, a despatch in the possession of a youthful courier, directed to a person addressed as the &ldquo;O/C of the Dublin Brigade.&rdquo;  The despatch made reference to a box which had been forwarded by rail to the manager of a creamery in County Cork.  The police traced the box and found that it contained half a hundredweight of a home-made explosive, known as &ldquo;War Flour.&rdquo; 
     
        About a fortnight ago, the attention of the police was attracted to unusual activities in the Midlands on the part of a certain individual who claims to be the &ldquo;Chief of Staff&rdquo; of this armed organisation and placed him under arrest.  He is at present awaiting trial on a charge under the Treasonable Offences Act.  Though resident in Dublin, he is a native of Cork and this fact is believed to be not altogether unconnected with the events of Sunday night. 
     On the 10th of this month the police held up a motor car in Middleton, which had previously disobeyed a signal to stop.  There were four men in the car.  A fully loaded Webley revolver was found under the front seat and nine rounds of revolver ammunition underneath the back seat.  Documents in their possession showed that these four men were members of the so-called &ldquo;Staff&rdquo; of the 4th Battalion of the Cork Number 1 Irregular Brigade, acting on instructions from a person in Dublin calling himself &ldquo;Adjutant General,&rdquo; and that the organisation of which they were members had decided that the only effective means by which its objects could be achieved were by force of arms.  I have a copy of the document which was found.  It reads:&mdash;

     To: 
     Commanders of Independent Units. 
     VOLUNTEERS AS PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATES. 
     1.  The Army Council has directed that the following statement and Order be circulated. 
     &ldquo;Oglaigh na h-Eireann was created and is being maintained primarily for the following object: 
     &ldquo;To establish and uphold a lawful Government in sole and absolute control of the Republic.&rdquo; 
     &ldquo;The primary, and it is believed   by the Army Council, the only `effecting ' means by which this object can be achieved, are as stated in the Constitution: 
     1.  Force of arms. 
     2.  Organisation, training and equipping the manhood as an effective military force. 
     &ldquo;The Army Council is decidedly of opinion that these means can best be promoted when a Volunteer is free to concentrate on them and is not distracted by holding the responsible position of T.D., and endeavouring to fulfil the duties attaching to it.  Further, and especially bearing in mind late experiences, there is the danger of military discipline being impaired.  The Army Council hereby order: 
     &ldquo;That a member of Oglaigh na h-Eireann shall not permit himself to be put forward or accept nomination as a candidate in any constituency for which Teachtai are being elected, and that this Order shall be transmitted to all ranks.&rdquo;

     A/General. 
     On Sunday night we had the criminal outbreak which is so fresh in our minds to-day, and which resulted in the wounding of a private soldier and in the untimely deaths of two gallant members of our unarmed police force, whose only crime was that they had fearlessly and impartially carried out the duties entrusted to them&mdash;namely, the protection of the rights of the people.  We have paid a last tribute to these two young men who were laid to rest to-day; but we have a duty to the living as well, and we are bound to provide some protection for their comrades, who, though themselves unarmed, have to do their duty unflinchingly, in the face of armed attacks from an organised body, whose members stop at nothing&mdash;not even murder&mdash;in their attempts to achieve their objects. 
     It is clear that the events of Sunday night were a definite challenge to the   authority of the State and a desperate effort to intimidate the police from carrying out their duty to the State. We hope to be successful in collecting evidence against the actual perpetrators, and I trust we will be able to bring the murderers to justice.  But it is clearly difficult to deal with a conspiracy of this kind by the ordinary criminal processes.  The elaborate safeguards which these contain for the prevention of miscarriage of justice, though absolutely necessary in normal circumstances, render these processes inapplicable to an emergency such as that which was created for a few hours on Sunday night.  It may be possible to trace the misguided individuals who actually took part in the raids, but the chief instigators&mdash;the real criminals&mdash;though they are well known to the police, are very careful to avoid, as far as possible, leaving evidence which would secure their conviction in a court of law.  It is essential, therefore, that the Executive Council should have special powers which will enable them to deal promptly with an emergency of this nature and for this purpose we are asking the Dail to give a speedy passage to this Bill. 
     The Act is intended to be a permanent one, but it will only be brought into operation in time of emergency, and following the issue of a formal proclamation by the Executive Council which will be laid forthwith before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I accordingly move the Second Reading. 
     
      
       I intend to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill on the same grounds as I opposed the First Reading yesterday.  To my mind the measure is unnecessary.  No Deputy has more respect for the members of the Garda Siochana or the military in the Saorstat than I have.  I am quite sure there is not a loyal citizen in the State who would protect the lives of these men sooner than I would and I do regret very much the loss the State and the relatives of these men who were shot in Sunday night's raids, have suffered. 
     
     In this measure the President is asking for powers that the Executive   Council already possess in the Treason Act.  Section 3 of the Treason Act gives power to the Executive Council to arrest any person who commits or attempts to commit any offence against the State, and that person shall be liable to a fine of £500 or two years' imprisonment with or without hard labour, or both.  Section 6 of the Act gives power to the Garda and the military to imprison for a term not exceeding five years any person found guilty of forming or attempting to form an unauthorised military or police force. Section 8 of the Treason Act gives power to any authorised officer to arrest and put into prison for a term of two years, or otherwise fine £100, any person who is in a secret society or in an unauthorised army or police force. I put it to the President that under that measure he has plenty of power to deal with the people he has in mind, and whom he mentions the Garda know well&mdash;the people who committed the crimes connected with the raids on Sunday night. 
     Under this proposed measure the Executive Council seek power to arrest any person.  It makes no matter whether a man or woman has committed a crime.  If a man or a woman has an enemy living in the neighbourhood, and if that enemy sends a letter to the Garda saying that such a man or such a woman is out drilling or doing something wrong, he or she can be arrested irrespective of whether they are loyal citizens to the State.  The Government want power to arrest such a person and keep that person in prison for a week or until such time as an appeal can be made to the Appeal Council; then, if the Council recommends the release of that person, it rests with the Minister or the Executive Council as a whole, to order the release within one month after the recommendation for release is made. 
     In the Schedule of this measure it is set out that punishment will be inflicted for 
     Unlawfully injuring or destroying or attempting to injure or destroy any house, factory, barn, haggard, workshop, or other building, or any agricultural property,   food supplies for man or beast, or any other property of any nature or kind, movable or immovable, public or private, including standing trees and crops. 
     I am glad to note that they place man in the same category as beast there. At the present time there is a great scarcity of fuel and, apparently, if a man went out to cut a tree on his own or his neighbour's land and a Garda saw him doing so, he could arrest that man and imprison him, notwithstanding the fact that the Government has made no provision for people in the way of a fuel supply. 
     Not alone are the Government asking us to assist in putting down armed raids, but they even want permission to arrest a man for cutting down a tree on his own land for the purpose of providing himself with fuel.  I know well that the intention is to deal with a man cutting down a tree in order to put it across a road, but the Bill does not state that.  I do not see why the Dail should pass such a measure as this. 
     Since I had the honour of being elected a member of this House, I have opposed the different Public Safety Acts, including the well-known unpopular measure, the Flogging Act. Between 1922 and 1924 a large number of Deputies opposed such measures. I sincerely hope the same Deputies have not been influenced by the Government to such an extent that they will support this latest measure of crucifixion, to be known as the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act.  If we allow the Executive Council to obtain such powers as they seek under this measure, we will be placing in their hands every citizen of the State. 
     There is nothing to prevent the Government from sending their agents down the country making wholesale arrests and making a general sweep of the country.  These agents can drive in, like a lot of cattle, every person they find on the streets and put them into prison.  These people will not be released until they come before a Justice who can bind them to the peace for three months or three years. In other words, the intention is to make every citizen a ticket-of-leave   man or convict.  This Bill aims at making a convict of every citizen in the State.  Whether a citizen is loyal or disloyal, so long as information is given against him, an officer of the Gardai or even a sergeant or private soldier of the Defence Forces can arrest him.  If a private soldier or officer is told that a certain man is going to commit an offence, he thereupon has power to arrest that man and search his house.  Whether that man is a loyal citizen or not it will not matter.  He will be arrested for a crime that he did not intend to commit and he will not be released unless he signs an undertaking that he will keep the peace that he had never broken. He must sign a statement indicating that he will not commit a crime which he had no intention of committing. 
     Surely that is wrong.  It only means that every loyal citizen of the State is being driven by the present Government against it.  They are certainly doing their level best to turn the people against the Government of the country. We had an example of what the Government wants to do under this measure when, down in South Westmeath, we found, on Monday morning last, that the Gardai were going helter-skelter through the country. They arrested ten young men in that district.  Why in the name of Providence were those ten men arrested?  These ten men were at their usual occupations; they had not been out drilling and they were not engaged on those raids on Sunday night.  They were miles and miles away from where those raids took place.  Why should the Gardai come down and arrest these men?  Simply because these men at one time stood loyal to what they thought they were fighting for&mdash;a Republic for this country.  These men were not led astray like some of us were.  These men never thought their representatives would go across crawling to the King of England as some of the representatives of this country are doing to-day.  We put out the old Irish Party&mdash;&mdash; 
     
      
       I am afraid that matter does not arise on this Bill. 
     
     
     
      
       It arises on the question of the principle that these men are fighting for now, and because they are fighting for their principles you must arrest them and throw them into prison without trial or charge.  If this Bill were introduced by England during the time that the old Irish Party were sitting in Westminster, there is no mistake there would be far greater opposition.  But we put out the old Irish Party and succeeded in establishing a Government in the Irish Free State and we find that more drastic legislation has been introduced by that Government since they came into power than was ever introduced by England when the old Irish M.P.'s were sitting at Westminster. 
       Those ten men who are at present imprisoned in Athlone have, for more than two years, given up completely the idea of fighting for the freedom or the sovereign independence of this country. They went back to their work.  Now we find this legislation is introduced. No mistake, the Government will be able to succeed in getting this legislation passed so as to enable them to keep those men and their equals throughout the Saorstat in prison, or else get them to sign allegiance to the Irish Free State, or otherwise be bound to the peace for three years, having two solvent sureties.  Now, surely that is not necessary. 
       I could quite understand the introduction of legislation to deal with a man who had been captured actually committing a crime, or who was caught when about to commit a crime.  I solemnly confess to the Dail that if I knew those men who shot the two Gardai on Sunday night I would have no hesitation myself in shooting them without ever letting them go to the scaffold.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  But why should I punish a man because I am told that he is about to commit a crime, or that a couple of years ago he was against the State? 
     
     You are asking for legislation to enable you to punish a large number of loyal citizens of the State.  I, at least, will certainly vote against this Bill, and, furthermore.  I ask every Deputy who, in the past, spoke and voted against the Public Safety Acts, not to   be led astray now because our representatives and our Ministers and even some of our Deputies are getting into high society.  I ask them not to be led astray by that class of influence that has succeeded by beautiful smiles in drawing our Ministers like magnets to the other side of the water to join high society. 
     I ask those Deputies who have voted and spoken against these measures in the past to realise that the majority of those men against whom the Government now seek legislation are workingmen, small farmers and small farmers' sons.  If the Government is given this power, they will within three months or probably before Christmas have four hundred or five hundred people rounded up and put into prison.  The majority of these will be the working people.  There is a certain strong desire to arrest these men.  We are told they cannot find employment for them. 
     We may be told by some Gardai, some soldier, or some civilian that they are not what you might call real loyal citizens of the Saorstat, but they may be a lot more loyal than those who give information against them.  It could be said &ldquo;We do not want them and they must be arrested.&rdquo;  I would also appeal to those people who are going round the country shouting economy not to support this measure, for, if they do, it will mean that there will have to be supplementary estimates for the upkeep of a large number of persons who at present are capable of maintaining their families and other dependents. These people will have to be maintained by the State, as was the case in 1922 and 1923 when it cost the country up to £70,000 or £80,000 to maintain them in prison.  The same thing will happen again.  I ask all sections of the Dail to vote against this Bill, which to my mind is unnecessary, as the Government have ample power under the Treason Act, whereby a man who even thinks of committing a crime may be arrested.  A man may, in the presence of one or two others, say that it would be a good job if the country were upset again, as a lot of money would be in circulation and he might be able to buy a shop or a farm.  A man might say   that without any intention of upsetting the country, but under the Treason Act he would have to be arrested and either put into gaol for two years or fined five hundred pounds.  Even if the person listening to him did not become a common informer and give information he could be arrested.  The Saorstat Government is too loyal to the other side, and we are asked to carry out England's dirty work.  England had not the pluck to introduce a measure like this in this country, but she gets the Government here to do it.  If this Bill is allowed to become law it will do a great injustice to the majority of the people.  I am surprised that the death penalty is not included in it.  The Flogging Act is still in existence.  That is another Public Safety Act.  The death sentence is not included in this; probably they did not think of it. 
     
      
       It could be amended. 
     
     
      
       It could be amended. and some people would agree to do so, even to the extent of having their brothers and sisters shot in the interests of England.  I hope that every Deputy will realise that the Government have ample power to deal with any crisis that may arise and can protect themselves and the people as well as the people's property and the State in general without asking for further measures.  I have no doubt that if this measure becomes an Act we will have a general round-up in the country. Who will be the sufferers?  The unfortunate victims who were led astray by present Ministers who told them they were fighting for sovereign independence, people who were blinded while defending their country and who were not looked after by the Government. Several of them are crippled.  Some are in the workhouse and some are not able to look after their little ones owing to the hardships they suffered while fighting for their country.  That is the fulfilment of promises made to them.  Even cripples, persons who have lost their legs and arms while fighting for their country, if they are not now loyal to the State, can be arrested.  I am glad to see Deputy Gorey at his usual stunt&mdash;a sneer of contempt&mdash;but what can you expect   from a supplicant to England, what can you expect from a pig but a grunt? 
     
     
      
       That is an improper remark and I ask the Deputy to withdraw it. 
     
     
      
       I am sorry.  I withdraw. I did not mean it. 
     
     
      
       The Dail may be insulted but I am not and I do not ask him to withdraw. 
     
     
      
       I do not know if the House has had an opportunity to consider this Bill and its import.  I hoped the President would have been able to make a case for it, and I am very much surprised he has made such a slender case on which to build so drastic a measure.  He has come to certain assumptions from the information in his possession.  I do not know whether the whole of the information in his possession has been related to us, but if the whole story on which he bases the case for this Bill has been told, it seems to be a very slender basis for a Bill of this nature, which is permanent in its character.  We have learned that certain documents were found, and that certain incidents occurred.  I suppose there has been no period, say within the past two years, in which information of this kind has not been in his hands.  Incidents more or less isolated have taken place of a criminal nature which might well have justified some provision if such were necessary. Now, because of the events of last Sunday and the signs which the President seems to connect up of a widespread organisation purporting to be of a military kind and engaged in criminal undertakings&mdash;I do not hesitate to use the adjective&mdash;a new class of measure or a re-enactment of an old class of measure has to be brought forward under the name of &ldquo;emergency powers.&rdquo;  I think it is very doubtful wisdom to enact a measure of this kind with such a name.  References to the &ldquo;overthrow of the Government,&rdquo;&ldquo;subverting loyalty,&rdquo; and so on, seem to me to lift the organisation in question to a plane which it hardly deserves.  I think it is just the thing that these people would like and rejoice at.  What is proposed?  If one could   put it in a sentence or two, it is proposed to give power to the Executive to intern whomever may be reported to them as being suspect.  That means pretty well a re-enactment of provisions under which some thousands were interned a few years ago.  Two years ago the situation was very much more like a national emergency than it is to-day. I am afraid this proposal will be taken as a measure of the inability of the Government to stabilise the country. It will rather be a confession of inefficiency of the Defence Forces and the Garda Siochana. 
     
     The information the President has related to us is in his hands.  A good many operations have taken place recently, and a stream of information to that effect, so the President says, has been coming in to the Government for a year.  If the Garda Siochana is not competent&mdash;I will not say competent&mdash; not able to follow np that information, and, steadily and with increasing efficacy, wipe out such organisation, I think it will be taken as a confession of the inefficiency of that body, and of the unsatisfactory system of police administration, or of defence of the State.  I do not believe that is the position at all.  I think the position is that there has been a steady improvement due to the work of the Garda and the work of the Ministry in general, so far as this particular matter is concerned. To come along now, in view of a series of incidents which appear to be connected, and tell this organisation by an enactment of this House that they are a terribly important element, that we are afraid they may succeed in subverting the stability of the State, and therefore, we must adopt these extreme measures&mdash;I do not think that is going to do any good to the credit of the State.  It will create a kind of scare in the community, and is very unlikely, I think, to have any more success than could be achieved by the usual process of police inquiry. The Ministers, of course, with their experience, will controvert that.  They will say: &ldquo;We know better; you are looking at the question from the outside. We are looking at it from within.&rdquo;  I feel certain that the methods adopted in this Bill to meet   conditions which have suddenly sprouted are badly conceived, to begin with. 
     Assuming it is a desirable power to give to any Ministry, to arrest and intern indefinitely any suspect, it is here proposed that that should be the ordinary law, that it should be part of the permanent legislation, so that at any time a Ministry come to the conclusion that a state of emergency has arisen, they may make a proclamation, and on that the Executive of the time may be empowered to proceed with the policy of interning suspects.  Of course, there is an appeal, and an appeal council, and so on, but I am not quite sure that that procedure was at all satisfactory in the past.  The Executive Minister has the final decision. The appeal council is not a court, and whatever evidence may be available for the appeal council, if the Minister is not satisfied, he is to be empowered to put any suspect in internment.  I am pointing out that this Bill is not merely one for present conditions.  It is intended that this Bill should be a permanent enactment, so that at any time in the future, notwithstanding what the conditions of peace or stability may be, the Executive of the time shall have these powers.  I think they are most dangerous powers to give to any Executive.  It may be said that the immediate circumstances are such as may require them.  That may be proved.  It has not yet been proved. It may be proved that there is need in the circumstances of to-day of such powers, that they ought to be given, or that a Ministry in five years' time may find that a certain situation has arisen which would require them to go to Parliament for such powers.  Let each application be considered on its merits, and on the evidence then forthcoming, and let us not enact permanent legislation of that kind to be called into operation on a proclamation.  So far as that criticism is concerned, it is against the permanent character of the measure, and I cannot agree to such a proposition being embodied in the statutory law. 
     Supposing this were a Bill without art I., which would enable powers of   this kind to be exercised by the Government in circumstances that have suddenly arisen, let us from that point of view consider it for a moment.  Has a case been made for these extraordinary powers?  Was our recent experience satisfactory and does it encourage us to the belief that the powers of internment are going to be used with the restraint and care that any such powers ought, if ever they are going to be used?  I fear very much that the headline set in these proceedings is going rather to excite suspicions, and we are giving freedom to the Minister to intern large numbers of people at a time when we believe, at any rate, that there is a steady settling down.  If we were readers of newspapers, if we kept our ears to the ground, and if we were conscious, as we were, that there still existed a military organisation of a secret kind, which was proposing to do, however few there may be left in it, what was proposed by larger numbers of their predecessors, I do not think it would be good business or good policy to get into a state of excitement over a small organisation, or a small number of people, who were adopting an extremist physical force attitude.  I think it is safer and better public policy to proceed steadily by normal processes, enlarged, if you like, intensified, if yon like, by larger numbers when necessary.  I think there would be less danger to the State if that method was adopted on the evidence that has been adduced.  I feel that the case made by the President is thoroughly inadequate for the proposition that these very excessive powers should be handed over to the executive authority. Even if the case were very much stronger than has been put forward I would still oppose the proposition that this should be the normal law of the country. 
     I do not think it is good that we should have upon the Statute Book a measure of this kind which pre-supposes that insurrectionary movements are going to be a part of the normal life of the country.  If anything is going to destroy confidence in the future of the country it is the assumption that insurrection is to be more or less   periodic and to be expected in regular sequence.  I think it is quite undesirable that we should establish that proposition by an enactment of a permanent character like this. 
     I recognise that Ministers have special responsibilities and that they have special knowledge which may not have been disclosed but I hope, before they ask us to decide the fate of this Bill, they will put forward a very much stronger case, or that they can put forward a very much stronger case. Otherwise I think they have acted without discretion, without proper care and without real regard to the proportion of things when they introduce a Bill of this kind. 
     
      
       I take a very different view of this question from Deputy Johnson.  I think the living people of this country demand as much respect as the dead.  Attending the funeral of the victims of those recent outrages, to-day, one was struck with the imposing procession and the numbers of people massed on the side walks, and the idea crossed one's mind that this was a beautiful country to die in.  I believe the dead are paid as much respect here as in any country in the world.  We do not seem at all to pay as much attention to the living as to the dead. 
       Objection to this measure can only be founded on the fear that this Government, or some other Government, will abuse the provisions of this Bill in such a way that it is not safe to give these powers to this or to any other Government.  But we must be aware that the civic spirit is not developed here as it is in other countries.  It is not developed here as it is in England or the Continent or in America.  The nursing of that spirit is the duty of any Government.  I do not care whether it is this Government or any succeeding Government, but the nursing and the growth of the civic spirit is something that demands attention in this country.  It has reached a very low ebb at the moment, I am sorry to have to confess. 
     
     I am sure it is the opinion all round that things can happen in this country that could not happen in any other country.  Crimes can be committed   when several people are about and where several people know the perpetrators and do not give information so that nothing is done.  There is considerable difficulty on the part of the police force in securing information. People are timid.  In the rural districts police stations are far apart and proper protection is not forthcoming in very large areas in the country, with the result that people are timid.  They do not like to be visited, in the night, by people with firearms.  There is a terrorism which does not stop at threatening, but extends very much farther.  And that state of affairs is the rule and not the exception, where people are exposed without any protection to raids from gunmen and in many cases life has been lost. 
     I believe in order to foster the growth of the civic spirit that we all desire, this measure, or some other measure of a similar description, is necessary.  The incidents of Sunday night last cannot be described as isolated cases.  Evidently orders were sent out from some centre.  These orders were obeyed perhaps only to a limited extent.  I would not be surprised if there were a general order over the country and that it was only carried out in certain places.  I do not know what information the Government has on the question.  I have spoken to no member of the Government and I have no information myself. 
     I regret one thing, and that is that the old manly spirit, the spirit of manhood which I understood when I was a lad and for several years later, has departed from the country.  The Irishman had the reputation of turning his back on nobody, in peace or in war, and he had the reputation of attacking nobody from behind.  When I was young anyone was disgraced who did not stand up to another and hit him in the face.  The man who used a weapon from behind was considered a coward. In the wild and woolly West in America in the worst mining camp a certain code obtained; men were not shot from behind.  A man got a chance of drawing his gun.  If one was quicker than the other, that was his look-out. They had to cultivate speed in quickness   on the draw.  But if anyone did anything outside a certain code in these mining camps every man in the place turned on him, and he was riddled on the spot or else taken out and lynched.  I do not think that even the standard of the wild and woolly West obtains here. 
     I think we have gone very far down the scale when, in Ireland, houses can be raided in the night, people taken out and shot or beaten and terrified with lethal weapons.  I am absolutely convinced that the people who do these things in the majority of cases would not take on &ldquo;an even-money-chance.&rdquo; It would be a ten-to-one on; they would want to be absolutely certain that the people they visited had no means of defending themselves.  They would want to be absolutely certain that these people had no arms, and it is perhaps a ten or twenty-to-one on chance, when these brave men come along, that they are sure nothing can happen to themselves when attacking a house or an individual.  It is a painful thing for any Irishman to have to admit that this standard of manhood has been reached.  I do not think it is manhood at all.  It is far less than manhood, and any measure that will restore our manhood and civic spirit and put an end to the operations of the blackguard, and it is nothing else than the worst type of blackguardism which is disgracing Ireland, will not be abused.  I have no fear that this measure is going to be abused.  Similar measures have been passed before, and I do not think it can be said that they have been abused.  Therefore, I do not think there is any danger that this one is going to be abused. 
     
      
       May I ask the Deputy why did his Party, after the 1923 election, put forward a motion asking for the release of the prisoners then detained? 
     
     
      
       I do not generally take notice of anything the Deputy says, and I will let his remark pass.  I am going to vote for this Bill, and I think the Deputies who sit behind me will also vote for it, not from choice but   from necessity.  We regret the necessity. 
     
     
      
       I also wish to support the Bill.  I think that Deputy Johnson would have supported the measure if he had knowledge of the conditions in the country.  In a district in County Cork last week there were over one hundred men drilling fully armed and equipped with rifles and machine-guns.  That fact proves that a Bill like this is very much needed. It shows that there is apparently an organised movement to overthrow the Government by force. 
     
     
      
       This Bill is not required to meet that case. 
     
     
      
       It is to detain suspects or men who intend by force to overthrow the Government. 
     
     
      
       There is another Act for doing that. 
     
     
      
       In my opinion any person, political or non-political, found with arms in his possession without a licence should be liable to the full effect of this measure or any other such measure passed by the Dail.  I also wish to congratulate the Garda Siochana on the courage they have shown and the brave stand they made against the ruffians who carried out the outrages last Sunday night. Personally I shall always uphold law and order in the country and allow nobody to deter whatever Government is in power from doing their duty to the people they represent. 
     
     
      
       The overwhelming majority of the citizens of the country will express their deepest regret at the death of the unfortunate Gardai who have lost their lives, and there will be general detestation of the method by which their untimely end came about in such a physically unequal and shocking fashion.  While that is the case, and while it is my particular view, I am not at the same time convinced that the President has made an adequate case for the passage of a Bill giving the Government powers such as this Bill does.  The President referred to raids on money-lenders' premises in Dublin.  I think he will recollect that   the ordinary methods of the law were sufficient to deal with these cases.  He claimed that those who committed the offences have been brought to justice. They have been brought to justice then by the machinery of the ordinary law. If the machinery of the ordinary law was good enough in those cases, I think it ought to be good enough in similar cases, and we have not had any case which is very much greater in its seriousness than the raids on moneylenders' premises. 
     
     
      
       Not even murder? 
     
     
      
       We have had here, and I think rightly, tributes paid to the Garda Siochana for the manner in which they have helped to bring about normal conditions in the country.  We have had tributes paid to the progress which the Army is making.  Presumably there is a well-organised police force, a well-organised military force, and a well-organised detective force in the country.  With these three forces, I think we have adequate machinery to deal with any of the situations which the President referred to in his opening statement.  As a working-class representative, as a representative of a class that stands to gain substantially by ordered conditions and by peace and quietness, I have no use whatever for militarists, of whatever brand they may be, who rely on the revolver or the gun as their sole authority. At the same time, Section 4 of this Bill gives the Government the right to arrest and intern people without charge or trial, and to keep them at the Minister's discretion in permanent internment if necessary, or in internment, at all events, for a very substantial period.  The right of the citizen to be adjudged innocent until he is found guilty, is a well-recognised and well-established right, and to give to any Government, whether it be the present Government or a Labour Government, the right to arrest a citizen and to place him in an internment camp without trial, is to give to that Government the power to abrogate the inalienable right of the citizen.  It may be necessary on certain occasions that that right should be given to Governments. It may be necessary in times   of serious national stress that the Government should possess those rights; but the present, in my opinion, is not the time, and until such time as we are satisfied that the country is in real and serious danger of attack, from inside or outside, we ought not to give to the Government the powers sought in Section 4. 
       The passage of this Bill might reasonably be taken as a reflex of the condition of the country.  The country is not in the condition that this Bill indicates.  The country is not in a condition that it needs a Bill of this abnormal character to deal with ordinary offences against the State or persons or property, and until such time as we are not satisfied with the administration of the police code and of the military code, there is, in my opinion, no necessity for a Bill of this character which gives the Government powers that they ought not to have in a country which is as quiet and peaceful comparatively, as this country is to-day. 
     
     
      
       I rise also to support the passage of the Bill. I should like that we would get away for a moment from the realms of rhetoric and come down to the logic of facts.  I ask myself, with reference to this Bill: Is it or is it not a fact that a proclamation must be issued by the Executive Council declaring that a state of emergency exists?  I ask myself also: Is that a thing lightly to be embarked upon, or will the need for the proclamation only arise when very grave reason indeed presents itself?  Let us consider for a moment what the effect of the proclamation will be on the economic life of the country.  It is not martial law certainly, but it is something moving in the direction of martial law and it means the exercise of extraordinary powers vested in the Executive Council. There is the great likelihood, and perhaps very great danger, that the mere issue of a proclamation similar in import to what we are asked to pass would very seriously affect the financial credit of the country.  Take the credit of the Government's securities, for instance, and the prices at which they are quoted on the Stock Exchange.  Is it likely that these   prices will be enhanced by the declaration of the Executive Council that a state of emergency exists?  No Executive Council with any prudence or consideration for the public weal would put such a proclamation into effect if they thought it would injure the National credit.  I submit they could not do so.  The thing itself would be commented upon abroad, and it would injure our credit at home and abroad.  I claim that the issue of such a proclamation as this Bill contemplates would have that effect, and that it is not lightly to be embarked upon, and that only for very grave and sufficient reasons should the powers that we are now asked to confer on the Executive Council be given.  It is well, as I said at the opening, that we should get down to the logic of facts.  Is it not a fact that there were ten or twelve simultaneous raids carried out on Civic Guard stations throughout the length and breadth of the country, in itself a sufficient indication of a widespread conspiracy, and is it not a politic thing to resist small beginnings?  Is it not a fair and proper thing to let these people know that we are wide awake and that our hands are not powerless and that while, perhaps, the initiative for the moment lies with them it is well to let them know that they are backing a loser every time?  I for one would like to speak a word or two to these people across the void.  If they believe that we are helpless or that we are impotent to deal with their activities, then I say that they are backing a loser, and that it is they themselves who are the losers.  This is a preventive measure.  Wherever there is reason to believe that there is such a thing as a revolutionary element in this country, these persons will have to be faced.  It is well they should realise that they are not going to have the game all their own way.  This is a preventive measure.  These people cannot be blind to experience.  The permanency of this measure will be an eye-opener to these men and will show them that they cannot act with impunity. This Bill will be an addition to, but will by no means abrogate, the existing law.  I am sure there is no   intention whatever of doing that.  We are acting as mildly as possible by merely providing for arrest and detention. The State itself must be preserved. Many challenges have been issued and many acts have been done to undermine it.  It has got to stop all that.  We are only taking the minimum of precaution in the passage of this Bill.  We hope as humane men that nothing further will be needed, but if anything further is needed to preserve the Constitution of the Saorstat it will be forthcoming. 
     
     
      
       I thought that the Government had shifted its position over to the Farmers' benches by the way the last Deputy addressed the Dail.  He said that &ldquo;we will put down this thing,&rdquo; that &ldquo;we are going to act mildly.&rdquo;  He probably contemplates some change.  In the first place I desire to protest against the introduction of this measure because its provisions seek to violate the principles that are too dear to be surrendered for the case the President has made.  It is a matter of regret to everybody that the incidents of the past few days have occurred.  It is a matter of regret that men have lost their lives, but it is just as well that we should detach ourselves from the particular in order to take a proper view of the general situation. In listening to the President this evening one was forced to the conclusion that his case was indeed a very poor one, and if that is the general situation as the President depicted it for us, surely there is no case made for the drastic provisions introduced here this evening.  Of course some men will tell us that the civic spirit is dead.  As a matter of fact it was never alive, as Deputy Gorey said, and he thinks the way to nurse it is to give power to the Government to arrest wholesale.  It may not be out of place to see what were the reasons adduced by the present Government for measures of this kind when they were introduced previously. I will quote a few of what they said were their reasons for introducing the Public Safety Bill previously. One Minister said: 
     
     &ldquo;The first part of the Bill, I take it, is made necessary by the fact that the technical state of war, which is the sole legal justification&mdash;I stress   the word legal&mdash;for the internment of a large number of prisoners, may be declared at an end long before the actual state of affairs would justify their release.  I think no one will seriously argue that those prisoners should be let out before the country returns to normal.&rdquo; 
     I ask the Dail is there at the moment a state of war, and are the conditions terrible and abnormal?  I quote from another Minister.  He said: 
     &ldquo;I endeavoured to make that position perfectly clear; there is, as I say, no secret about that.  Thirteen thousand people are at the moment held by virtue of military necessity based on a war condition.&rdquo; 
     Is there a military necessity to-day? Is there a war situation? 
     &ldquo;We have not legal power to hold them, but we consider that it would be highly dangerous and highly disastrous for the future of this country that these people should be released  en bloc  a day after the courts would have decided that the state of war strictly speaking had come to an end.&rdquo; 
     Further he said: &ldquo;What is the alternative? To release upon the country which is barely finding its feet, barely passing out from a stage of national hysteria to conditions of peace and order and to some kind of appreciation of civic responsibility thirteen thousand men who throughout the last year &mdash;or the great majority of them at any rate&mdash;have been engaged in the most heinous and disgraceful campaign of crime that ever disfigured the pages of this country's history; turn them out to man the hidden guns again if the people's vote in the coming election fails to coincide with their particular fancy or political preference.&rdquo;  Can anyone seriously suggest that any of the situations mentioned in these references exist to-day?  Is there a technical state of war, are the conditions wonderfully abnormal, and does the chain of events which, with some degree of interest and apprehension I waited for the President to give us, justify these very drastic measures? There was an event perhaps quite recently which would justify this declaration of a national emergency.   I think it is to the discredit of the Government that when there were perhaps thousands of lives in danger, because of a shortage of fuel, the Government did not declare a national emergency on that occasion, and not wait to introduce such drastic measures as they propose now under normal conditions.  This country has had a stretch of three years of peace, and it is well satisfied with the result. 
     The political judges in this country have found a method of expressing themselves in a constitutional fashion, and soon the people will find a method of expressing themselves at the general election on this matter.  It is worthy of note in this connection that the Government of this country always heralds the approach of a general election by the introduction of a Public Safety Bill.  Here we have one introduced now to be used if the votes of the people in the coming election fail to coincide with the political fancy of the Government.  We may, or may not, be near a general election, but it is a matter of some concern that powers have been put into the hands of the present Government so that they can arrest their political opponents wholesale, and that they can dragoon any part of the country as they please. The Government can dragoon any portion of the country that does not think their way, and can intern them indefinitely. It is possible they would have more of a fancy to arrest key men in the other political organisations, intern them and keep them in internment until it suited them to liberate them, and then come here and herald themselves as the chosen of the electorate. One can almost hear the swish of their wings like archangels descending on this House, or winging their way to some celestial region.  By the action you are proposing you are abrogating the responsibility of government, and reduce yourselves by that act to a manoeuvring political party. The right of trial of every citizen by his fellow-citizens is something that has been won by too much sacrifice and too much pain to be surrendered to any Party or any Government, no matter whether that Government calls itself a Cumann na nGaedheal, Labour Government,   or Republican Government. No government has a right to do that until it has proved sufficiently to the people that there is a national danger. I claim that the President has not made any such case.  He has not made a case next or near to satisfying any person who takes an unprejudiced and unbiased view of the situation.  I suggest to him that if he wants to intern anybody, or to remove a good deal of trouble and distress, he might find it agreeable to extend some measure of relief to those who are in distress throughout the country.  Probably the provision of internment that he has in mind is the internment of the unemployed to get rid of that problem. 
     
      
       I should, on the whole, thank the Dail for the way in which this measure has been received. I think that the manner of its reception will be a distinct advantage in the present emergency.  I am not at all impressed with a couple of rather hysterical statements that were made in connection with this measure.  In the first place, here in the Dail there will be an opportunity at all times to deal with any Government which would abuse the powers given under this Bill, and it must be borne in mind that while various enactments have been passed by the Oireachtas in pursuance of the policy of the Government to give a democratic character to our institutions, we have endeavoured to ensure to the citizens of the State the fullest measure of liberty.  In the Constitution are found safeguards for the liberty of the citizens.  Those who endeavour to endanger that liberty so definitely guaranteed must be shown that that which has been dearly bought and dearly prized will be stoutly defended. Every servant of the State doing his duty properly and conscientiously is entitled to the fullest support of the institutions of the State. Persons endeavouring by violence to interrupt the normal life of the State, and to hinder, assail, or terrorise it by wounding or murdering State servants will find that the resources of the State, will be employed to counteract and defeat them. 
     
     
        It must be always the duty of the Government to see that activists engaged in efforts to overthrow the State by violence will be met by the full authority of the State derived from the people as a whole.  The State has had to encounter much more formidable attacks than these, and it is not likely to succumb to any conspiracy which a few desperadoes are capable of, but we must take precautions.  We must make the unarmed police feel that we will not tolerate armed attacks on them, and that we will take all measures necessary to preserve public peace.  The lives and property of State servants are in jeopardy, and have been in jeopardy.  Their rights and property have been taken.  I feel that we are not taking much power under this.  What are the powers we are taking?  To interfere with the liberty of a certain number of people who are definitely set upon upsetting social order in the State.  What is the order in the State that is being upset? That which has been established by the Oireachtas it is our duty to safeguard. In looking over the whole world's history, as we know it, we find that in certain cases where it was abused very much more drastic measures were taken to correct abuses.  This is not a drastic measure of correcting abuse. It is a particularly mild method, and the same method was not adopted by the people against whom we are now seeking to take these powers in their policy, so that we are actually meeting all sorts of excesses by a simple interruption of liberty, an interruption of liberty which is being used and utilised to subvert the State.  These measures cannot be taken by the Government without proclamation.  The Oireachtas is in possession and must be in possession of the reasons which bring about that proclamation, and the Executive has got to stand the natural criticism which will flow from any possible abuse there might be of this Bill, which we hope will become an Act. 
     We will suppose for a moment that we adjourn for the Christmas Recess without this measure, in the light of what has happened.  If I know anything about these people they will give   attention to the reply that is given by the State to any attack by them.  If we adjourn for Christmas without this measure and we meet with another experiment such as has happened, what will our answer be to that experiment? The Oireachtas is summoned and is asked for powers such as these and by reason of that people's minds are disturbed. I do not personally think there is any danger to the State in the attacks which have been made.  I feel perfectly confident that the State has been established on sure foundations, but I feel that it would be unwise, in view of the people with whom we are dealing, to delay any length of time in giving the Executive such power as we are seeking under this measure. It is not intended to intern a large number of people.  It is not intended to intern our political opponents.  I can assure the Deputy of that. 
     
      
       Even if they commit crime? 
     
     
      
       It is intended to intern persons responsible for the conspiracy of which I gave a short outline this evening. 
     
     
      
       You must have them picked out already. 
     
     
      
       We have.  It is quite possible that we will not increase the number we have in custody already by fifty per cent.  It is quite possible that we will not hold all we have.  I say that I do not attach undue importance to the activities of the last six or twelve months and I am sure Deputy Gorey will be pleased to hear that information has been pouring in from sources which nobody would believe it would come from, within the last few years.  There is certainly growing up a civic spirit.  I would not, at all, be surprised but that the reason for this attack is that there is so much information coming in and that we have been able to check a good many abuses and that we are getting possession of the guns.  In answer to Deputy Hogan I say that I would much prefer to go before the electorate and say that after my four or five years' administration, it was never necessary   to introduce such a measure as this. I would feel far easier and I would feel far more confident in making an appeal for my return, but I am not ashamed to stand behind the measure, to defend it, and say to the people, &ldquo;No steps did we neglect to take to ensure that your lives, your liberties and your property were secure.&rdquo; 
       Question put and declared carried. 
       A division was called for. 
     
     
      
       How many Deputies claim a division? 
       Deputies P. Hogan (An Clar) and Lyons rose. 
     
     
      
       We will record the fact that Deputy Lyons and Deputy Hogan are dissenting from the Second Reading.  When will the Committee Stage be taken? 
     
     
      
       I propose to take the Committee and remaining Stages to-morrow, if the House will agree, and in answer to Deputy Johnson, I would agree, at six o'clock to-morrow evening, granted that this measure is out of the way, to take his motion.  If not, I will move to sit late. 
     
     
      
       What does the President propose in regard to amendments to the Bill? 
     
     
      
       In regard to amendments to the Bill, there is power for the Chair to take amendments in Committee without notice. Really, if this Bill is taken in Committee to-morrow, amendments must be taken without notice, provided, of course, they are in order. 
     
     
      
       I would like to put a point to the President.  The Bill may require more alteration than could be effected without care and on short notice, but I would like to put it to the President that what he desires from this Bill can be accomplished without making it a permanent provision of the law; that is to say, in effect, to leave out Part I. of the Bill.  If there is at this moment a state of emergency and you require the powers   that you are seeking, take them for twelve months, but do not give a succeeding Government, say a Labour Government, the power to intern people indefinitely. 
     
     
      
       I gave that matter the most careful possible consideration, and I do say that in my judgment the bringing in of a measure such as this disturbs public confidence and upsets people.  I am satisfied from what I have seen, from my own experience of public life, that a measure such as this will not be abused by any Government that you are likely to have within the next twenty years.  In the first place, we have to consider the strength that would be behind the Government. No Government would be sufficiently strong to override the opinions of the people.  If we have learned one thing during the last four years that we have been sitting here, we have learned that people who were violently opposed, politically and otherwise, have come to see that the disputes that took place between them were the lesser percentage of the whole.  There is 50 per cent.  of agreement on questions in this country between all parties, and it is only on a smaller percentage than that that there is disagreement.  We will suppose for a moment that at the end of twelve months there will be no necessity to utilise this measure, but that some incidents occur later which would make necessary the introduction of a Bill such as this.  That Bill would be introduced and public opinion would be shaken.  If the Deputy were in possession of the information   on matters of that kind which is in the hands of the Government, I am sure he would not need any persuasion to convince him that public confidence is very easily shaken and upset, and that the smaller the number of measures that have to be put through the Oireachtas in order to ensure public safety, the better.  I am as satisfied as I can be that, within twenty years, at any rate, there will not be abuse of this measure. 
     
     
      
       This is not strictly an occasion for a discussion, but it may save trouble to-morrow.  There is a point that I would impress upon the President.  He has emphasised the fact that under the Bill, after a proclamation has been issued, Parliament has to be called together.  The very fact that a proclamation is issued will have just as disturbing an effect upon the public mind as the introduction of a special Bill.  Then, once the powers have been secured, once the proclamation has been made and Parliament has been called together and has adjourned, the powers of continued internment remain and there may be no Parliament sitting. 
     
     
      
       The Parliament will surely assemble within three months. 
     
     
      
       Not necessarily. 
       Committee Stage fixed for Thursday, November 18th. 
       The Dail adjourned at 7.40 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, November 18th.
