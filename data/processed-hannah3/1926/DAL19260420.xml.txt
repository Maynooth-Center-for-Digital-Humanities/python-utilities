     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CONSTRUCTION OF RAILWAY ROLLING STOCK. 
     
      
       asked the President whether he is aware that a large number of employees who were for years engaged on Irish railways building waggons and carriages are now unemployed; if he will cause enquiries to be made into the placing of orders in British workshops for waggons, engines and carriages for Irish railways; if he will state whether any Irish orders are at present being undertaken by British firms, and if he can take any steps to prevent this work leaving the Saorstat whilst men are unemployed, plant and machinery idle, and workshops available. 
     
     
      
       , replying: It is the fact that a substantial number of railway shopmen are unemployed, the main cause being the falling off in traffic and the consequent necessity for economy. I am informed that no orders for either waggons, engines or carriages have been placed outside this country.  The Great Northern Railway, which does not build engines, has not bought any for 18 months, while the Great Southern Railway has not ordered any for a longer time, though it has in some cases imported parts of engines manufactured during the war and sold at exceptionally low prices. 
     
     
        So far as I am aware, no orders by any Irish Railway Company are at present being undertaken by firms in Great Britain or any other country.  I understand that some Pullman coaches are being built in Great Britain for use on the Irish railways, but the Deputy will appreciate that such proprietary coaches are not owned by the railway company but by the Pullman Company which pays for the right to put them on the railway. 
     As I have no evidence that any work is improperly or unreasonably leaving the Saorstat, there is at present no case for taking any such special steps as are suggested. 
     
      
       Will the Minister state whether coaches to replace the Pullman car coaches could not be built in Ireland? 
     
     
      
       The question there arises: Are the company to be allowed to have Pullman coaches or not?  If they are, you cannot insist on replacing these coaches by other vehicles. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister state approximately the number of men who will be displaced as a result of the information contained in the answer arising out of what he attributes to alleged depression in trade? 
     
     
      
       No men have been dismissed arising out of anything alleged in the question. 
     
     
      
       That is the result of amalgamation. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - APPEALS AGAINST COMPENSATION AWARDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister   for Finance whether he can state the number of cases in which the Department of Finance appealed against awards for compensation for damage to property granted in the Circuit Courts in the financial years 1924-25, and 1925-26 respectively, together with the number of cases in which the original decree was confirmed; the total amount of reductions made in decrees, and the legal costs incurred by the Department in connection with these appeals in each of these years, and if he will further state the number of cases in which no appeal was taken. 
     
     
      
       Considerable labour would be involved in securing information to enable the Minister to reply to the Deputy's question in its present form.  The following figures, which are approximately correct, cover most of the points raised:&mdash; 
       (1)  The total number of appeals lodged to date against decrees by County Court Judges and Circuit Judges is 611, of which 63 are still outstanding.  Of the 548 appeals disposed of, 110 were withdrawn after consideration by the Department of Finance and 68 were settled by agreement with applicants.  The number of appeals actually pursued to a hearing was thus 370.  The percentage of cases in which an appeal was made and pursued to a hearing is accordingly less than five; 
       (2)  The number of cases in which the amounts of the original decrees were affirmed is 155; 
       (3)  The aggregate amount of reductions on appeal totalled £81,481, including reductions amounting to £7,355, which were effected by agreement with applicants; 
       (4)  The aggregate amount of costs and expenses awarded against the Department on appeal, after deducting costs and expenses awarded against applicants, is £4,156.  Costs in some of these cases have not yet been taxed; 
       (5)  The number of decrees against which no appeal was lodged is 7,300. 
     
     
     
      
       Do I gather from the President's answer that on the whole the amount of costs awarded against the Minister is equalled by the amounts by which the decrees were reduced? 
     
     
      
       No; the total amount of reductions on appeal totalled £81,000. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - DRUM COMOGUE (LIMERICK) DRAINAGE SCHEME. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether a petition in respect to drainage under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, at Drum Comogue, Co. Limerick, was adopted by the Limerick County Council and forwarded to the Board of Works for approval, and, if so, whether he will expedite the making of enquiries by the Board of Works with a view to the adoption of the petition so that unemployment at Drum Comogue will be relieved by the work involved in carrying out the scheme. 
     
     
      
       A petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in respect of a scheme for Drum Comogue, Co. Limerick, has been received by the Commissioners of Public Works, and arrangements will be made to have the proposed district inspected and reported on by an engineer in due course.  Owing to the large number of petitions (352) already received, and the preliminary steps necessary under the Act in each case, it may be taken that even if the scheme proceeds no actual work can be started in this district during the current year. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CLAIM FOR SEIZED MOTOR. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a claim by Madame Maud Gonne McBride in respect of a motor car which was seized by British military in September, 1920, has been refused, whilst it is alleged that many similar claims have been paid, and if he will state the reasons for refusing to sanction the recommendation of the Commission in this case. 
     
     
     
      
       The claim referred to by the Deputy was considered by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission and decided by them to be outside the scope of their terms of reference.  Provision had been made that cases which were technically outside the terms of reference, but which were deserving of compassionate treatment, would not be definitely ruled out by the Commission, but would be reserved for discussion with the Department of Finance.  In connection with the claim in question the Commission did, in fact, make a recommendation to the Department, but the Minister was unable to agree that the case was one in which any ex gratia payment should be made from the funds of the Saorstat. 
     
     
      
       Will the President state why the recommendations of the Commission have not been carried out in this case, in view of the fact that the President and the Minister were members of the Association that used the car at the time?  Will he say whether it is fair or just that the Minister should now use his power to prevent this lady getting proper compensation? 
     
     
      
       I cannot answer the Deputy. 
     
     
      
       Had her political opinions anything to do with that? 
     
     
      
       I cannot answer that question.  If the Deputy will put down a question to the Minister he will probably get an answer. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - BROADCASTING STATION APPOINTMENTS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that an advertisement was issued inviting applications for the posts of Assistant Station Director, and Woman Organiser, at the Wireless Broadcasting Station; whether applicants for these posts were called upon to appear before a Selection Board appointed by the Civil Service Commissioners, and to pay a fee of 7s. 6d. in respect of each application; whether he is aware that on the 24th March candidates for the   posts were informed by the Civil Service Commission that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did not propose to make any appointments to these posts, and whether, in view of the fact that applications were invited for posts which it was subsequently decided not to fill, he will cause the fees paid by candidates to be returned to them. 
     
     
      
       The Minister is aware of the circumstances referred to in the question, and he has given directions for the refund to the candidates of the fees paid by them. 
     
     
      
       Could the President tell us what cost was incurred by the State in advertising those posts and holding those interviews, and whether it will be possible to take steps to prevent advertisements being issued for posts which subsequently may not be filled? 
     
     
      
       I would like if the Deputy would put that question to the Minister for Finance. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ENTERTAINMENT TAX AT COURSING MEETINGS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether representation has been made to him and to the Revenue Commissioners by the Irish Coursing Club, asking that all coursing meetings which are not carried out for the purpose of profits be exempted from the payment of entertainment tax; if he will state whether this tax was not enforced by the British Government prior to the Treaty; and if it is his intention to exempt such meetings from this tax. 
     
     
      
       Representation of the nature referred to in the first part of the question was made in 1923.  I would refer the Deputy to the reply furnished on the 12th June, 1924, to Deputy Micheal O hIfearnain in response to a question of a similar nature.  From the passing of the Finance Act, 1916, entertainments duty was payable by promoters of coursing meetings in cases where payments for admission were made.  During the disturbed period payment of this duty may not have been made, but the legality of the duty   was never questioned and exemption from payment was never granted.  It is not the intention to exempt such meetings from payment of the proper entertainment duty. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that such coursing meetings are not run for the purpose of making a profit, and is he aware that the entertainment tax was only imposed on such games or sports on which profits are made, and that in this case there was no money distributed except in prizes?  Will the President try to use his influence, if he has influence, with the Minister for Finance to see that this particular sport&mdash;the only old Irish sport that we have left&mdash;is exempted from the entertainment tax? 
     
     
      
       I would not like to answer in the absence of the Minister. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - P.O. STORES DEPARTMENT. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he is yet in a position to announce the date at which the revision of the manipulative staff in the Stores Department of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will be put into operation. 
     
     
      
       The revision of the staff referred to is still under consideration, but the Minister hopes to be in a position shortly to communicate a decision in the matter. I think much the same answer was given some time ago.  Complications have arisen in another Department having something of the same set of circumstances. Consideration of the reactions of any decisions in this matter could not have been attended to by reason of the Budget and other things of that sort intervening.  It is hoped that within three or four weeks' time it will be attended to. 
     
     
      
       Is the President aware that officers of a lower grade, while substituting officers of a higher grade, are receiving no allowance whilst so substituting, and in the case of higher appointments the lower grades receive a substitution allowance while employed substituting the higher   grades?  In view of this inequality will the President undertake that there will be no further postponement of the revision? 
     
     
      
       I could not promise it sooner than three or four weeks. 
     
     
      
       Will we have it within three or four weeks? 
     
     
      
       I hope so. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - NATIONAL ARMY DEMOBILISATIONS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence if he will state (a) the number of men demobilised in the year 1923; (b) the number who have applied for back pay, and (c) the number who have been refused on the grounds that they had not claimed before December 1st, 1924; and if he will state whether all officers and men who were demobilised up to August, 1924, were officially informed that any claim for back pay arising by way of arrears in and prior to 1922-23 should be submitted by them not later than December 1st, 1924. 
     
     
      
       The number of Officers, N.C.O.'s and men demobilised during the year 1923 was 24,452.  The total number of applications received for arrears of pay was 5,936.  These were disposed of as follows:&mdash; 
     
     
       
         
         
         
         
         
           
             Claims paid in full or in part 
             4,215 
           
         
         
           
             ,,lodged, but not pressed by claimant 
             1,011 
           
           
             ,,disallowed after investigation 
             704 
           
           
             ,,still under investigation 
             6 
           
           
             
             
             5,936 
           
         
       
     
     The number of claims received since 1st December, 1924 is 304.  No formal official notice was given to Officers, N.C.O.s and men on demobilisation that claims for arrears of pay should be submitted not later than the 1st December, 1924, but ample opportunities were afforded to men, both while serving and subsequently, to make application for arrears alleged to be due. The natural assumption is that claims having any merits would have been   lodged before that date, and, accordingly, no action was taken on claims received subsequent to that date. 
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that large numbers of men have been deprived of two or three months' pay to which they were entitled?  Is he aware that there have been applications and that the applicants have been informed, as their applications were not received prior to 1st December, 1924, they were not going to be considered? I want to ascertain from the Minister whether he thinks that is just, and if he is aware that these men have not been officially notified about arrears of pay?  Does the Minister think it is just and fair to deprive them of the money they have lawfully earned? 
     
     
      
       I think that anyone who was entitled to arrears of pay knew what he was to get and got it.  All who were entitled to pay have been dealt with and their cases settled, with the exception of six. 
     
     
      
       I am not satisfied at all with the reply of the Minister, and I think that the men who answered the call and took up arms in 1922 and 1923 are entitled to the full amount of the wages earned in the same way as if they were working for a firm, and they were in a more dangerous position&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is making a speech now. 
     
     
      
       I give notice that I will raise this question on the adjournment. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - PROVISION FOR DISABLED SOLDIERS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence if he can give the probable date or month on or in which he intends to introduce legislation that will enable compensation, pension or gratuity to be paid to men who served their country and are now suffering from tuberculosis, neurasthenia, mental trouble and other disabilities and loss of limbs through accidental causes whilst serving the State; if he is aware that a stereotyped reply is sent to nearly all such persons to the effect that as the injury in respect of which   a claim is made was received after the date of cessation of active service conditions the case cannot be considered under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, and if he is aware that many victims are penniless and are dependent on relatives for support and have not the right of claiming compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts. 
     
     
      
       I regret that I cannot say as definitely as the Deputy desires when legislation will be introduced to amend the Army Pensions Act, 1923. A draft of a Bill for the purpose is at present under consideration from the financial standpoint.  I hope to be able to introduce the Bill before the summer adjournment. 
     
     
      
       Could the Minister not recommend these men to some Department for compensation or some little allowance which will enable them to live without having to depend on their relatives? 
     
     
      
       There is no Department that I know to which I could recommend them, because there is no money devoted for purposes of that kind. 
     
     
      
       In 1924 I referred to several cases and I brought them to the notice of the Minister and always got the same reply. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that a similar reply was given on several occasions by successive Ministers?  Several Minister have been in office since this matter first arose. There is considerable distress prevailing amongst these people, who are obliged to live on their relatives.  Will the Minister give an assurance that he will introduce a measure sufficiently early to enable it to be passed before the summer recess?  The Minister knows quite well it is unfair to ask these men to continue their dependency for a further period and they are entitled to some relief. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister give an undertaking that a Bill will be introduced and passed before the general election? 
     
     
     
      
       A lot will depend on the frame of mind of the House. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister remember when he promised that a Bill would be introduced immediately after the Easter adjournment? 
     
     
      
       I think I said after the Easter adjournment, not immediately after the Easter adjournment. The matter is not being delayed in any way.  The Bill has to be examined. The heads of the Bill are perfectly settled and in order, but a certain examination has to take place in regard to the drafting.  As soon as that is done the Bill will be introduced.  No unnecessary delay will take place. 
     
     
      
       Is the Bill any more forward now than when the first answer of this sort was given? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       The President, in answer to a similar question, stated that the Bill would be before the House in December, 1924. 
     
     
      
       I am not responsible for the President's statement. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister responsible for the position in which these people are in the country?  They are suffering great distress. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister disclaim responsibility for things his predecessor in office said? 
     
     
      
       No, sir. 
     
     
      
       You accept responsibility? 
     
     
      
       I have something here which the Minister is responsible for.  It goes back to the year 1924.  It is a letter and it states: &ldquo;Mr. Hughes desires me to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 6th instant giving particulars of the following three cases in respect of whom applications are made to have considered in connection with the Amending Pensions Bill which it is hoped to introduce in the near future and to inform you that these cases shall have consideration....&rdquo; It is now 1926. 
     
     
     
      
       And it might go on until 1930. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ARMY STRENGTH REDUCTIONS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence if he will state the numbers by which the Army has been reduced during the financial year ending 31st March, 1926; if he will further state the numbers and ranks in which the reductions have taken place; also, whether any of those whose services have been dispensed with have received pensions of any kind, and, if so, if he will state the number and the amount of the pensions. 
     
     
      
       During the period mentioned by the Deputy, the numerical strength of the forces was reduced by 22 officers and 995 other ranks, making a total of 1,017. 
       The numbers by ranks were:&mdash;

     Of the men discharged during the year, two ex-privates were awarded temporary wound pensions under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, one at the rate of 16/9 per week for the period from the 8th May, 1925, to the 31st January, 1926, and 10/6 per week for the period from the 1st February, 1926, to the 31st July, 1926, and the second at the rate of 10/4 per week for the period from the 19th September, 1925, to the 31st March, 1926.  A wound gratuity of £25 was awarded to an ex-Sergeant under the same Act. 
     I regret that the compilation of details of pensions which may have been granted under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, would entail so much labour as to make it impracticable for me to furnish the Deputy with   the information to-day, and it is doubtful whether the labour involved would be justified.  I believe that the number of cases in which pensions have been granted is comparatively small. 
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that the number of cases in which pensions have been granted is comparatively small?  In the circumstances there should not be any great difficulty in getting them.  One does not desire to put the Minister to any unnecessary trouble, but I shall feel satisfied if the number is given. 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy so desires he shall have the number, but I could not possibly give it to him to-day. A great many cases are involved&mdash;over twenty thousand. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - BANK OVERDRAFTS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the amount due by way of overdrafts to the Banks by each County and Borough Council in the Saorstat, at the 31st March, 1926. 
     
     
      
       I have this return prepared. It would take some time to read it out, and I will, therefore, have it circulated and published in the Official Report. 
       The particulars asked for are as follows:&mdash; 
       
         County Councils. &mdash;Carlow, £1,677; Cavan, £316; Clare, £51,236; Cork, £29,305; Dublin, nil; Galway, nil; Kerry, £59,152; Kildare. nil; Kilkenny, £24,176; Laoighis, £24,215; Leitrim, £29,680; Limerick, £50,836; Longford, nil; Louth, nil; Mayo, nil; Meath, nil; Monaghan, £6,000; Offaly, £18,868; Roscommon, nil; Sligo, £25,625; Tipperary N.R., £14,596; Tipperary S.R., nil; Tirconaill, £67,651; Waterford, £35,588; Westmeath, £44,700; Wexford, £34,023; Wicklow, nil. 
       
         County Borough Councils. &mdash;Cork, nil; Dublin, nil; Limerick, nil; Waterford, nil. 
       Total, £517,644. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - KILDARE O.A.P. CLAIM. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and   Public Health whether he will state the reason for refusing to grant an old age pension to Mrs. Rose Keogh, Coughlanstown East, Ballymore-Eustace, Co. Kildare; whether this claim has been allowed on three occasions during the last two years by the Naas Pensions Sub-Committee; whether she has sent in affidavits from her god-parents, who are eighty-five and eighty-three years' old respectively, giving proof of age, and whether, as Mrs. Keogh has no means of livelihood, he will have further enquiries made with a view to awarding a pension. 
     
     
      
       The facts are substantially as stated.  The claims were disallowed on the ground of insufficient evidence to show that the claimant had attained the age of 70 years.  The last decision was given on the 24th of November last.  Since then no appeal has been received upon a fresh claim.  If an appeal comes in at a later date the case will be carefully and sympathetically investigated, and if necessary one of the Department's General Inspectors will be deputed to make a local investigation of the facts bearing on age. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister not think that affidavits from the god-parents are a sufficient proof of age? 
     
     
      
       They have been already turned down. 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister suggest who would be more likely to know the age of the claimant? 
     
     
      
       I understand that a Deputy in this House already gave some information of that kind to persons seeking the pension, and I do not believe it was acted on. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - RATES LEVIED BY CO. COUNCIL. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he can give a return showing the rates levied by the several County Councils in the Saorstat on agricultural land and buildings for the years 1914-15 and 1925-26, respectively. 
     
     
      
       I have had this return prepared; I will hand a copy of it to the Deputy and have it circulated in the Official Debates. 
       The following is the return:&mdash;

     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CASH ON DELIVERY SYSTEM. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he can state the number of postal packets delivered under the cash on delivery system in the Saorstat in the years 1924 and 1925, respectively, together with the amount of money collected on these parcels in each year, and the revenue derived by the Post Office therefrom. 
     
     
      
       During the year 1924, 2,858 inland cash-on-delivery parcels were delivered in An Saorstat. The trade charges collected amounted to £2,600, and the Post Office revenue to £130. 
       During 1925 there were 5,050 such parcels, the trade charges collected amounting to £4,500, and the Post Office revenue to £155. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - KILCOCK TELEPHONE EXTENSION. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that some of the work in connection with the new telephone extension from Kilcock has been very badly done, and whether he will see that the corrections needed, especially those belonging to the poles, are carried out as speedily as possible. 
     
     
      
       I am informed that the work in connection with the telephone exchange at Kilcock was not badly done, but it appears that one pole for a subscriber's line, which was placed in wet and marshy ground, was slightly deflected by strong winds before the ground had consolidated.  The pole was reset about a month ago and steps taken which will, it is hoped, make the pole more secure. 
     
     
      
       I have information from the afflicted person who has this telephone service that the poles that connected with his house were so badly put up that he had to send his men to support them, that when they were done there were more in the district that were not attended to, that men were sent down from the Department on two occasions to remedy these defects, and that there still remains some work to be done.  Perhaps the Minister will kindly look up the matter. 
     
     
      
       Certainly. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CO. KILDARE POSTAL FACILITIES. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that the new motor service between Kilcock and Coolcarrigan, Co. Kildare, obliges the people to post letters two hours earlier than under the previous arrangement, thus entailing considerable inconvenience, and whether he will look into the matter. 
     
     
      
       Generally the new motor service has resulted in an improvement in the postal arrangements of the districts served by it.  The dispatches are, however, made earlier in two instances by 35 minutes and 1 hour 15 minutes, but against that there are earlier arrivals at the offices affected by 1 hour and 15 minutes respectively.  In no case is the interval between arrival and dispatch less than six hours, and in the circumstances it is not considered that any public inconvenience can have arisen from the new arrangements. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - POSTAL FACILITIES IN CO. GALWAY. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state why the letters directed to Carraroe, Co. Galway, and the surrounding districts, are allowed to lie in Galway from the arrival of the morning mail about 11 a.m. on one day until 6 a.m. on the next day before being despatched, thereby causing considerable inconvenience to the residents, as well as to a large number of tourists who visit these areas for fishing and other purposes during the summer months; further, if the residents in these areas have sent a petition to the Minister urging that the motor services which leave Galway for these places at 6 a.m. should be altered to leave immediately after the arrival of the day mail train and return in time for the evening mail to Dublin, thus removing the inconvenience without incurring any additional expenditure, and if he will state whether arrangements can be made to grant this request. 
     
     
      
       The present postal service in the Carraroe area which works out of the night mail arrival at Galway   has been in force for many years.  I have received the petition referred to by the Deputy and in connection with proposals which are under consideration for the improvement of the postal services in the Galway area, including Connemara, I hope to be able to meet the memorialists' wishes.  The changes of services involved will, however, be extensive, and some months must necessarily elapse before they can be carried out. 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister endeavour to have these improvements effected before a large number of tourists visit that area, because otherwise it would cause very considerable inconvenience, as the Minister is aware, to tourists and others who visit that district during the summer months? If the Minister could see his way to expedite the improvements it would be greatly appreciated not only by the people of the district but by the people who visit it. 
     
     
      
       I realise the necessity for improving the service, and I will do my best to do so. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE PRICES. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he can state what was the percentage increase in prices of Irish agricultural produce, weighted and averaged for the year 1925, as compared with 1914. 
     
     
      
       Taking the index number for 1900, the basic year, as 100, the index number of the prices of Irish agricultural products complied from the average prices of thirteen Irish agricultural products weighted in accordance with their importance, showed an increase of 20.3 per cent. in 1914 and 84.1 per cent. in 1925.  The percentage increase in 1925 as compared with 1914 was therefore 53. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - TREATMENT OF RECLAIMED LAND. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if, in view of the drainage and reclamation   of land at present going on in many places, he will give directions to the Department to draw up a leaflet dealing with the after treatment of such land, particularly as regards the removal of rushes in the most effective and economical manner, to be available for persons requiring this information. 
     
     
      
       I do not consider it necessary that the Department should issue a general leaflet on the subject referred to, as the methods to be employed in any particular case would depend on local circumstances, and in view of the fact that advice and assistance in such matters is already available in each county through the local agricultural instructors. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - A RATHKEALE DECREE. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that Mr. John Stack, Receivable Order Number D.350/6, has been noticed by the State Solicitor that a decree was obtained against him at the Easter Circuit Court, Rathkeale, in 1925, for instalments due to the Land Commission on interest in lieu of rent; that Stack has signed an agreement for purchase since 1909 and has refused to pay as a protest against the failure of the Land Commission in not having his holding vested; that Stack attended the Circuit Sessions to defend the case but the State Solicitor made no appearance in Court, and if he will state when and where decree was given against defendant. 
     
     
      
       The State Solicitor reports that owing to the large number of Land Commission cases for the Rathkeale Circuit Court at the Easter Sessions of 1925 he foresaw that the Judge would be unable to deal with the undefended cases and he therefore applied to him to have the Rathkeale cases adjourned to the Limerick Court, following the course which the judge had adopted under similar circumstances at the Hilary Sessions.  The adjournment of the cases was announced in Court by the judge, and the solicitors concerned in the defended cases agreed to the course adopted.  The State Solicitor did not therefore attend at the Rathkeale   Circuit Court.  The Rathkeale cases and the County Court cases were subsequently fixed for hearing in June at the Limerick Court, the sitting was publicly announced, and, in addition, notice was given to the solicitors defending cases.  No defence was entered by Mr. John Stack, and not having entered a defence he was not a party to whom special notice of the hearing should be sent. 
       As regards the defence of Stack that his holding has not been vested, an agreement for the purchase of the holding was signed by Edmund Stack, and as he was dead the holding could not be included in the portion of the property which was declared by the Commissioners a separate estate under the Irish Land Act of 1903.  Subsequently letters of administration with will annexed were lodged and John Stack's name was noted on the purchase agreement as being entitled to the interest of the deceased.  It is proposed at an early date to include the holding in a portion of the property which will be declared a separate estate when the holding will be vested in the purchaser. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that the defendant, Stack, got notice that the case was to be heard in Rathkeale, while he states it was heard in Limerick?  Stack and others appeared in the court at Rathkeale, and they got no notification from the judge that the cases were to be postponed to Limerick. The only information they got was that the State Solicitor had met with an accident on his way to the court.  They went on the following day to find out if their cases would be heard, but they were not.  They got no notification that their cases would not be heard.  Further, there was another civil bill where the defendant was represented by a solicitor, and he got no notification that the case would be tried in Limerick, or in any other place. The fact that Stack's father was dead did not prove that the case ought not to have been heard.  There are other tenants whose fathers are not dead, and they are still not vested, after signing nineteen years ago in one case. 
     
     
      
       I would like to clear up this matter.  I am asked a question   about a specific case.  It is not hearsay. It is stated that people heard that the State Solicitor was sick, and that is stating something which I am not in a position either to confirm or to deny. It is stated specifically in the answer that &ldquo;The State Solicitor reports that owing to the large number of Land Commission cases for the Rathkeale Circuit Court&rdquo;&mdash;that was the court at which the Civil Bill was entered&mdash;&ldquo;he foresaw that the judge would be unable to deal with the undefended cases and he therefore applied&rdquo;&mdash;in court, of course&mdash;&ldquo;to him to have the Rathkeale cases adjourned to the Limerick Court.&rdquo;  That application was made in open court. 
     
     
      
       By whom? 
     
     
      
       By the State Solicitor. 
     
     
      
       The State Solicitor was not there, and he was not represented by anybody else. 
     
     
      
       I suggest that the Deputy put down a supplementary question challenging this, but I am taking the responsibility of stating now that an application was made in court &mdash;possibly I am wrong in saying by the State Solicitor; he might have got another solicitor to do it. 
     
     
      
       The other solicitors must be asleep then. 
     
     
      
       &ldquo;The adjournment of the cases was announced in court by the judge, and the solicitors concerned in the defended cases agreed to the course adopted.&rdquo;  That is surely specific enough.  It can be challenged.  But my answer to this question is that the cases were entered for Rathkeale court, application was made in court, in view of the fact that the judge could not possibly reach them, to have them adjourned to Limerick, and they were adjourned with the consent of all the solicitors who had defended cases. There was no necessity to send any notification to anybody who had not entered a defence.  It is never done.  If a man wants a notification of any steps in any proceedings he must enter a defence. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware   that another case was defended by Mr. Wolfe, solicitor, of Abbeyfeale, and he got no notification? 
     
     
      
       I stated specifically that the man did not enter a defence. I know that a man sometimes walks into court at the last moment and asks a solicitor to defend his case, but that does not improve his position, because he is then too late to enter a defence. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - LAND DISTRIBUTION IN TIPPERARY. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state on what grounds the application of Mrs. Julia Cooney, of Clonmaine, Donaskeigh, for an allotment of land on the Scully estate near Donaskeigh was not granted; if he is aware that Mrs. Cooney is a near representative of a tenant who was evicted from this property; that Mrs. Cooney has two sons who are competent to work the land if they received a grant of land and that they are in a position to provide the capital required, and whether he will see that Mrs. Cooney's application receives careful consideration when other lands in the county are being divided. 
     
     
      
       I wrote to the Deputy. Does the Deputy wish me to read the reply to the question? 
     
     
      
       I already had an answer by letter, but that answer does not cover the last point, and I think I had better have the answer to my question. 
     
     
      
       The Commissioners considered the application of Mrs. Julia Cooney, who claimed as the representative of a tenant evicted from the Scully estate, and in the exercise of the discretion vested in them decided that it was not a case in which they would take any action. 
       I think the letter went on to say that the eviction took place sixty-seven years ago. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister say that Mrs. Cooney's application will have consideration when any other lands are being divided? 
     
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
   
   
     QUESTION ON THE ADJOURNMENT. 
     
      
       I beg to give notice that, on the motion for the adjournment, I shall raise the question of the arrears of pay to soldiers demobilised in 1923-24. 
     
   
   
     LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME. 
     
      
       I desire to ask if the President would furnish Deputies with the legislative programme for the coming year or for that part of it which will take us up to the summer adjournment. I would also like to know from him the approximate order in which Bills will be introduced. 
     
     
      
       That is a matter on which I desire to make a short statement. Apart from the business on the Order Paper, there are the Budget, the Finance Bill, the Appropriation Bill and the Estimates.  It is proposed to take the Budget to-morrow evening and to move to sit late on to-morrow evening and on Thursday evening and to finish on Friday.  It is also intended to introduce a Jurors Bill, an Amending Land Bill, a Broadcasting Bill, an Army Wounds Pensions (Amendment) Bill, and a Rent Restrictions Bill. That, as far as I know, is the complete legislative programme.  There may be other measures introduced, but we would not propose to finish them.  I   would propose to take the Estimates on Tuesday next and would suggest, for the consideration of the Dail, that we sit late on three nights a week, at least, in order that the adjournment may take place a little earlier than has been possible up to this.  As regards the Order Paper for to-day, it is proposed to take the items on it in the order in which they are set out. 
     
     
      
       With regard to the statement made by the President as to the Bills which it is proposed to introduce during the coming session, may I ask him if we are to take it from his statement that it is not the intention of the Government to introduce any Bill to deal with the increasing amount of unemployment that there is in the country either by way of an Unemployment Insurance Bill or an extension of the present Act? 
     
     
      
       It is not intended to introduce any Bill to extend unemployment insurance. 
     
     
      
       Is the President aware&mdash;if the President is not aware of it I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce must be&mdash;that the number of people entitled to draw unemployment benefit is being considerably reduced?  They have exhausted their right to benefit with the result that the number of unemployed people who are not in a position to provide either themselves or their families with food is being considerably increased.  In view of that, are we to take it that the attitude of the Government in respect to these people is that they must either exist on air, or go on the rates, and that, as far as the Government is concerned, they are not prepared to make any provision for the relief of unemployment pending the time when we hope they will be in a position to provide them with employment? 
     
     
      
       I am not aware that the facts are as stated by the Deputy.  The Deputy has now gone from the question of unemployment insurance to other reliefs.  That is a different matter. 
     
     
     
      
       No, I am confining myself to that.  Does the Minister for Industry and Commerce deny that the numbers who are entitled to draw unemployment benefit are being reduced day by day? 
     
     
      
       Yes, I deny that. 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister then say how they are continuing to receive benefit? 
     
     
      
       By getting work, and by getting their contributions increased. 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister say in what way the contributions of these people are being increased?  Does the Minister mean to say that people who are not now eligible to draw benefit, people who exhausted their right to benefit, say a month ago, are being provided for? 
     
     
      
       I have already said, and still maintain, that the contention put up in this House and fostered by a certain section, that there is no work available, that once a man goes on to the unemployment insurance scheme that he must, therefore, remain on it, because there is no possible hope of his getting further contributions by reason of his getting work, is not the case. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister say when anybody from this side of the House ever suggested that once a man goes on to the unemployment insurance that he had to remain on it. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Corish is not here, but Deputy Corish and myself had quite a long argument something less than a year ago on this very matter. The Deputy's contention was that as there was no work and no possible chance of getting work once the stamps were exhausted, a man had no chance of getting other stamps to his credit. That I deny, and that is what I am referring to. 
     
     
      
       That was not the inference that I drew from the Minister's statement. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister deny, no matter how many stamps a   man may have to his credit, that he is only entitled to the maximum 156 days in the year? 
     
     
      
       That is the fact, but I deny the implication, if there be the implication, that a man must be without either work or benefit for the half of the period. 
     
     
      
       Many of them are. 
     
     
      
       Oh, many of them are, yes. 
     
     
      
       Could the Minister say if it is proposed to take Item No. 10 on the Order Paper to-day?  If it is not the intention to take it to-day, would the Minister say what date he has in mind for the taking of the Second Reading of this measure? 
     
     
      
       I desire to ask the President if he intends to introduce legislation to enable town tenants to get security of tenure in their homes, or legislation that would enable them to become the purchasers of their homes?  About eight months ago I was told the Minister for Justice was setting up some sort of a committee to deal with the question, and that he would introduce legislation.  At present a majority of the citizens of the Saorstat are suffering from rackrenting. 
     
     
      
       I understand arrangements have been made that item No. 10, Railways Bill, would not be taken to-day.  That is, I believe, the beginning and the end of the arrangement. It is my intention to take it up as soon as possible. 
     
     
      
       In view of the President's statement with regard to business from to-day to the end of the week, are we to assume that it will not be taken until next week? 
     
     
      
       It might come on on Friday. 
     
     
      
       In private members' time? 
     
     
      
       I have no intention to encroach on private members'   time, if there is private business on Friday, but there may be other time to take it. 
     
     
      
       I shall move to take private members' time to-morrow. 
     
     
      
       I wish to ask will the Rent Restrictions Bill be introduced sufficiently early to enable it to be passed before the present Act expires? 
     
     
      
       Yes.  Is there any date Deputy Davin would like to suggest for item No. 10? 
     
     
      
       If the Minister would agree I should prefer Tuesday to Friday. 
     
     
      
       I presume what the Deputy wants is that it should not be taken on Friday. 
     
     
      
       As a matter of convenience to the House, members should know when it is coming on. 
     
     
      
       Will the President agree to withdraw it altogether as it is unnecessary? 
     
     
      
       I undertake to put it down for Tuesday.

     IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - MONEY RESOLUTION&mdash;DAMAGE TO PROPERTY (COMPENSATION) (AMENDMENT) BILL, 1926. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;Go bhfuil se oiriunach a udaru fe aon Acht a rithfar sa tsioson so&mdash;

       (1)  The payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas to certain persons entitled to compensation, of an additional sum equal to one-tenth of the amount of such compensation, save in so far as such additional sum is payable by the issue of securities; and 
       (2)  Where such additional sum is payable by the issue of securities the charge upon the Central Fund and the growing produce thereof of the principal and interest of such securities; and 
       (3)  The payment from the Central Fund and the growing produce thereof of&mdash; 
       (a)  a sum of £150,000; and 
       (b)  an annual sum of £250,000 in every year for sixty years.&rdquo; 
     
     I presume the Act which implemented the London Agreement of December is sufficiently known and sufficiently recent to bring before the   minds of the Deputies all that is involved in this particular Bill now introduced, and that it is unnecessary to enter into any explanation with respect to it? 
     
      
       While it is no doubt true that the inferences and implications of the Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act are known to the Deputies, it has yet to be proved that there is any obligation upon the House to pass this motion or the consequent Bill authorising the payment of any sums of this kind within the present session.  The motion is intended to authorise the payment of certain sums under an Act to be passed this session.  That Bill has had a Second Reading, but I am going to ask the House in Committee to decline to pass this motion, the effect of which will be to make the Bill non-operative for this current session.  The reasons can be very easily and shortly stated.  The House is aware, and, judging by public signs, very definitely so, that the moneys available for paying to anybody this year should be husbanded to be used for more important services than have yet appeared to be within the intention of the Ministry.  There is a sum involved in this motion of £400,000 to be paid this current year, and I am asking the House to agree that there are other and more urgent calls upon that £400,000 than the call of the British Government. There has been no implication of any kind, so far as I have been able to find out by the Act which was passed last December or any other way, that we are obliged to pay this sum whether in honour or by legal obligation within this current year.  I think it is very unwise, to say the least of it, that we should thus, publicly and unnecessarily, indicate that we have £400,000 to throw away this year.  There is an obligation to pay this sum of money that is referred to in the motion, but surely it is quite a reasonable thing to say that when some of the other monetary obligations that came upon the country as a consequence of the pre-Truce and post-Truce trouble have been cleared off we might be reasonably expected to begin the payment of this £250,000 a year for 60 years.  I have   no other argument to use except the one so often used by Ministers and Deputies, that the money is not easily obtainable and that it cannot be spared this year when there are so many other much more pressing demands upon whatever money is available than this demand.  I, therefore, intend to oppose the motion, as it stands, and I hope the Dail will reject it. 
     
     
      
       I have an amendment here, but I understand it is out of order as it runs contrary to the principle of the Bill.  I suggest in paragraph 3 (b) to delete the word &ldquo;sixty&rdquo; and to substitute the word &ldquo;sixteen.&rdquo;  That would maintain, I contend, the principle of the London Agreement and still be in order on the Bill.  It would mean that we would pay a sum of £400,000 in the sixteen years which is just the sum advanced under the activities of the Wood Renton Commission.  Am I in order in moving that? 
     
     
      
       The amendment on the Order Paper by the Deputy is not in order, not so much for the reason that it goes against the principle of the Bill but that a decision has already been reached, owing to the passing of the Second Reading of the Bill, that arrangements will be made for the payment of the sums necessary to meet the obligations undertaken by the Free State under Article 3 of the London Agreement.  An amendment such as Deputy Johnson has on the paper for the Committee Stage of the Bill would be in order, but the Deputy's amendment on the Paper would mean rescinding our previous decision.  Deputy Connor Hogan is not precluded from raising the question in Committee.  He can vote against the operative section, which gives the money in accordance with Article 3 of the Agreement, and in that way he can accomplish his intention. Now, however, the Deputy introduces a new amendment which I have not seen before, and I am not able to judge the effect of it. 
     
     
      
       The effect of it would be still to remain within the London Agreement.  I pointed, on the   last day when this matter was before us, to speeches made by Mr. Churchill and Mr. Baldwin, in which they state that the total British liability would be five millions, and that four millions were transferred to the Irish Free State.  A further sum of £900,000 would, they said, fall due within the next few years, and they added, &ldquo;of course, we are retaining that sum.&rdquo; That means that we received about £4,150,000.  I am leaving a sum of about £150,000, as I maintain that no interest would be payable if we have to refund it.  I am willing to accept the implications of the London Agreement on the strict interpretation of the pact.  There was no suggestion that the money should be refunded with interest.  I contend that I am in order in moving the substitution of &ldquo;16&rdquo; for 60 years. It comes within the London Agreement. 
     
     
      
       It is not for me to construe the London Agreement. If the Deputy argues that if he owes four millions to-day he can pay it in sixteen yearly instalments of £250,000 he is at liberty to argue that. 
     
     
      
       The London Agreement does not say anything about the instalments or the total amount. It says that &ldquo;the Irish Free State shall repay to the British Government at such time or times and in such manner as may be agreed upon moneys already paid by the British Government.&rdquo;  The agreement has not been made yet, and we are to assume that the amount we will agree on, if Deputy Connor Hogan's amendment is carried, will be 16 times £250,000 plus £140,000. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Johnson has given a more admirable explanation of what Deputy Connor Hogan means than has the Deputy himself.  I am prepared to accept that, but I am not construing the London Agreement.  I am saying that Deputy Connor Hogan told me that the liability is £4,000,000 and that he proposes to pay it in sixteen instalments of £250,000. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps I might be permitted to raise a point of order against the amendment.  Under the London Agreement this sum was to be   repaid in a manner to be agreed on.  I am in sympathy with the amendment because we have such a dud Press here. I saw in a prominent newspaper some time ago that this repayment would amount to £15,150,000, and I can quite sympathise with the Deputy in assuming that that is correct.  Deputy Connor Hogan shakes his head, so he does not agree with that particular dud pronouncement. 
     
     
      
       The President will have to address me on a point of order. 
     
     
      
       My point of order is that there was agreement in relation to this particular transaction.  That agreement was between two peoples, and what the Deputy is proposing is not under the Agreement but something else.  I say that it is contrary to the Act which was passed and contrary to the Second Reading of the Bill some time ago. 
     
     
      
       That raises too many questions of fact for me to decide.  Are the terms of which the President speaks incorporated in any decision of the House? 
     
     
      
       In the decision of the House, as contained in the Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act, 1925. 
     
     
      
       That is subject to financial authority to be given later on.  Financial authority is not included in that Act. 
     
     
      
       &ldquo;The Irish Free State hereby assumes all liability undertaken by the British Government in respect of malicious damage done since the 21st day of January, 1919, to property in the area now under the jurisdiction of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State, and the Government of the Irish Free State shall repay to the British Government, at such time or times and in such manner as may be agreed upon, moneys already paid by the British Government in respect of such damage or liable to be so paid under obligations already incurred.&rdquo;  I submit that this is not the payment in question, and   that the £4,000,000 which, according to Deputy Connor Hogan's suggestion, is to be repaid in sixteen annual instalments of £250,000, is not the amount under the Agreement and it has not been agreed on by the British Government and ourselves. 
     
     
      
       I am giving leave to the Deputy to argue that thesis. 
     
     
      
       As I understand the President's contention, it is that the payment of £250,000 a year for sixteen years does not amount to £4,000,000.  It certainly is not a capital sum of £4,000,000, if you regard the money as being liable to bear interest, which I deny and which I have explicitly denied all the time.  I assume that this money is coming to us as a legitimate right.  On the Second Reading of the Bill I put that up, and the Minister for Finance put up the poorest defence I ever listened to.  I assume, as I say, that this money came as a right.  It was not as the result of direct negotiations with the British Government that that money was paid over. It was paid over as the result of an award of the Wood-Renton Commission, which was an independent tribunal, and its decisions were binding on the respective Governments.  I contend that it is not an ex gratia grant to us, but that it came to us as being strictly due to us, and that the tribunal only fulfilled its judicial functions in awarding those funds that accrued to us in respect of damage to property.  If it came to us as a right, why should it bear interest?  Who ever paid interest on a gift?  It could not be done.  The thing seems to be absurd.  It seems to me that the Government were so muddled, or perhaps so harassed in these days, that they surrendered to any conditions, no matter how hard or how difficult they might be.  Not alone did they surrender, but I claim from reading the speeches of Mr. Churchill and Mr. Baldwin, the offer came, in the first instance, from our Government here.  The British Government never asked for this interest.  In the words of Mr. Baldwin, they were offered by the Free State this interest of £250,000 and, of course, they accepted it. 
     
     
     
      
       They admit that themselves. 
     
     
      
       I claim that as this agreement was not included in the London Pact, but was evolved in another place, the Government, while bargaining, never, except at a belated stage, took the House into its official confidence.  I claim, therefore, that the Government let the country down in accepting the arrangement for payment of interest.  They should have known what the British principle was in the repayment of debts; but apart from that, they should have stood upon their technical rights.  Even if we did owe this money and if it was not an ex-gratia refund, was this arrangement in accordance with the principle of payment of debts amongst nations?  I contend it was not.  Our Government should have been aware of what the British Government were paying to America.  They were not paying 41⁄2 per cent., they were paying 3 per cent., plus 1/2 per cent. for sinking fund, and after that 31⁄2 per cent. with another 1/2 per cent. sinking fund. 
       I pointed out on the last day that we were discussing this matter, how the Italians had got off with less than half their war debt.  They were liable for £600,000,000 and they got off by an arrangement which means that in the course of 60 years they will pay £277,000,000.  Similarly, the French were able to make a bargain.  A tentative agreement was made some time back&mdash;not definitely ratified&mdash;for a payment of something like 121⁄2 millions annually for something like 62 years, which would only amount to £775,000,000. 
     
     On our agreement we will have paid. in respect of this sum, £15,150,000.  I also put forward the suggestion, and it has not been answered, that we have accepted a liability in this, for money which we did not receive, and that our Government has made provision to pay money that they did not get and to pay it with interest for the next sixty years.  The Government have not answered that, and I will prove that I am right.  We bargained with the British that they were to pay us over £5,000,000 which they did not do.  They   paid us something over £4,000,000 and they retained £900,000.  They never proposed to hand over that sum.  They retained it as a first instalment.  A capital sum at 43⁄4 per cent. interest would be in excess of 51⁄4 millions.  That is the position.  Therefore, it is evident that the Government did not seem to realise that this sum of £900,000 which the British retained was never paid and should not have been brought into the calculation.  That altered the claim in our favour, so that what we were liable for is what we received, and I contend that was, at the worst, £4,000,000; what the definite figure was I cannot say.  The Government can state the figure, but I contend this is the most we should pay back.  I claim also that it should not be interest and, consequently, I move the amendment which stands in my name. 
     
      
       The position I take with regard to this matter is exactly what I took up last December. If Deputy Connor Hogan has any misgiving about paying 15 millions, I will settle the debt now for five millions in cash. 
     
     
      
       We never got five millions. 
     
     
      
       Let us see what we got, or what we did not get.  As far as the position of the five millions is concerned, it contains two items&mdash; money received and obligations incurred. The obligations are still there. In liquidating this debt, the money already paid and the obligations incurred are together equivalent to the sum mentioned of £5,150,000. 
     
     
      
       What are the obligations? 
     
     
      
       Obligations running into sums varying from between £300,000 to £900,000. 
     
     
      
       What is the nature of the obligation? 
     
     
      
       Obligations in respect of awards of the Wood Renton Commission. 
     
     
      
       But we must meet them out of our own Estimates. 
     
     
     
      
       I do not understand that interjection.  The Wood Renton Commission was set up by agreement between the two Governments. It had to be set up by agreement between the two Governments. Neither one of itself could set up a body to make awards to be charged upon the other.  It was an act of grace on the part of the British Government to agree to its being set up and to accept liability. 
     
     
      
       Is it also an act of grace on our part to pay it back? 
     
     
      
       No; it is an act of charity. 
     
     
      
       As far as the repayment by the State of that money is concerned, it is an act of the Oireachtas. The authority of the Oireachtas is derived from the people of the country and the action of the Government in this matter has not been questioned in any part of the country that I have been in.  In any case, it is an Act of the Parliament of this State.  It was an act of grace on the part of the British Government to agree to pay their portion.  It was not in the Treaty which was made on the 6th December, 1921.  It was a subsequent agreement. In so far as the agreement is concerned, it was slightly extended on a request from us in respect of its terms of reference. In that particular extension, cases were brought in which would otherwise have been excluded.  In our compensation for damage to property we started on 11th July, 1921, as the date from which we were liable.  It will be quite apparent to anybody that it was better to have all pre-truce cases dealt with by one tribunal.  As far as the work of that tribunal is concerned, it decided the amount and it apportioned the liability, whether the liability was a British Government liability or a liability of ours.  I think we made it clear on one or two occasions that the British Government would not hear of any such thing as paying an indemnity to leave the country.  That, however, is past history now. 
     
     As far as this agreement is concerned, terms must be entered into as to the manner in which the money is to be paid.  It is a question of judgment   as to whether this is or is not a good method of paying it.  To a person utterly uneducated in methods of finance it would appear to be a much better thing to provide £5,000,000 and clear the debt.  I believe that it could be cleared for less than £5,000,000&mdash;for a considerable amount less than £5,000,000&mdash;for cash.  But I am satisfied that in the finances of this State, this is a much better bargain.  The question of credit comes in here in two ways.  It comes in, firstly, in acting up to the agreement we entered into in December last.  Any evasion of that would not be to our credit.  It would be damaging to our credit to attempt any evasion of it now, since we made that agreement in December and gave it the sanction of law.  The second way in which credit enters into the question is as regards what an additional sum of £5,000,000&mdash;or between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000&mdash;would mean to our national resources.  If Deputy Connor Hogan were to ask me what we could clear this debt off for, I believe I could reply that we could clear it off for £4,000,000 in cash.  But I am satisfied that it would not be good business to ask for a National Loan of £4,000,000 because it would take away that amount from the balance that we have available for operating in business and it would leave us liable for, perhaps, a heavier burden than this one.  My opinion is that another agreement will be necessary if this one be not acceptable.  It is no use saying that sixteen payments of £250,000 each clear off £4,000,000. There is a larger sum than £4,000,000 to be dealt with.  There is a sum of £5,000,000 involved and you cannot separate the two things&mdash;money paid and obligations incurred. 
     The position is not on a parity with that of France and Italy.  In the case of France and Italy there was a worldwide war to be considered.  It was in the interests of any rich combatant to induce the other nations to continue the struggle, and a bigger inducement than actual military support was necessary to do that.  Big financial accommodation was necessary, and if it were not forthcoming it might have meant an absolute defeat for one side.  This particular transaction occurred when   peace was made between Great Britain and Ireland.  These sums which they paid were paid in cash within the last two or three years.  That is not on a parity with something that happened eight or nine years ago.  If this proposal be negatived, then other negotiations will have to take place in order to arrive at what is written in black and white in the Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act, 1925. The sum to be paid must be paid by agreement between the two Governments. This agreement we have made. We believe that it is a good agreement. We believe it is a sound financial proposition for this State.  Altering a figure here and there is not going to relieve the burden of this arrangement by a single iota.  Accordingly, I oppose the amendment. 
     
      
       I understand from the President that the British Government is still assuming some obligations in respect of awards by the Wood Renton Commission.  That means that we are receiving into our Exchequer money for which the British Government is liable or was liable.  If I remember aright, the arrangement was that the Wood Renton Commission would make its awards, that we would pay the money and that we would be   refunded by the British Government their share.  It appeared from the Estimates that there were certain repayments coming from the British Government.  If I understand the President aright, the British Government will hand in approximately £900,000.  That would make us liable for £5,000,000.  But that £900,000 has not been handed in as yet.  We would not be liable for interest, in any event, for at least twelve months after the money had been advanced.  We accepted liability on 31st December last. The debt began to run from that date, and the interest payable on it would not be due in the present year.  Surely the British Government should be liable to us for some interest on that £900,000 which they are to have the use of.  The Government should have determined its present worth and got interest on it. I am absolutely dissatisfied with the Government's proposals in this matter. I think the House will be doing the country an injustice if it passes the motion.  It would be well worth while to re-open negotiations even if it entailed a vote of no confidence in the Executive Council, as rejection of this motion would necessarily entail.  The country would save itself millions by so doing.

     Amendment declared lost. 
     
      
       On the main question, I can quite understand that some Deputies who were very interested in the finances of the State could not bring themselves to vote for Deputy Hogan's amendment, in view of the statement of the President that a sum of £5,000,000 is involved and that sixteen times £250,000 would not amount to £5,000,000.  It may have seemed to some Deputies, therefore, that the carrying of the amendment would have been a breach of an obligation.  The President's motion is to authorise under any Act of the present Session the payment of £150,000 this year, plus £250,000 this year and for the next 59 years.  That obligation is contained in the Bill, and the resolution now moved is one making it possible for that money to be released.  The President assumes that the Oireachtas in the Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act undertook to pay this sum beginning this year.  That is entirely misleading. The Saorstat undertook no such obligation. The obligation that the Saorstat entered into was to assume all the liabilities undertaken by the British Government in respect of malicious damage done from the 21st January, 1919, to the time of the Truce and to repay to the British Government such moneys as they have already paid and undertake such obligations as they have already incurred.  We gather from the President that the amount they have already paid is in or about £4,000,000, and that there is another sum of anything from £300,000 to £900,000.  The agreement is to repay to the British Government what they have already paid at such time or times and in such manner as may be agreed upon.  So that the agreement is still to be made, and what is now in question is whether the Saorstat, speaking through the Oireachtas, shall agree to undertake the liability incurred in the manner provided in the Bill.  I am submitting that we can wholly and fully fulfil the obligations which we have entered into by the Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act if we begin to pay this sum when we can better afford to pay it than we can to-day. 
       I will not enter fully into that argument now, because the matter will arise later on an amendment when we come to the Bill&mdash;if we come to the Bill?  I am assuming for the moment that every Deputy who has spoken a word about economy, about the difficulties of meeting obligations, the difficulties of raising money because of the tightness of money, the over-taxation of the country and all the rest of it&mdash; that every person who has uttered one word in that regard within the last six months, is not prepared to say we have £400,000 this year that we can pay over unnecessarily&mdash;unnecessarily, I say&mdash;because we are not bound morally or legally by any agreement we have entered into to pay that sum this year. It is quite a reasonable proposition that we should not begin to pay it until we can better afford to pay it.  On that ground, I am asking all who have professed to call themselves economists not to vote for this motion, so that the Bill can be re-drafted in such a way as to allow for payments in subsequent years. 
     
     
      
       I agree with Deputy Johnson and I regret very much to see that some Deputies who went down to their constituents and cried out for economy had not the pluck to vote for the last amendment.  There is no use going to the country with one story and coming here with another simply   because they are Government Deputies and the Government says: &ldquo;You must vote as we direct.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Some of them can get off with it. 
     
     
      
       I put it to the President that the people of the Saorstat are not in a position at the present time to bear any burden in the shape of increased expenditure.  There are hundreds of people starving in the country at present, and if the Committee agree to pay to England&mdash;one of the richest countries in the world&mdash;£250,000 yearly for 60 years, or about fifteen millions of money, they will be doing something that the majority of the people would not agree to if their opinion was taken.  I challenge the President to put this question to a plebiscite.  For centuries England has fleeced this country by taxation.  I consider she has got sufficient out of it without this Committee passing a resolution to pay her any more.  It is ridiculous to put forward such a motion, and for the President to say that it is proposed in view of the agreement that was arrived at between the Saorstat and the British Government. It is no such thing.  There was no sanction whatever given by the Oireachtas to go to England and make that agreement. Such negotiations were never mentioned in either House.  The Committee should reject the motion, as the people should not be asked to bear such a burden at the present time. 
     
     The President stated that if he had four millions or five millions he could hand it over.  Did he think it a much better bargain to pay fifteen millions instead of five millions, and ten millions in interest?  That is how the rate-payers in every county in Ireland are being fleeced at present.  Their accounts are overdrawn and they have to pay, in most counties, from three to five thousand pounds interest to the banks on overdrafts.  The county gets no return for money paid in that way, all of which goes into the pockets of the banks.  The same thing applies in this case, giving England ten millions in interest.  To my mind England has got more money out of this country than she should have got, and instead of   paying we should request her to hand back some of the millions that she got by way of over-taxation. 
     
      
       I am totally opposed to the views taken by the Deputy who has just spoken.  We have a State obligation.  We made a fair and a reasonable bargain with another State and we have got to foot the Bill.  The President told us that.  Some of us have not gone into the details of this matter, but we believe that the result of the negotiations has been better than we could have made ourselves. For that reason we ought to be thankful to the President for his action. Deputy Johnson said that we should pay when we consider we can afford to do so.  I challenge that statement. Actually the Deputy will say that we will never be able to pay.  If we are not going to foot the bill the man in the street will follow, for no one, I think, likes paying debts to other people.  I think it is a very wise thing that we should pay this.  Although we may be poor now as a nation we will not get richer by repudiating what we owe, but we certainly will get richer by diminishing the amount of the debt we owe to other people, even if we do it at a sacrifice to ourselves.  We should face what we have to face and not be talking about what was due to us hundreds of years ago, or anything like that.  We made a fair and reasonable bargain, and we should carry it out, even although we may have to restrict ourselves to a certain extent. We should foot this bill and not be talking of waiting until we can afford to meet it, for if we take that view we might find we never could afford to pay.  Let us act like men and like an honourable nation. 
     
     
      
       Speaking as an economist who was an economist before some of those who now call themselves economists, as an economist who tried to reduce the Army Estimates by £89,000 when some of the most eloquent economists of the present time were voting against it, I want to say that in my opinion we should pass this resolution.  It is true and wise economy to defer contracting fresh obligations, but it is not true economy   to refuse to meet obligations when you contract them.  That is a disastrous policy.  We made a bargain. Deputy Lyons does not approve of it, but a very considerable majority in the Dail did approve of it, and we must comply with the terms of that bargain. 
     
     
      
       Would the Deputy quote the terms? 
     
     
      
       The bargain as far as I know&mdash;I am speaking from memory&mdash;was that in return for the remission of British claims in respect of the National debt, and not the war debt only, we should undertake the liability of paying an additional 10 per cent. on claims for compensation for malicious damage.  That is my recollection, but I have not the particulars of these claims, and I do not know if Deputy Johnson has.  I assume the Minister for Finance has put forward a scheme which will fulfil that bargain. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy, of course, is rather astray.  We are not dealing now with the 10 per cent. but with the liability for malicious damage. 
     
     
      
       I think we are dealing with both, taking the whole resolution.  That is not the point I propose to argue, as I have not the knowledge that would enable me to do so, and Deputy Johnson did not deal with that point either.  I want to deal with the broad effects of the rejection of this motion.  I put it to Deputy Lyons that he is, I think concerned on behalf of town tenants, and is anxious they should obtain the same purchase terms as agricultural tenants, but how is the Deputy going to do that, and how is the State going to do that, except by raising a loan as the British Government raised money for land purchase by a loan?  Who is going to lend the money if you say it is a principle in your State that you will only pay when it is convenient to pay?  To refuse to pass this resolution would be ruinous to national finance and credit and ruinous to national prosperity.  It would not be economy&mdash;it would be the most disastrous form of economy, and it would be the action of a defaulting creditor. 
     
     
      
       On a point of explanation, I hold that this money is not due. 
     
     
     
      
       Contrary to Deputy Lyons, I am assuming that the Oireachtas has entered into this obligation, and that it has to be paid.  I am not wanting to plead that it should be repudiated.  That is not my position at all.  My position is that the agreement we entered upon, which is referred to in the Bill which you passed in December, contemplated a future agreement as to when and how this money should be paid, and did not by any means bind us to pay any sum this year.  There is absolutely no obligation, according to the agreement entered into by this Dail, to pay any sum this year. Deputy Cooper might be absolved, but other Deputies and Ministers cannot be absolved, from the charge of inconsistency if I say that we entered into an obligation to pay compensation claims in the year 1925-26; but we see by the reports that £2,000,000 have not been paid this year in respect of these claims.  Was that a repudiation of liability?  No.  It was a postponement of payment to a time when we could better afford to pay.  Is that reducing our national credit?  Is it a dishonourable thing to have done? 
     
     
      
       Is it an intentional postponement, or is it due to the fact that the machinery is unable to discharge? 
     
     
      
       The Deputy will be as well able to judge of that as I am when I say that we were asked to vote in 1925, I think, £3,000,000 for compensation and only £1,000,000 odd has been paid.  One can assume the money has not been paid because it was not convenient to pay.  We may have other explanations, but I am assuming that it was not convenient to pay.  I am assuming also that that does not involve dishonour to the State.  There has been a postponement of the payment of other accounts without involving dishonour to the State, and we can postpone the payment of this £400,000 this year, because we are to assume we have got liabilities this year we will be able to get rid of, and we will be in a better position to pay next year.  There is no need to try and frighten the Dail by talking about dishonour and repudiation. That is not the question at all.   What we are asked to do in the Bill, and what this motion intends to make possible, is to pay this sum in this year 1926. when, as I say, we have no obligation to pay, moral or legal. 
     
     
      
       As far as we can see. 
     
     
      
       I am speaking of the Oireachtas and what has been done publicly.  The effect of the refusal to pass this motion would be, no doubt, that the Ministers would come forward with a new Bill making the payments to begin at some defined date in the future, or, if you like, an indefinite date in the future.  All I ask the Dail to do is to say we cannot afford to pay this £400,000 which we are not obliged to pay this year, 1926-27. 
     
     
      
       The plea for economy is on a par with some of the speeches, reports of which I have been reading in the Press.  It is no economy. It is not true to say that we postponed the payment of compensation through any act of ours.  If we made provision in the estimates for the payment of compensation we made it in the hope and belief that the charges would fall to be met in the year in which the estimates were presented to this Dail.  Not only that, but we took steps to provide additional judges in order to dispose of these claims.  We made every effort that could possibly be made to discharge our honourable obligations in that respect, and no attempt was made at any time to keep from any man payment in respect of a decree or award at the earliest possible date.  No definite step by a Minister, and no decision of the Executive, was ever taken to postpone or delay the payment to any person of a just debt that he had against the State.  In December last, when this agreement was put before the Dail the full facts of the payments that were to be made were put before the Dail.  The information was given to the Dail that the sums were to be paid in the order in which they are set out in this Bill.  Deputy Connor Hogan, when the Second Reading of this Bill was under consideration, contradicted that, I believe, and he subsequently admitted that these facts were before the Dail at the time. 
     
     
     
      
       Not from the Government; from an outside source. 
     
     
      
       From the Government, and the Deputy did admit it. It is on record.  It is in our Official Debates that the Deputy admitted it. If he seeks now to deny it he can do so. 
     
     
      
       I will follow you in a moment. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy has admitted it, and the fact is that every fact in connection with the repayment in all its widest details was placed before the Dail.  The Dail knew it and it passed an Act having the facts before it. 
     
     
      
       Why did not you put them in the Bill? 
     
     
      
       In which Bill? 
     
     
      
       In the Agreement Act of 1925. 
     
     
      
       For many reasons.  We could have put them in this Bill we have here now, but a Bill such as this has to be drawn with meticulous care.  The Deputy knows that better than I do, and he knows the senselessness of asking such a question as that. 
     
     
      
       I know that the words: &ldquo;In such manner as may be agreed upon,&rdquo; contemplates a future agreement. 
     
     
      
       It was not a future agreement.  The agreement had been made and the actual terms were read out here, and the Deputy knows it. Why should we undertake to pay ten per cent. additional to the Irish banks which were robbed?  They got compensation in respect of the money that was robbed, and why should they get ten per cent. additional?  There were other parts of the agreement that had to be very carefully considered to prevent anything of that sort happening. Bills are not got by pressing a button and saying &ldquo;We have got to get a Bill.&rdquo; 
     
     
     
      
       We thought they were. 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy were as well known throughout the country as in this Dail very little attention would be paid to what he says. 
     
     
      
       If the President were as well known to the Governments of other countries as he is here, they might not think so much of him. 
     
     
      
       That is a very intelligent observation, just on a par with the protestations of economy.  We are asked now to practise economy by postponing the payment of our debts. 
     
     
      
       No, sir.  You are asked to say that you do not owe England anything.  I did not ask you to postpone payment.  I asked a repudiation of the payment and I asked you to say how much money England owed this country. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Lyons cannot interrupt. 
     
     
      
       Why does the President misrepresent me? 
     
     
      
       Order.  Deputy Lyons must resume his seat. 
     
     
      
       I know all about this business.  The last day the President lost his temper, according to the papers.  I have no recollection of losing it and Deputy Connor Hogan knows it well.  The same thing will appear now&mdash;I lost my temper with Deputy Lyons.  I was not making the charge against Deputy Lyons that he wished to practise economy by postponing the payment of debts.  That was a charge I made against Deputy Johnson. The charge I have against Deputy Lyons is that he does not want to pay at all.  The Deputy stated distinctly that he did not want to pay this at all. 
     
     
      
       Quite so. 
     
     
      
       That has nothing to do with the question. 
     
     
      
       He has confirmed what I said to you, Sir.  That is the   new economy.  That is how this economy is to be effected, how this nation is to be an honourable nation&mdash; we are to pay nobody. 
     
     
      
       On a point of explanation I am entitled&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       The Deputy can make his point of explanation when the President has concluded. 
     
     
      
       That is an economy I do not subscribe to.  If you ask me do I like to have to pay this £250,000 for the next sixty years, I say I do not.  If you ask me do I consider it my duty to recommend it to the Dail, that it is an honourable obligation on the State, I say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  I am prepared to pay it, and prepared to bear the criticism of it.  I believe it is a good bargain, an excellent bargain.  I believe that it is a better bargain than if we were asked to pay four million pounds in cash.  To produce £250,000 a year as interest it would take, according to the terms upon which we raised the national loan, £5,172,532, and in paying that £250,000 per year you would take nothing off the principal.  I observe that the economists do not go into the question of how to strike a better bargain.  The opposition to this proposal has but two legs&mdash;one, the postponement of payment.  What does that mean?  Having our name written up as a nation that will not meet its obligations. Were these obligations before Deputies?  Were they in possession of the facts as to what they would cost the nation?  They were, and the figures were mentioned.  I told the Dail that we could wipe out the debt for less than five million pounds&mdash;for four millions, I believed, and still as regards the four millions I say this is a better bargain. It is perfectly within the competence of the Dail to say that they do not agree with this Agreement we have made, but it will be the duty of a succeeding Government to agree to terms &mdash;mark that.  There is one thing that must be borne in mind, and that is that the honourable discharge of obligations by a State, by a Corporation, or by any other body is the best evidence of their good credit and their good faith.  We   would, in my view, be liable to be indicted before other nations as a nation that has no respect for its obligations, and we would have no right to credit if we refused to carry out our part of this undertaking. 
     
     
      
       The President is fully aware of the circumstances in which the Agreement relating to the proposed repayment was ratified.  Let me jog the memory of the President. The House assembled at 3 o'clock on a Monday afternoon to debate the London Pact.  The President spoke that evening and he made no mention what-so ever of the method of payment.  I have searched his speech for any mention of the method of proposed payment. The Minister for Justice spoke the same night and told us that he had not a head for figures.  He made no mention of it.  He left that to the Minister for Finance&mdash;that he was not a man for figures.  I think these are his exact words.  The next day the Minister for External Affairs spoke and said never a word as to the £250,000 for 60 years.  On the following Tuesday the British Parliament assembled and Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Churchill were the first to give information, to divulge the truth to the world.  It was published in the Irish Press and that was the first intimation the Deputies had of the secret financial agreement.  Deputy Corish, who was the first to resume the debate on the Pact, raised the question, and the Minister for Finance, later on in the evening, about 6 o'clock, as well as I remember, spoke, and he gave the information that the President says was given to the House. I say this much, were it not for the fact that the British had given the information to the public it would not have been divulged at that stage. 
     
     
      
       Was it kept back &mdash;the statement I made when the Deputy shook his head?  Was the information given to the House?  Is it not a fact that the whole of the circumstances were mentioned on the Second Reading and before a decision was taken? 
     
     
      
       The information was given to the House when   it was no longer possible to conceal it. It was given to the House when the House had made itself familiar with outside sources of information, which is a different thing to making a candid and open confession.  No thanks were due to the Government for giving the information at that stage.  They could not deny it; it was not in their interest at that stage to do so.  Further concealment was no longer any use; it was no longer necessary.  It seems to me we are at sea as to whether we owe four or five millions.  The President says that we could get out of it for four millions. Some time back he said that the British were assuming some obligation that put the total liability up to five millions. 
     
     
      
       When I said that we could settle the matter for four millions I meant four millions in cash as against the present proposal.  I am not trying to mix up the Deputy as regards the sum.  Take as an example a man who owes five hundred pounds and there is a question of payment by cash or instalments; the cash payment always comes out lower than the payment by instalments.  I hope that is clear. 
     
     
      
       Not very clear. 
     
     
      
       I have explained the matter pretty fully and if it is not clear the fault is not mine. 
     
     
      
       Mr. Baldwin stated that they would retain a sum of £900,000.  Is that sum to be placed to the credit of the Wood-Renton Commission to be disbursed to the persons here? 
     
     
      
       It is a rather difficult question.  No sum of money is placed to the credit of the Wood-Renton Commission.  The Commission does not discharge any debts and it does not make any payments; payments are made from the Department of Finance.  The Wood-Renton Commission makes only awards. 
     
     
      
       That simplifies the situation.  I understood the procedure was that the Wood-Renton Commission made the award and we made the total payment but got a refund from the   British Exchequer.  I presume there is no payment in respect of any award of the Wood-Renton Commission which we have not discharged; I presume there is nothing in respect of that for which the British might be liable. Therefore, our Treasury must meet the deficit.  I cannot understand the President when he says the British are assuming some obligations in respect of damage to property.  The President never explained why, if this money is at 41⁄2 per cent., it entails a charge of a quarter of a million annually.  Surely, that implies that there is over five and a quarter millions due.  Any person can work it out and I cannot understand their method of finance.  If there is a cash value to the extent of four millions why is it that we are called upon to pay interest on a sum of five and a quarter millions for a period of 60 years? 
       Then again, why should £900,000 have to be taken into account?  I have asked that question and it has not been answered.  The British were liable for the sum of £900,000, but now they retain that amount under the Pact.  It seems to me that arrangements have been made to repay money that was never received.  That is a perfectly clear inference.  When should the interest become due on the five million pounds, if we really owe that amount? Is it to run from April 1st, 1926, or from the date of the London Agreement? It is difficult to follow the method of finance adopted by the Government.  Why should we pay any interest this year on the money?  I hold that no interest is now due.  Let us presume that the amount starts to bear interest on April 1st; in that event there is nothing due this year. 
     
     Any sum you pay to the British Government should go to reduce the capital liability.  If you borrow five pounds from a man and some minutes afterwards you pay him a pound, is that pound to be regarded as interest?  I contend that the pound goes to reduce the amount of the original loan of five pounds, and brings the debt down to four pounds.  The same principle should apply in regard to the London Pact.  I hold that this year our Exchequer is not liable for one penny interest.   If we pay £400,000 the capital sum should be reduced by that amount; that is perfectly understandable. 
     According to the secret agreement, we are to pay back £900,000, a sum that we never received.  We are first to pay £400,000 this year and in the two succeeding years £250,000.  The British Government will have the use of that money, and I submit that we are entitled to pocket the interest.  Nothing has been done in that regard.  We are not repudiating our responsibility in respect to this agreement.  Even if the motion of the Minister for Finance is delayed, the agreement ratified by the Dail last December still stands; but the further arrangement which they now bring forward for ratification we will turn down; not only that, but we should pass a vote of no confidence in the Government for its method of handling our finances. 
     
      
       I disagree with Deputy Hogan in regard to the payments.  I have already expressed my opinion that the people should not be called upon to pay anything at all.  I wish to emphasise that opinion.  We are not responsible for any payments.  I submit, further, that money is not lawfully due to England at all.  Instead of the Government, who are the directors and leaders of the people's representatives, to a certain extent, introducing legislation and getting it passed with the object of paying England a certain amount of money, it should be quite the contrary; it is on the other side of the Channel that legislation should be passed with the object of paying us the money lawfully due us by England.  That is my opinion, and that is why I said I would not agree to this motion.  If the Government succeeds in getting this motion passed, I shall not shirk my responsibility. I am prepared to go to the country and point out to the people that the Government they elected are putting on their shoulders a payment of fifteen millions, and I will indicate that that displays the Government's gratitude for election. 
     
     
      
       Does the Deputy think that will be good for the country? 
     
     
      
       It will be good for the country and particularly for contractors   and business-men.  If the fifteen millions are not paid to England people will be able to give more employment; probably there would be a big effort in the direction of building houses and contractors in the city will get orders.  In that way it may do good.  If this money were lawfully due I would not vote against the motion.  I simply hold that it is not, and that the agreement that was ratified clearly by a majority does not show that it is.  In his final speech on that agreement the President said if there was any man who was against the agreement who would have the pluck to say that he would work it if it were carried, he would like to hear that man.  He said there was no such man.  There were three such and I was one of them. 
       I voted against the agreement, but I was prepared, if that agreement were passed by a majority, to work it.  In that way I was prepared to accept it like I accepted the original Treaty in 1921.  I hold that it is up to every Deputy here to do everything in his power to bring down the over-taxation of the people.  By passing this Bill you are placing an extra burden on the people and you are compelling them to pay out of the Exchequer a sum of £250,000 a year for the next sixty years.  The President said if he had £4,000,000 it would be easy for him to get the debt wiped out.  In the Budget which will be introduced tomorrow we will have to raise something like £25,500,000.  Why not reduce that Estimate and pay off the £4,000,000?  Why not save that much money and then you will not have to borrow so much?  You can save money from the extravagance in every Department of the Government.  You have extravagance in every Department throughout the State.  The people I represent have had their wages cut down to a starvation rate.  The County Councils are told to economise. The President can save that four and a quarter millions out of the estimate and he can do it without causing one penny extra to fall on the State. 
     
     
      
       Has the Deputy   much support in the Dail for that proposal? 
     
     
      
       I stood here one time all alone.  I am prepared to stand here to-day alone.  It does not annoy me what support I will get so long as I voice the opinions of the people I represent. 
     
     
      
       On a point of order, might I ask the Deputy is he going by his own acts and deeds to show that he is prepared to set a really good example by refusing to accept any salary?  He has told us that it is the duty of all of us to spare this money.  I can quite understand that frame of mind if he will set the example.  If he is prepared to refuse to accept his salary and to pay his own railway fares, and be what I should then call a really high-class representative of the people, sacrificing himself for the good of the nation and take his own advice, that would be something that we could understand. If he does that he might go on and talk a little further. 
     
     
      
       Is that a point of order? 
     
     
      
       This question can come up on the Estimates. 
     
     
      
       I am quite prepared to do what Deputy Beamish speaks about if the capitalist Deputies who built their capital on sweated labour do likewise. 
     
     
      
       Why does not the Deputy say &ldquo;I am so noble that I will do this, no matter what any other Deputy does&rdquo;?  But the Deputy hangs on to his salary. 
     
     
      
       I would like to ask the President if this sum of money in question is included in the Estimates for 1926-7?  I understand that it is not. I want to put it to the President that he should state to the Dail exactly what he said on that point last December. My own recollection cannot carry me back to exactly what he did say.  I did not understand the President or any of the Ministers to tell the Dail when this London Pact was under discussion that we were to start paying the money   this year.  I question if any member of the Ministry or any one behind the Ministers or anyone in the Dail suggested that we were to start discharging the liability this year.  If there were secret arrangements on that point, I suggest that the arrangements were not disclosed to the Dail.  I have no recollection whatever that they were.  My recollection is that none of us understood that that financial liability that we were then contracting was to be discharged in part this year.  No Deputy who voted for that understood that he was voting for a certain liability to be discharged within this financial year. 
     
     I am in agreement with Deputy Johnson when he says that he read the Bill and gathered that it meant that a future arrangement was to be made by which we were to pay certain moneys. Deputies understood that that arrangement, while tentatively given to the Dail, first through the columns of the Press after the English Ministers had informed us what the financial agreement that had been arrived at was; and when those terms were given to us here and confirmed later by the President, there was no statement added showing that we were to start this financial year to defray portion of that liability.  The understanding then was that an agreement was to be made as to when payment was to start, and I understood that was a matter for final arrangement.  I understood that in the final arrangement between our Government and the British Government on this important financial question our Government would see to it that the interests of taxpayers of this country would be seen to and looked after as well as it was possible for our Government to do that work.  I do not think that even the President himself will say that it is well for the taxpayers of this country that this payment is to start this year.  The President told us a few minutes ago that he is not pleased that we have to pay this money.  He told us that he would rather that we had not to pay it.  We think, as a matter of history, that this was gratitude on the part of our Ministers, or want of sense, which caused them to come to the   decision that they came to when they volunteered to pay this money to England. 
     The President himself stood over that statement.  Now his point of view is changed and he agreed to-day that it would be better we had not to pay this.  He feels to the same extent as we do that the capacity to pay at present is not as satisfactory as we would like to see it.  I am not going to dwell any further on that except to add that I think it would have been very good work for the Minister in charge of making this arrangement, or for the Ministers who made it, if they had a clearer conception of what our financial responsibilities were to be in 1926-7 and to consider whether or not it would not be better for this country to make an arrangement to defer the payment for another year or two years rather than to undertake to pay in this year when the depression is as serious as it is.  I voted against this Bill.  I am not in agreement with Deputy Cooper, who says that a postponement of payment is a repudiation.  It is nothing of the kind.  I recognise that the majority have accepted this and that the State must accept responsibility for what the majority of its representatives do.  But whether the State should start to pay now or twelve months hence is another matter, and I think that the President would be serving the State better by urging on the British Finance Minister to consider our ability to pay at present and to consider if it would not be possible to make an arrangement that would be much more satisfactory to this country and little less satisfactory to what the President would style our creditor.  I would like to know whether it was decided when this agreement was made that we were to pay this sum this year, and if such a decision were arrived at why the House and the country were not told so before to-day. 
     
      
       I would like to correct the Deputy's misinterpretation of what I said.  If the Deputy thinks that I made this bargain in December and have since repented of it, that is not so.  I must say that I have not.  I believe it now to be as good a bargain as I did in December.  I believe it to   be an excellent bargain.  What I simply said, as an aside, and what I am sure the Deputy himself feels, is that I would like not to have to pay anything. I realise, though, that that is not the way in which business is done.  People must pay their debts.  I have just the natural human disposition not to feel pleasure in paying a debt.  The Minister for Finance said on the Second Reading of the Confirmation of Amending Agreement Bill:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;This Agreement will involve, as has been stated elsewhere, a payment of £250,000 a year for a period of 60 years.  As, however, at present the British Government is liable for sums of about £900,000 no cash payment will fall due to be made until 1st April, 1929.&rdquo; 
       That, I think, is not so much the circumstance to-day as then, because I understand some payments have been made since.  But the fact is the same; this payment was to have started and to have been payable as from 1st April, 1926, and that is the essence of the proposal. The mere physical fact of not handing out the money on a particular date is not the point; the point is the agreement, and the agreement says that £150,000 shall be paid in January and £250,000 a year after for 60 years. That is the agreement that we came to in December.  I supported that agreement then and I support it just as heartily now. 
     
     
      
       Is the President quoting now? 
     
     
      
       I quoted from what the Minister for Finance said. 
     
     
      
       Do I understand the President is quoting the Minister for Finance as saying that we would pay £150,000 in January, 1926, and £250,000 a year for 60 years? 
     
     
      
       No, I said the payment of £250,000 a year for a period of 60 years.  Then the Minister for Finance went on to say that as there were certain sums outstanding that particular first payment would not fall due until 1st April, 1929.  It did not alter the circumstances. 
     
     
     
      
       Did he say that it did not alter the circumstances? 
     
     
      
       No, but I say it now.  He mentioned £150,000 later in the same column. 
     
     
      
       Will the President contradict my statement that the House was under the impression that the first payment was to be made on 1st April, 1929? 
     
     
      
       Well, if the House were in a state of adamantine stupidity it may have been, but it was not.  The Deputy cannot have read this column 1590 of the Official Reports of 9th December, 1925, where, in the column after the one I have just quoted, the £150,000 is mentioned.  Let us be clear about what is meant; let us be honest with one another. 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       Is it the Deputy's opinion that if no payments had to be made until April, 1929, we were escaping liability for three years? 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       Very good.  Does it matter then? 
     
     
      
       Was not the obligation&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Let me deal with one first.  I want to put one Deputy right, and I will deal with Deputy Connor Hogan afterwards.  Is it Deputy Baxter's contention that if this payment had not to be made until 1st April, 1929, we would escape three years' payment of £250,000 a year? 
     
     
      
       You would be paying for 60 years, running from the date you started to pay. 
     
     
      
       Do I take it from what Deputy Baxter has said that we would simply pay £250,000 for 57 years? 
     
     
      
       No; for 60 years, beginning with 1929? 
     
     
      
       No, that is not the case.  The case is that the payments were to start from this year. 
     
     
     
      
       That was not stated. 
     
     
      
       The contrary was the impression that was created. 
     
     
      
       Well, if it was the impression it was a very innocent impression to gather.  The Minister certainly gave no grounds whatever for that.  Payment is to start as from this year. 
     
     
      
       The liability to pay, yes. 
     
     
      
       The liability and the payment. 
     
     
      
       It seems to me that if Deputies vote for this added ten per cent. they will be casting a reflection on the courts or, in the alternative, a reflection upon the House itself.  A Compensation Act was passed under which these cases were heard in the courts, and the judges awarded what they considered to be fair and just compensation.  We are now asked to agree to the addition of ten per cent. to these awards.  That means either of two things; either we are giving these people ten per cent. over and above what they are justly entitled to, or they were unjustly treated under the first award.  I wonder which view does the Government take.  I cannot see why these people should be paid.  By the mere fact of voting for this ten per cent. we are saying that these people were not justly treated, and we are either accusing ourselves or the judges of injustice towards them.  I want to ask whether the Government have, or intend, or are empowered to make any representations, representations which, by the way, they should have made at the time of this agreement, with regard to the treatment of the people who were victimised in the North and who should have got compensation.  It seems to me that there is a greater case to be made for the people who suffered in the North than for those who suffered in the South.  Those in the South, even if we accept it as a fact that they did not get all that they should, got something.  Many of the people who were victimised and burned out in the North got nothing at all. 
     
     Another point in connection with   this matter is this: We had this afternoon a question with regard to provision for the unemployed, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the President told us that it was not the Government's intention to make any further provision for them by way of unemployment insurance.  I take it that that is because the Government are not in a position to do so, that they have not the money or that they do not consider that the matter is sufficiently serious to warrant making any further provision for it.  I would like to know which view is correct.  We were told by the Government that the old age pensions were reduced because the country could not afford to continue to pay the 10/- a week.  We know that the same argument was put forward by the Government in fixing the wages on the Shannon scheme at 32/- a week and when they fixed 29/- a week as a maximum for work done on the roads under the grants. 
     It is an extraordinary thing if the Government of the country was so poor that it had to reduce the old age pensions, so poor that it could not afford to pay a decent wage to the men employed on the roads or to find money to relieve the unemployment and, in many cases, the starvation that exists, is in a position, apparently, to find a sum of £250,000 a year for the next 60 years.  That seems to me to be an extraordinary thing.  It seems extraordinary to me also that Deputies can come in here and support the view that this country cannot afford to make any better or any further provision for people who are unemployed and who, in some cases, are hungry, and yet can afford to make provision for a payment of fifteen or sixteen million pounds to England.  In connection with the 10 per cent., I want to stress that, to me, it means either of two things&mdash;(1) that the courts were not just in the awards they made to the people concerned, or (2) that this House was not just in passing this Act and tried to defraud them out of what they were justly entitled to. 
     
      
       I want to emphasise a few points in connection with this matter.  I feel that it is more   or less useless to attempt to point out reason to those on the opposite benches. The only reason they understand is the ringing of the division bell, and they understand that quite well.  It is the only reason they ever understand. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Duffy does not understand that. 
     
     
      
       I was seriously interested in hearing the President tell us that it would be a breach of faith and a breach of credit if we did not meet our liabilities to Great Britain immediately.  That was something to know: that we should not break our faith with Great Britain; but it is nothing, I suppose, to the President that he should not restore his credit to the old age pensioners from whom one shilling a week was filched some years ago; it is nothing to him. I suppose, that he should not do something to meet the unemployment problem throughout the country and restore faith in our people; it is nothing to him, I suppose, that there should be thousands of wretched hovels and houses throughout the country, and that he should not restore faith with these people; it is nothing to him that there should be a delay of four years in meeting the claims of disabled ex-soldiers, on behalf of whom it is asked that their claims should be met in a Bill immediately.  All that is nothing to him. 
     
     
      
       As regards disabled soldiers, everyone of these has been provided for. 
     
     
      
       The President is playing on the words &ldquo;disabled soldiers.&rdquo;  A man may be disabled through illness contracted while on active service just as much as he could be from wounds.  Punning on a word is not the way to meet a fair argument when it is put up here, and the President knows that right well. Therefore, if keeping credit with the people of this country means nothing, and if a breach of faith with Great Britain means everything, we must keep our faith with Great Britain and we must not keep our faith with the people of this country who put us here. 
     
     
     
      
       I would like to say, as far as some of the statements made by Deputy Hogan are concerned, that no unreasonable delay, no definite act to delay consideration of the last matter that he complained of, has been made&mdash;that is, as regards persons who contracted disease in our service.  No delay whatever has been made in that matter. 
     
     
      
       After two and a half years? 
     
     
      
       Yes, even with the whole two and a half years.  Nobody knows better than Deputies on the benches opposite that we get ten times the number of claims from people who have no proper legitimate claim to the one who will have a claim.  That has been our experience in other matters as well; that at least ten times the number of people apply who have no right whatever to apply to the one who has. Is it the Deputy's wish that we should have provided for the whole lot? 
     
     
      
       Will the President deny that he himself has dealt with cases of hardship that I have brought to his notice in this particular respect?  Is it reasonable to suggest that because the legal draftsman employed by the Government cannot successfully cut out people who have no claim that those who have a real claim should be kept waiting for a period of two and a half years? 
     
     
      
       It is not the draftsman's fault, because these cases have not got as far as the draftsman yet.  There are other people to be considered besides the draftsman. 
     
     
      
       Now we know where we are. 
     
     
      
       The draftsman gets our instructions as to what is to be in a measure, but the draftsman is not consulted as to the policy of the measure.  What I say is that we have not broken faith with these people.  No definite steps have been taken by any Minister or by the Executive Council to put the thing in a pocket and leave it there for so many months. 
     
     
     
      
       I say you have not kept faith. 
     
     
      
       Have not kept it? That statement is not true.  We have kept it, but we may not have been able to deliver the goods as rapidly as the Deputy would wish, just the same as a great many supporters of the Deputy do not deliver the goods to us as rapidly as we would wish.  Now we will go on to housing.  We have done more for housing than Deputies over there would ever be able to do, and the suggestion that has been made was not a very nice or creditable one.  With regard to the housing situation, we have done more in that connection, according to our wealth, than any other country has done.  Deputies on the opposite benches know that if they were here with the majority behind them they would not be able to do any more than we have done for housing, and possibly not quite as much. 
     
     
      
       It is very probable that we would not make promises that we could not fulfil. 
     
     
      
       We have made no promises that we have not done our very best to carry out.  Deputy Morrissey quoted this question of the 10 per cent., and said that in this matter we were passing judgment on our judges.  I thought I had explained at sufficient length to Deputy Morrissey before that there are two periods in connection with compensation&mdash;pre-Truce and post-Truce.  In connection with pre-Truce compensation an international Commission sat on the matter, dealt with cases and made awards.  It has been, I think, the experience of every person who has compared the compensation awards made under our Damage to Property (Compensation) Act and the awards of the Wood-Renton Commission, that there was anywhere from 10 to 30 per cent. of a difference between the two; that the Wood-Renton Commission gave that much more than was given under the Damage to Property Act of 1923.  That Act, as the Minister for Finance explained more than once, was tightly, very tightly, drawn. 
     
     
      
       By the House? 
     
     
     
      
       Yes.  By the Government if you like, and passed by the Oireachtas.  The Act was very tightly drawn and under it there were many cases of very considerable hardship.  I notice that one particular Deputy who very often attacks the Government and asks the Government for grants for this person and for that person, for people who have not been properly treated and so on, is not here to support this 10 per cent. although he knows just as well as I do that it was needed.  I have had representations from many people concerning this.  I certainly had one from a member of this House.  I had deputations from people in the City of Dublin whose case was a very hard one.  They went before the Court, and the judge decided that they were not entitled to foundations. The Corporation came along with the plans that had been lodged, and they insisted on the foundation going in.  In that case the judge was perfectly within his rights in deciding that the foundation should not be paid for and the local authority was perfectly within its right in insisting that it should be put down.  It was provided for and the ten per cent. in my opinion, would barely compensate for that item. 
     
     
      
       That ten per cent. would not have been given if it did not arise within the boundary crux.  The injustice would have been allowed to continue. 
     
     
      
       Will the Deputy give me time to repeat what I said? Pre-boundary crux, pre-disposal of Article V., the Damage to Property Act was something we could stand over and say: &ldquo;That is the utmost limit we can go.&rdquo;  Article V. has disappeared with its contingent liability, if any, and a general review of the situation was necessary, particularly in view of the fact that we were now going to shoulder for the first time the entire liability in respect to the Wood-Renton or the Shaw Commission awards, and the person whose house was burned after July, 1921, or whose property was destroyed after 1921 had at least the right to say: &ldquo;We are certainly entitled to be paid, at least at the same   rate as a person whose house was destroyed in June, 1921.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       My point is they might have said that and continue to say it, but there would have been no responsibility for the Government to add ten per cent. except that it is part of the bargain over the boundary crux. 
     
     
      
       On the President's argument there should be a sliding scale between ten and thirty per cent. 
     
     
      
       One cannot do that.  It can run from 10 to 30 per cent. I believe there are cases where 50 would be nearer to the mark.  It is not in the Deputy's mind, surely, that in order to settle this properly we should ask the Wood-Renton Commission to review all the cases that had been before the courts.  That is the alternative to it.  This is the best and most business-like method. 
     
     
      
       That is a flat rate of relieving injustice. 
     
     
      
       Yes, at least the Damage to Property Act was, as far as persons making an application under it, on a ten per cent. less generous scale than the Wood-Renton Commission. 
     
     
      
       The same thing could be said for the personal injuries. 
     
     
     
      
       I do not know whether the Deputy is in order in putting up that point.  I have read the Minister for Finance's statement again and I am perfectly satisfied from the reading of it that no other condition could be made and there was no other consideration to be arranged than that the liability should start this year. 
     
     
      
       That we were to start payment this year. 
     
     
      
       Yes.  The statement, with regard to no payments this year, was explained in relation to the sums of money yet to come in.  I think it is within the knowledge of Deputies generally that the Wood-Renton or Shaw Commission made certain awards conditional on reinstatement and on work being done.  Reinstatement awards are only paid on the work being done.  All the work had not been completed, but in respect to it certain payment had to be made, and there were book transactions as between the individuals themselves putting it forward to a later date.  Assume that the sum was five millions; that meant, say, three years' interest.  The sum was not five millions but a larger sum, and I cannot see how that misconception has arisen.

     The Dail went out of Committee. 
     Resolution reported. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dail agree with the Committee in the said resolution&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
   
   
     IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - DAMAGE TO PROPERTY (COMPENSATION) (AMENDMENT) BILL, 1926&mdash;THIRD STAGE. 
     The Dail went into Committee. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     
      
       I move the following amendment to sub-section (2):&mdash; 
       After sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
       (4) This section shall not apply in respect of any decree to which a full re-instatement condition or a partial re-instatement condition has been attached unless and until the Minister for Finance is satisfied that the said condition has been complied with in full. 
       I dare say that there is no necessity for me to argue this case, because I would hope that the suggestion contained here would be generally acceptable.  If it has been a condition of the award that reinstatement, or partial reinstatement, shall be made, then it should appear, I think, that that condition should be fulfilled before any 10 per cent. could be granted.  That seems to me to be an obvious proposition.  I think I am right in saying that the awards were not only for building but that conditions for the reinstatement of buildings were applied in these as in some of the awards under the previous Commission.  We know that in the previous Commission there were a number of reinstatement clauses attached which were not fulfilled, and there was a remission of a certain proportion of the awards as a consequence.  In some cases the beneficiaries got off very well without having to fulfil the obligations imposed by the Commission.  I think that in this case, at any rate, we ought not give 10 per cent. additional unless the reinstatement condition has been fulfilled. 
     
     
      
       I think it is fairly obvious that in any case in which a reinstatement condition has been attached, the 10 per cent. cannot be paid until the work is completed.  In other words, let us assume that the cost of replacing a destroyed house is £2,000. The Minister for Finance will pay £200 in bonds, but he cannot pay until the work is finished.  A contract may have been entered into for £1,500 or £1,600 and the entire cost may be only £950. On the other hand, although the contract was only for £1,500, there could reasonably have been extras amounting to £600. 
     
     In that case, he would have certainly no discretion but to pay the full two hundred pounds that would have been involved.  In any case in which a reinstatement condition is imposed and the amount is five hundred pounds or under it, the ten per cent. cannot be paid until the work is completed.  But take a much bigger proposition&mdash;a building costing £20,000 or £30,000, the contract having been entered into. I have heard of a case in which it would not have been possible to have gone on but for the ten per cent.  There it is obvious that it would be a hardship to hold up payment when the work was actually in progress and certificates were coming in regularly from the architect in respect of its continuance. It may be taken generally that where a reinstatement condition has   been imposed, payments will not be made until that has been fulfilled.  But it may be that some little elasticity is required in certain cases.  It would, I think, be a hardship to impose a condition in the case of an immense building that the money should not be paid until the work was completed.  The work being in progress and good faith being shown by the person responsible, I think that should be sufficient to warrant this payment of ten per cent. 
     
      
       Either I am misunderstanding the original Act or the President has misunderstood my case. Compensation has been awarded, let us say, in the case of a building and its contents&mdash;say, machinery&mdash;amounting to ten thousand pounds, with a reinstatement condition affecting the building alone.  The compensation is paid but the re-building is not gone on with and two thousand pounds for re-building is allowed to lapse. 
     
     
      
       To lapse altogether? 
     
     
      
       Yes.  But there is ten per cent. involved here in respect of the eight thousand pounds for the contents. 
     
     
      
       Might I explain to Deputy Johnson that no case has come under my notice of any lapsing of a reinstatement condition in respect of the Damage to Property Act.  Deputy Johnson has in mind, I know, some cases under the International Commission, but there are so many conditions which an applicant can select and put to the judge in respect of compensation under the Damage to Property Act that there is no necessity for evasion.  For instance, a huge house is burned down in the country.  The claim is made that the person concerned would not be comfortable down there and the desire is expressed to build a terrace of houses in Dublin. I have not read of a single case in which a judge refused to allow a transfer from a county like that to Dublin. It may be taken generally that any reinstatement condition imposed under the Damage to Property Act will be complied with by reason of the fact   that it is not confined to the particular class of building destroyed or to the particular county in which the damage was done.  In the case of the Wood-Renton Commission, the reinstatement condition applied to the particular place and, I think, to the same class of building. 
     
     
      
       It is quite possible that I have misread or misunderstood the implications of the Act, but I should certainly desire to ensure that before any ten per cent. is paid upon the contents of a building, some re-building has actually commenced in respect of the amount to which the reinstatement clause applied.  No case of this kind, the President says, has come under his notice, but cases may have occurred which did not come under his notice.  As the President has reminded the House, the idea involved in this amendment arises from the omission of such a compulsory clause under the previous arrangement.  I want to prevent the possibility that people will get this ten per cent. additional on the amount awarded in respect of machinery and contents of a building and not use the remainder of their award in respect of the re-building, there or somewhere else.  This particular form of amendment may not suit the special circumstances, but I would like to get some assurance that it is not merely unlikely, but impossible, for any person to get this ten per cent. on the contents of a building in respect of which a reinstatement condition has been made, that condition not being at the time fulfilled in any way. 
     
     
      
       To my mind, it would be very bad business on the part of a person who had got a decree, with a reinstatement condition, not to go on with the work, in view of the advantages. In a small case in which, let us say, there was a five hundred pound award for a building which would cost eight hundred pounds or a thousand pounds, the applicant not having the extra money to go on with the work, there should, I think, be more consideration shown than in the case of an award for ten thousand pounds for work which would cost ten thousand five hundred or eleven thousand   pounds.  I am fairly well satisfied, from the way the Damage to Property Act was drawn, that there is no likelihood of the same set of circumstances arising as arose out of the Wood-Renton or Shaw Commission in which a person might elect to take all the advantage and leave the site behind, with a building condition attached to it and a sum of money wrapped up which could be used for no other purpose. I am satisfied from the information I have had from the Departmeit that putting in a clause of this description might delay certain payments which it would be inadvisable to delay.  Having brought the Act before the House, having a knowledge of the way it was drawn, knowing that it gave every facility for other classes of buildings, knowing that in the case of a large building partially destroyed it gave to the applicant the entire cost of the re-conditioning of the building, I think this Damage to Property Act, 1923, is in an entirely different category from the Wood-Renton Commission.  What Deputy Johnson had in mind is as secure as it is possible to make it by legality and in view of the restrictions that might arise, I would ask him not to press his amendment. 
     
     
      
       In view of the President's explanation, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
       Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 6. 
     
     (1)  For discharging the liability assumed by the Irish Free State by Article 3 of the Agreement made on the 3rd day of December, 1925, between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State amending and supplementing the Treaty of 1921 and also for making the repayments to the British Government agreed by the said Article to be made by the Government of the Irish Free State, there shall be charged on the Central Fund and the growing produce thereof and paid thereout to the British Government   the following sums at the following times, that is to say:&mdash; 
     (a)  a sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds payable immediately on the passing of this Act, and 
     (b)  an annual sum of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds payable on the 1st day of April in every year for sixty years commencing with the year 1926. 
     (2)  Whenever by agreement between the Minister for Finance and the British Government any sum or part of a sum payable under this section to the British Government is set-off against an equal amount payable by the British Government to the Government of Saorstat Eireann, the amount so set-off shall cease to be charged on and shall not be paid out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof. 
     
      
       I move amendment 2:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (1), lines 57 to 61, to delete clauses (a) and (b) and substitute the following:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(a)  a sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds payable on such date as Dail Eireann may determine by resolution declaring that the payment of the said sum may be made without imposing an undue burden upon the finances of Saorstat Eireann; 
       (b)  an annual sum of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds payable on the first day of April in every year for sixty years commencing with the year next following that in which the aforesaid sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds becomes payable.&rdquo; 
     
     I do not propose to detain the Dail very long in arguing in favour of this amendment.  The case has been, more or less, discussed already, but the fact remains that, in my opinion, the Dail should not pass this Bill, in its present form, but should pass it, if it is to be passed, amended in such a way, as to relieve the country of the necessity for paying this sum of money until it is in a better position to do so, than it is today. The case, already stated, has not been made by the President or anybody else, that there is any obligation, express or implied, legally or morally,   to begin the payment of the sum of money involved under the 1925 Treaty Amendment Act in this year 1926-27. I desire that we should be in a position to say that we can afford to pay this sum of money before binding ourselves to pay it.  Now there are some people who have suggested that it would be the business of the House at any time to say we cannot afford to pay it, and I know that many people engaged in controversy at the recent times would always be in a position, with a clear conscience, to argue that the country cannot afford to pay it.  That would be their perpetual cry, no matter how great the ability to pay, or how low the taxation; I can well imagine that.  It has been the normal experience in every country.  But I am not prepared to say that the responsible Government of the time, in the future, and the party behind the responsible Government in the future, is going to perpetually say it cannot afford to pay a debt which has been entered upon. 
     But we have been told upon the highest authority that we are bearing at present, and will have to bear for a long time, an undue burden, and that we are not honestly able to pay a single penny.  While I do not accept that as a true presentation of the case, I believe that there are urgent demands upon any £400,000 that we could raise this year that ought to be met before this particular £400,000 is paid away, and that we ought not, in this Bill we are now discussing, bind ourselves to pay money until the Dail is in the position to say, by formal resolution, that this year we can afford to pay it. Therefore I ask the Committee to support me in the amendment I am moving. 
     
      
       Deputy Johnson. raises the question whether the country can afford to pay this amount or otherwise. I think the amount will bear rather heavily on the present resources of the country, but that is beside the mark.  We must bear in mind that the original obligation undertaken by this State, in connection with the Treaty. was far in excess of the amount covered by this Bill.  The President in another place already stressed the poverty in the country and by that   argument got the original amount reduced. 
     
     
      
       What was the amount? 
     
     
      
       The original Treaty provided for considerably more than this amount. 
     
     
      
       Not at all. 
     
     
      
       No sum was mentioned. 
     
     
      
       The President stressed that the bargain he made, in connection with this matter, was a very good one for the country.  The Dail accepted that, and undertook the obligation. Now Deputy Johnson's plea is that there should be postponement of the annual payment to be made, to some future date.  But that, to be a valid argument, would seem to visualise that the country, in two or three years, is going to be in a substantially better position to pay the amount than now.  Postponement does not, in any way, take away from the amount that has ultimately to be paid under the agreement.  The policy of this country would be very badly interpreted if we were to put that proposal into operation. I think the sooner the country, once it has a liability to face, faces it and carries out its obligations, the better. 
       Deputy Johnson disclaims any idea of repudiating the liability.  I think it would be very unfortunate if, at this stage or any other, this House should attempt to repudiate liability; but when Deputy Johnson says the country is badly able to bear it, he may, of course, say that I said the same thing&mdash; I think the right course to adopt is to concentrate on saving our expenditure, as far as possible, and on the reduction of our commitments in some other way than by postponing our liabilities. 
       When we come to consider the Budget proposals I suppose there will be a good deal of contention on the question of economies, and so forth, but that I think is no argument at the present time by which we should, having undertaken an obligation, postpone the footing of the Bill. 
     
     
     
      
       I want to take the opportunity to state my position with regard to the vote that I will give on this particular section and the vote that I gave for the financial motion.  The reason that I am voting for this section and that I voted for the financial motion is that we were confronted here, when the agreement was put before us in December last, with an accomplished fact.  To all intents and purposes a pistol was held to our heads.  We were told &ldquo;You must submit to this agreement or else have chaos.&rdquo;  The decision of the Boundary Commission was said to be the alternative to chaos.  As a result of that I supported the agreement. 
       I am prepared reluctantly to support the section as I have already supported the financial resolution.  I disagree almost altogether with the arguments used to support the inclusion of these compensation claims in this agreement. I agree with what Deputy Morrissey said that giving this 10 per cent. additional to those who got compensation under the Act, is a confession that the decisions of our judges were not just or reliable.  The President claimed that a great many people had been under-compensated.  My experience is directly to the contrary&mdash;that a great many people were over-compensated. 
     
     
      
       Under the Damage to Property Act? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       I should like the Deputy to give some instances. 
     
     
      
       I could state dozens of cases. 
     
     
      
       Is the Deputy aware that members of his own Party have suffered very much in this respect? 
     
     
      
       I am aware of that. 
     
     
      
       That ought to be mentioned then. 
     
     
      
       I believe there has been discrimination.  I say there has been discrimination by the judges, that people of a certain class got compensation, while people of another class did not get it.  That is my view   of it.  I think this 10 per cent. is being given because of the clamour of that particular class who were over-compensated and not because of the clamour of Deputies on these benches. We all know that compensation was granted as a sop to the so-called loyalists who went over to England, and said they were under-compensated, and all kinds of other ridiculous things, which were not true.  I also want to say that I did not misunderstand the statement of the Minister for Finance when he said that the payments would not start until 1929.  I fail to understand how any Deputy could have understood to the contrary.  For that reason I cannot support the amendments put down by Deputy Johnson. However, I do not support the sections because I think they are reasonable or just, but because we have no alternative. Having supported the Confirmation of Agreement Act, I see no alternative but reluctantly to give my support to this and the other sections. 
     
     
      
       Like Deputy Heffernan, I am not enamoured of the section which Deputy Johnson proposes to amend.  In my opinion, it is accepting one of the worst features of the Bill. While the Bill is definite in point of time as to repayments, this amendment is indefinite in my opinion and that makes it more unacceptable.  Deputy Johnson accepts the payment of the interest on the sums advanced.  He accepts the whole Government contention that we are liable according to this method of repayment for the annuities for 60 years.  He accepts the whole Government case that we are liable for over £5,000,000.  It works itself down then to whether, if we accept those things&mdash;and I do not wish to be taken for a moment as agreeing to the suggestion that we should&mdash;we should post ourselves as defaulters, for that is what it would amount to, with this thing hanging over us indefinitely, because I presume as good a case can be put up next year to show that we are not able to bear the charge and, perhaps the same thing five years hence. While I would cut down our payments to the minimum, while I would scrutinise every penny as closely as possible.  I would not like to be a party to anything that might be looked on as   defaulting.  It would be bad business for the country.  Therefore, I do not propose to vote for the amendment.  In my opinion, there is very little to distinguish between it and the section, and as such, I believe the Dail should reject it. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Hogan is not prepared to support the amendment because it accepts as something definitely decided by the Dail a liability to pay the total sum.  I am prepared to support a motion to delete the section, because I am opposed to the thing in toto, but I am trying to arrive at a modification of the evil.  I think that the Bill is inopportune, because it is asking us to do something in the way of paying moneys which we are told on every hand we cannot afford to pay.  I am going to take it as an indication of the real mind of the Dail and of every Deputy who votes, if they say that we can afford to pay this this year, that they are not sincere and honest when they talk about reducing this, that and the other during the discussion of the estimates in the next few weeks. 
       Deputy Hewat repeated what many people have come to accept as a truth, but which is by no means the truth: that we undertook an obligation to pay a sum larger than this in the Treaty. The President will agree with me that we did not undertake any obligation of the kind.  We undertook an obligation to pay X if that was a sum greater than our counter-claim which had to be decided by a tribunal.  What the Dail agreed to in December was to pay a sum of money rather than have an indefinite amount hanging over our heads. 
     
     
      
       Will Deputy Johnson give us an idea of what the amount of X would be? 
     
     
      
       It was never presented&mdash;the President told us the Bill had never been presented. 
     
     
      
       I think I did not. I am almost certain that I told Deputies that it had been presented for something like £155,000,000. 
     
     
      
       The President told us that a provisional amount had been   suggested on the other side, but that he had never put forward the counter claim&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       That is right. 
     
     
      
       &mdash;&mdash;believing no doubt that it was going to overwhelm the £155,000,000 and that there would be a big debt due to us instead of due from us.  But rather than have that doubt in the minds of the people, the Dail agreed to buy off that doubt by the payment of this sum of money. The whole question involved is: when shall the payment begin?  Shall it begin in the year 1926/27?  I suggest following the guidance of the expert financiers that we cannot afford to pay £400,000 this year, and I submit that the evidence before us shows that we may be in a very much better position to pay in the near future.  Much will be cleared up to-morrow, I have no doubt, but in the absence of fore-knowledge I am going to refer Deputies to the Estimates for last year in which there occurred a sum of £3,690,000 for property losses compensation.  When that is cleared off, we may be in a reasonably good position to begin to pay this £400,000.  Let us clear off those property losses compensation claims. Let us clear off one part of our war debt before we begin to pay off the other part.  That ought to appeal to the economists.  It ought to appeal to the businessmen; it ought to appeal to the farmers. 
     
     
      
       Is it fair to the creditors? 
     
     
      
       The Deputy will be the first man to cry out if an attempt is made to raise all the money in one year and pay all these debts in one year. 
     
     
      
       I would not accept that at all.  The alternative, as the President put it before us, was that we were to pay four millions in liquidation. I do not know if that would not be a more acceptable plan, if it were feasible. 
     
     
      
       All I say is that we estimated and attempted to raise the money to meet £3,690,000 for the year 1925-6.  We did not pay within two   millions of that sum, and, I am presuming, that that is going to be put into the accounts due for the year 1926-27. 
     
     
      
       Not necessarily. 
     
     
      
       I am assuming that, as the estimate has been placed in our hands.  I am justified in assuming that we are to pay off that bill in 1926-27. 
     
     
      
       The estimate does not disclose how much the Minister is going to raise by loan. 
     
     
      
       I understand that. We are asked to pay this in 1926-27. When that sum is paid off, surely, it is a reasonable proposition to come forward with the later and less clamant claims.  That is all I am asking in the amendment, and, as I said.  I think it is really a test of whether there is any sincerity in the cry that is going on for a reduction in expenditure in 1926-27. 
     
     
      
       I think it is hardly fair to attempt to place those who are demanding a reduction in expenditure in that position, because it is perfectly evident that having agreed to a definite contract we should stand by our word.  That is the first claim, and it must come before any reductions. I am not going to stand up and ask that we repudiate contracts in order to bring about a reduction in expenditure. I say that we should stick to a contract.  Having made a contract it is up to us to carry it out.  I believe that the country can very ill afford to pay this money.  I believe with Deputy Johnson that there are many other claims more urgent, both from the humanitarian point of view and from the point of view of the taxpayer. But a contract is a contract, and nothing has happened since that contract was made to justify us in repudiating it.  As one of the people that Deputy Johnson, I am sure, referred to, and one of the advocates of economy, I believe that I am acting perfectly consistent in voting for this section of the Bill, while, at the same time, standing for economy and demanding cuts in the estimates in every possible quarter. 
     
     
      
       If we are to follow, or to place any reliance on the   statements of British Ministers, there is no payment directly out of our Treasury this year to Great Britain.  The statement made by Mr. Baldwin was that they were retaining this £900,000, which he stated constituted the first instalment. The sum is to be £400,000 this year; £250,000 next year, and £250,000 in subsequent years.  It is true that we will have to increase the Damage to Property Vote by £900,000, but as the British are retaining this sum, if we refuse to complete the work of the Commission, what is going to happen?  Is it not a sign that we are repudiating liability?  I think Deputy Johnson's case fails about paying money this year which we have not got, and which we are not in a position to pay.  You have to meet it.  You have to meet the Damage to Property Vote. As far as I understand, you will have to increase that, unless the Government&mdash;that is a thing we have to discover when the Estimates are under discussion&mdash;have included sums which would come from the British in respect to their liability under the Wood-Renton Commission.  I submit that Deputy Johnson's case fails.  We want to get rid of the work of this Commission. Is it not better that it should be finished within the next year or so, rather than be defaulting, the State, more or less, committing itself to bankruptcy, because of a repudiation of its liability to complete the work of the Commission?  I think Deputy Johnson's amendment falls short of the object, which is to save the Exchequer in these troubled times. 
     
     
      
       There is no question in my mind of repudiating a contract. I deny that the Dail entered into any contract.  There is, therefore, no question of repudiating it. 
       Amendment put, and declared lost. 
       Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       In view of what has occurred I suppose there is very little use debating this matter in any great detail, but it is essential that Deputies should have a further chance of determining what they are about to commit the country to.  I contend that under the London Agreement the strict reading was that we were to repay to   the British Government the sums which they had advanced to us, and which had come into our Exchequer.  I find on examination of the Government proposals, as outlined in Section 6, that that has not been adhered to, and that the situation has been altered to our manifest disadvantage.  I would like to get some answer from the Government, but so far they have consistently ignored it, as to why we were first liable for interest, and why we are accepting capital liability on their own figures of 51⁄4 millions, when we have only received, according to Mr. Baldwin's statement, four millions.  What is the difference?  It is just over 11⁄4 millions.  Mr. Baldwin's exact words were: &ldquo;Our liability will be in excess of five millions, but we are retaining a sum of £900,000.&rdquo; Even if it were 51⁄4 millions, which the Government is assuming, does not that mean that the British Government had handed over a sum of £4,300,000?  It is difficult to understand what the finance of our Executive Council is.  There is one thing must be apparent even to the most dense, that they had a bad case, and that they know they bungled their job.  They have accepted liability for sums which never came to them, and which the country must bear because they were not able to do a sum in subtraction. 
     
     The country must repay this sum of £900,000.  In the course of 60 years it must redeem it, and pay an interest of 41⁄2 per cent. for all that period.  The sum of £2,700,000 will fall upon the people of the Saorstat.  Similarly we will send across to London 57 payments out of our Exchequer of £250,000 annually, or, in other words, a sum of £14,250,000.  Our debt at the moment cannot exceed more than £4,250,000, so we are losing £10,000,000.  What is the justification for our paying that money?  If we did owe £5,000,000, which I deny, there is a sum retained by the British to our detriment, which is not the fault of the British but of the Government here when they offered them an annuity of £250,000 for 60 years.  If we are to meet this payment if that sum of £900,000 which the British hold was justly due by us, and if it is withheld as interest and sinking fund, then a year should elapse from   the date of the London Pact before any interest is due.  The normal proceeding would be to meet this at the beginning of the financial year 1927, nearly a year hence.  There is no interest due in the interval.  It is not business-like to ask us to meet the charge this year, and it shows a lamentable want of financial policy, or financial astuteness, on the part of our Government.  There are three sums which the British hold, one of £400,000 and two of £250,000 each. One in one eventuality would not fall due until two years hence, and in another case would not fall due until three years hence.  That is something at the moment, and they are getting a discount which they would not be entitled to until three years had elapsed. If you were to discount £250,000 due three years hence, how many thousands would it amount to? 
     
      
       At what per cent.? 
     
     
      
       I presume the per cent. we pay. 
     
     
      
       Mention it. 
     
     
      
       It is 41⁄2 per cent.  The British Government, I believe, are paying about 5 per cent. at the moment, and I presume they would not offer you terms less favourable. 
     
     
      
       How does that fit in with your other statement? 
     
     
      
       It fits in perfectly. 
     
     
      
       I mean as regards the £15,000,000? 
     
     
      
       We have two alternatives.  We are either responsible for £5,000,000, of which we are told the British Government have retained at the moment £900,000, as interest.  There is something accruing to us on that sum of £900,000, the last of which is not due until four years hence. 
     
     
      
       You are getting out of the percentage on £15,000,000. 
     
     
      
       I did not   suggest a percentage was coming to us on £15,000,000, but I said we are paying over £10,000,000 interest.  When the President is replying&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I do not intend replying. 
     
     
      
       I am putting it to the House that because the President knows he has no case he is not replying, and that he knows he is in the wrong.  We are not endeavouring to break faith, or to repudiate the London Agreement.  We will give what is justly due, but not more.  This country is too poor and cannot afford to pay beyond its just liability.  I contend that the Government has over-estimated our liability and must bear the responsibility. 
     
     
     
      
       Am I right in saying that the proposal is to delete Section 6? 
     
     
      
       It is that Section 6 stands part of the Bill. 
     
     
      
       But the Deputy's proposal is to delete the section. 
     
     
      
       I am taking it the other way. 
     
     
      
       No matter what way you take it, that is really the purpose and point of this, and I cannot accept the proposal to delete the section.

       To add at the end of the section the following words: &ldquo;the word &lsquo;court&rsquo; means a court of justice established by the Courts of Justice Acts 1924 and 1926 and does not include a court which though presided over by a judge or justice of one of these courts of justice was not established by those Acts.&rdquo; 
     
     
        The effect of the amendment is to make it clear that the Court of the Land Commission and any other such special court which is outside the regular courts set up under the Courts of Justice Act, are not affected by this Bill. 
     Amendment put and agreed to. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     SECTION 3. 
     (1)  There shall be attached to the High Court, the Supreme Court, and the Chief Justice respectively the following offices, that is to say:&mdash; 
     To the High Court, 
     The Central Office, 
     The Master's Office, 
     The Taxing-Master's Office, 
     The Probate Office, 
     The Bankruptey Office, 
     The Accounts and Inquiries Office, 
     The Accountant's Office; 
     To the Supreme Court, 
     The Office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court; 
     To the Chief Justice, 
     The Office of the Registrar to the Chief Justice. 
     (2)  There shall be attached to the High Court, the Supreme Court, and the Chief Justice respectively the following officers (in this Part of this Act collectively referred to as principal officers), that is to say:&mdash; 
     To the High Court, 
     A Master who shall be styled the Master of the High Court. 
     Such number of Taxing-Masters as the Minister shall, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, from time to time determine, 
     An Officer for Accounts and Inquiries, 
     A Probate Officer, 
     A Registrar in Bankruptcy, 
     An Assignee in Bankruptcy, 
     An Accountant; 
     To the Supreme Court, 
     A Registrar; 
     To the Chief Justice, 
     A Registrar. 
     (3)  The Master of the High Court   and the Taxing-Masters shall be appointed by the Executive Council and every other of the said principal officers shall be appointed by the Minister, and all the said principal officers (including the Master of the High Court and the Taxing-Masters) shall hold office at the pleasure of the Executive Council. 
     (4)  Subject to the persons respectively appointed thereto being in good health at the time of appointment, the offices of the Master of the High Court and of the Taxing-Masters shall be pensionable offices within the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1923, and the pension, allowance, or gratuity granted to or in respect of a Master of the High Court or a Taxing-Master on his retirement or death shall be ascertained in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed by those Acts. 
     (5)  The Master of the High Court and every Taxing-Master shall retire from office on attaining the age of seventy years. 
     
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (1), page 3, line 30, to delete the words &ldquo;The Master's Office.&rdquo; 
       The reason this amendment is introduced is that there is no necessity for a separate Central Office for the Master by reason of the fact that he will be head of the Central Office for which provision is made in the Bill. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (1), page 3, line 34, to delete the words &ldquo;Accounts and Inquiries&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;Examiner's.&rdquo; 
       That is really a matter of drafting. It is felt that the title &ldquo;Examiner's&rdquo; is less cumbersome and less likely to be confused with the title of the Accountant and Auditor-General.  I think the title proposed in the amendment is a more suitable title for the holder of the Office. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       In regard to amendment (4) which stands in my name, I think it would be better, if I may be   allowed, to postpone any discussion on it, because it is all involved in the amendment to Section 17.  If that were carried, with good fortune and the grace of the Minister, we could move this amendment on the Report Stage.  I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. 
       Amendment No. 4 not moved. 
     
     
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (2), page 4, line 4, to delete the words &ldquo;Officer for Accounts and Inquiries&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;Examiner.&rdquo; 
       This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 3. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (2) page 4, line 7, after the word &ldquo;An&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;Official.&rdquo; 
       This is to distinguish between the official assignee, who is a permanent official of the Courts, and the creditors' assignee, who is a nominee of the creditors. There are two assignees in the Bankruptey Court&mdash;the official assignee and the creditors' assignee, and the object of this amendment is to distinguish between them. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (3) line 17, page 4. to delete the words &ldquo;shall hold office at the pleasure of the Executive Council&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;shall only be removable by the Executive Council on the recommendation of the Chief Justice.&rdquo; 
     
     This amendment was put down immediately after the Bill was introduced. I do not know how far the official amendments that have been put down since would cover the point.  The object that was sought to be achieved by the amendment was that the Master of the High Court, the taxing masters, and the principal officers would only be removed from office on the recommendation of the Chief Justice.  The section originally provided that the Master of the High Court and the taxing masters should be appointed by the Executive Council.  It goes further than that, and leaves their position in the hands of the Minister, &ldquo;and he   shall only hold office at the pleasure of the Executive Council.&rdquo; Now, it seems to me, and it will possibly be accepted by the Minister for Justice, in view of the negotiations that proceeded as between the Judicature and the Ministry, that the Judicature should have some say in the matter rather than that the appointment should be terminable by the direction, or at the pleasure, of the Executive Council.  The original clause as it stands does not necessarily operate in that way. 
     There is no objection to the appointment, because somebody must make the appointment, and the original appointment of the Executive Council is probably the best way that it could be made; but my point is that the appointment having been made by the Executive Council, the office should be permanently filled, subject to the good conduct of the man occupying the position, just in the same way as if he were one of the judges.  I do not know whether it would be necessary to visualise what might happen under the clause as it originally stood.  I would like to hear from the Minister or from the Parliamentary Secretary what his view is in connection with the adoption of this amendment. 
     
      
       The Deputy will notice amendment No. 8, which reads: 
       &ldquo;(4) No principal officer nor any officer for the time being nominated to be a registrar of the High Court shall be removed from his office without the concurrence of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court.&rdquo; 
     
     That amendment represents the agreement arrived at with the judges, and it is as far as I am prepared to go in the matter.  The point of contrast with the Deputy's amendment is that the Deputy's amendment leaves the initiative with the Chief Justice.  No removal of an officer shall take place without the concurrence of the Chief Justice.  The official amendment which follows the Deputy's specifies that no principal officer shall be removed without the concurrence of the Chief Justice and President of the High Court. Personally I do not regard the official amendment (No. 8) as any real   strengthening of the tenure of the principal officer.  The principal officers would have Civil Service tenure.  It is a tenure which reads on paper as a life tenure, at the pleasure of the Executive Council.  Of course it is a very strong tenure, and it is not any strengthening of it to say that no officer shall be removed without the concurrence of these two judges, because I do not consider that there would be a proposal to remove any officer for a matter less weighty than that which would receive, of course, the concurrence of these two judges.  I do not think that any civil servant has ever been removed for a matter which would fail to meet with the fullest approval of two such persons.  So that while it is strengthening on paper the tenure of the principal officers to insert this amendment, I do not think that it is, in fact or in practice, a real strengthening. However, it represents an agreement.  I would not accept the Deputy's amendment.  My own amendment, which follows, is just about as far as the Executive is prepared to go in the matter. 
     
      
       Will the Minister say if his amendment meets with agreement? Is it an agreed amendment that has been put forward after discussion with the Judicature?  I do not agree with the Minister that officials named here become civil servants under this clause.  They are distinctly removable by the section itself.  If you place them on the basis of a civil servant the difficulty is removed to some extent.  But they are not placed in that because they are removable by a political and changeable body&mdash;a body that has not got any permanency itself.  The Executive Council to-day may have quite a different view of political responsibility from the Executive Councils that may follow later on.  There is nothing in this Bill itself that makes the principal officers like the Master of the High Court and the Taxing Master civil servants. 
     
     
      
       Surely the Deputy is aware that the tenure of a civil servant is at the pleasure of the Executive Council?  An established civil servant, the best and the longest established   civil servant, holds office at the pleasure of the Executive Council. That is probably a shock to the Deputy, but it is fact.  Under this Bill the principal officer, quite apart from either the Deputy's amendment or the official amendment, would have the same tenure as any civil servant.  In fact, the effect of my amendment is to give them, on paper, a somewhat stronger tenure. 
     
     
      
       I will have to disagree with the Minister in this particular case when he says that the principal officer could be termed a civil servant.  In the Civil Service, ordinarily, a person enters by examination and proceeds up the ladder by promotion.  This is a case in which the office is filled not by a person who has been spending his life in the Civil Service.  It is filled by a man who has been imported into the position after a long experience in connection with other work. 
     
     
      
       I do not accept the Deputy's amendment. 
     
     
      
       In view of what the Minister has said, and because I think that probably his own amendment goes as far as the Executive Council would go, and because it probably goes far enough, I beg leave of the Dail to withdraw my amendment. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
     
     
      
       took the Chair. 
     
     
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;In page 4, before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(4) No principal officer nor any other officer for the time being nominated to be a registrar of the High Court shall be removed from his office without the concurrence of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court.&rdquo; 
       The object of that amendment is to allay any fear that might exist that the Executive Council might remove a principal officer because of the fact that he made himself obnoxious. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
     
     
     
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (4), page 4, lines 22 to 26, to delete all from the figures &ldquo;1834&rdquo; in line 22 to the end of the sub-section and substitute the following words&mdash;&ldquo;for the time being in force and there may be granted either to those officers themselves on retirement or to their legal personal representatives on death such superannuation and other allowances or gratuities as might under the Superannuation Acts for the time being in force have been granted had they been appointed to the permanent Civil Service of Saorstat Eireann with certificates from the Civil Service Commissioners. 
       This is merely a drafting amendment. There is no difference in the meaning. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (5), page 4, line 28, after the word &ldquo;years&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;but such age of retirement may, in the case of any Taxing-Master who was immediately before the commencement of this Part of this Act a Taxing-Master attached to the High Court, be extended by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance to any age not exceeding seventy-five years.&rdquo; 
       The position at the moment is that the present Taxing Masters are approaching seventy years of age, and it is felt that they can continue to carry the duties of their office for some years to come and that it would not be in the interests of economy that they should retire on pension and have other men appointed to carry on the work which they are well able to do. 
     
     
      
       Is not this amendment sacrificing the principle that has been adopted under other Acts of having an age limit?  If this amendment is adopted, how can you stand by the various age retirements for judges and others who do not run up to the age of seventy-five? 
     
     
      
       Of course you have three Taxing Masters, and these men   took office, as Deputy Duggan explained, rather late in life, on the basis that they were accepting a life office.  It so happens that the oldest of the Taxing Masters, Master MacNamara, is a man of very robust health, and his keenness is, I think, unimpaired. He is efficient and popular, and, in my opinion, capable of discharging the duties of his office for some years to come.  The amendment does, perhaps, advert in a special manner to considerations like that, to considerations that both in the case of Master MacNamara and Master Denning you have men who though advanced in years, are fully capable and willing to continue to discharge the duties of their office for some years further. 
       I do not think it is a sacrificing of the general principle of an age limit. We are saying in the case of the county registrars that while there shall be a statutory retiring age of sixty-five we are asking for permissive elasticity for a further three years so that if a man were thought capable of discharging the duties of his office he might be retained in the public service up to sixty-eight years.  In this case you are dealing with a very much smaller class. You are considering only three men, and there is perhaps&mdash;not improperly, I think&mdash;rather special advertence to the fact that those men are, for their years, exceptionally robust and exceptionally efficient.  The other is a bigger class, and when you are laying down basic provisions you have to deal with the average rather than with the exception. I recognise some men do retain, up to and after their 70th year, quite a remarkable keenness and efficiency; but that is not the average, and when we are dealing with the bigger class of the county registrars we ought to, in the public interest, fix a maximum age of 68 years.  As regards the three years between 65 and 68, we ought to leave it a matter of permissive and discretionary elasticity to say the retiring age shall be 65 years, but where we think fit that may be extended by a further three years. 
     
     
      
       The Minister's explanation is that it is a matter of expediency in this particular case that the   age limit should be increased far in excess of anything adopted as a rule in connection with the courts.  That may be sound in this case, but I am afraid it reacts on other arguments. We have been setting out ages in connection with other Bills, and there is a big difference between them and the ages now mentioned.  That is the objection in this particular case.  No doubt the men referred to are capable of doing their work, but the objection is that this particular principle would apply to a small section of higher officials, and we are not prepared to adopt it in regard to the bigger section of the people; in other words, we are discriminating between different classes and we are making a distinction that is, in my opinion, objectionable. 
     
     
      
       We have a precedent in the case of one of the judges.  The late Recorder of Dublin had a special exemption from the age limit.  I think his age was brought to 73 or 74 years. 
     
     
      
       The age limit here is 75 years. 
       Amendment 10 agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill,&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Question &mdash;&ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill,&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 5. 
       The Master of the High Court shall, subject to the general direction of the Minister, have the general superintendence and control of all offices established by this Part of this Act and shall also have and exercise such powers and authorities and perform and fulfil such duties and functions as shall be from time to time conferred on or assigned to him by statute or rule of court, and in particular (unless and until otherwise provided by statute or rule of court) shall have and perform all such other powers, authorities, duties, and functions as are or become vested in him by virtue of any other provision of this Act. 
     
     
      
       I beg to move: 
     
     To delete lines 45, 46 and 47   and substitute the following sub-section and words:&mdash; 
     &ldquo;(1)  The Master of the High Court shall have the general superintendence and control of such of the offices established by this Part of the Act as are attached to the High Court but shall in the exercise of such superintendence and control be subject to the general direction of the Minister in regard to all matters of general administration and to the directions of the President of the High Court in regard to all matters relating to the conduct of that part of the business of the High Court which is for the time being required by law to be transacted by or before one or more of the Judges of that Court. 
     (2)  In addition to the general superintendence and control aforesaid the Master of the High Court.&rdquo; 
     The effect of that amendment is to limit the executive control of the Master of the High Court and the Minister, and it definitely excludes from executive control that part of the work immediately connected with the judge.  As a matter of fact, it is one of the amendments which has been introduced to meet the objections that the Judiciary had. 
     Amendment agreed to. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill,&rdquo;&mdash; put and agreed to. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 6, stand part of the Bill,&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     SECTION 7. 
     The several Taxing-Masters shall have and exercise such powers and authorities and perform and fulfil such duties and functions as shall from time to time be conferred on or assigned to them by statute or rule of court and in particular (unless and until otherwise provided by statute or rule of court) shall have and exercise all such powers and authorities and perform and fulfil all such duties and functions in relation to the High Court, the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal,   and the Chief Justice as were formerly possessed and performed by the Taxing-Masters of the Supreme Court of Judicature in Ireland in relation to that Court. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       In page 5 to add at the end of the section the following words: &ldquo;and shall also have, exercise, perform and fulfil such other powers, authorities, duties and functions as were immediately before the passing of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924) vested or imposed by law in or on the Taxing Masters of the Supreme Court of Judicature then existing.&rdquo; 
       The meaning of that is very simple. The Taxing Masters had power, apart from cases in which there was an order of the Court directing them to tax costs, to tax ordinary costs between a solicitor and client on the recommendation of the client.  The effect of this amendment is to vest in the Taxing-Master the power to discharge that function in future. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 7, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 8 and 9 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 10. 
       (1)  The Bankruptcy Office shall consist of two branches whereof one branch shall be styled the Registrar's Branch and the other shall be styled the Assignee's Branch. 
       (2)  The Registrar's Branch of the Bankruptcy Office shall be under the management of the Registrar in Bankruptcy and there shall be transacted therein all such business as shall from time to time be assigned thereto by statute or rule of court and in particular (unless and until otherwise provided by statute or rule of court) all such business as was formerly transacted in the Bankruptcy Office of the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland. 
     
     
        (3)  The Assignee's Branch of the Bankruptcy Office shall be under the management of the Assignee in Bankruptcy and there shall be transacted therein all such business as shall from time to time be assigned thereto by statute or rule of court and in particular (unless and until otherwise provided by statute or rule of court) all such business as was formerly transacted in the Office of the Official Assignee of the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       In page .5, to insert the word &ldquo;Official&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;Assignee's&rdquo; in lines 32 and 41 respectively and before the word &ldquo;Assignee&rdquo; in line 42. 
       The amendment is purely consequential. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 10, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 11 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 12. 
       The Assignee in Bankruptcy shall have and exercise all such powers and authorities and perform and fulfil such duties and functions as shall from time to time be conferred on or assigned to him by statute or rule of court and in particular (unless and until otherwise provided by statute or rule of court) shall have and exercise all such powers and authorities as immediately before the passing of this Act were vested by law in the Official Assignee in Bank-ruptey of the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland and shall perform and fulfil such duties and functions as immediately before the passing of this Act were required by law to be or were in fact performed or fulfilled by the said Official Assignee. 
     
     
      
       I move the following amendment, which is consequential:&mdash; 
       In page 5, line 63. to insert the word &ldquo;Official&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;Assignee.&rdquo; 
     
     
        Amendment agreed to. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 12, as amended, stand part of the Bill,&rdquo;&mdash; put and agreed to. 
     SECTION 13. 
     The Office of Accounts and Inquiries shall be under the management of the Officer for Accounts and Inquiries and there shall be transacted in that office all such business as shall from time to time be assigned thereto by statute or rule of court and in particular (unless and until otherwise provided by statute or rule of court) all such business as was formerly transacted in the offices attached to the respective Chambers of the Master of the Rolls and the ordinary judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland and also such business as was formerly transacted in the offices attached to the Land Judge of the said Chancery Division including the offices attached to that Judge in his capacity of Receiver Judge. 
     
      
       I move: 
       In line 12, to delete the words &ldquo;Office of Accounts and Inquiries&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Examiner's Office,&rdquo; and in line 13, to delete the words &ldquo;Officer for Accounts and Inquiries&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;Examiner.&rdquo; 
       That amendment also is purely consequential. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 13, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 14. 
     
     The Officer for Accounts and Inquiries shall have and exercise all such powers and authorities and perform and fulfil such duties and functions as shall from time to time be conferred on or assigned to him by statute or rule of court and in particular (unless and until otherwise provided by statute or rule of court) shall perform and fulfil such duties and functions as were formerly   performed and fulfilled by the several Chief Clerks and Assistant Chief Clerks of the Master of the Rolls and the ordinary judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland respectively and by the Registrar to the Land Judge of the said Chancery Division and by the Chief Receiver. 
     
      
       I move this amendment which is consequential: 
       In line 24, to delete the words &ldquo;Officer for Accounts and Inquiries&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;Examiner.&rdquo; 
       Amendment agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move the following amendment: 
       In line 34, after the word &ldquo;Receiver&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;or the Receiver-Examiner.&rdquo; 
       The official in the Land Judge's Court was called at one time the Chief Receiver and at another time the Receiver-Examiner. That explains why this amendment is introduced. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 14, as amended, stand part of the Bill,&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Sections 15 and 16 put and agreed to. 
       PROPOSED NEW SECTION 17. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Before Section 17 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(1)  The Office for Legal Assistance shall be under the management of the Officer for Legal Assistance. 
     
     (2)  The Officer for Legal Assistance shall consider every application made to him in the prescribed form and if he is satisfied that by reason of the lack of means of the applicant or other sufficient cause that there is a prima facie reason for fear that the ends of justice may be defeated or that the applicant may not be able to secure the legal remedy or redress to which he may be entitled or that the applicant may be put to undue expense in securing such remedy or redress shall give   such assistance to the applicant as he may deem reasonable in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed by regulations provided by the Rules of Court.&rdquo; 
     This amendment embodies an idea that has been suggested more than once by me.  It aims at making it possible for poor people to have the advantage of legal advice and assistance in pursuing their legal claims and protecting them against legal disability. It is not an innovation except in this country, that is to say, it is a proposition that has been, in one way or another, embodied in the statutes of several European countries and of America, and I think it is time, and I think this is a very opportune moment, to raise the question and have embodied this kind of assistance in our legal arrangements.  The idea is to establish as an official of the courts an officer for legal assistance.  The designation does not matter; such an officer has different descriptions in different countries, but in effect the intention is to make citizens, wealthy or poor, equal before the law, to give the poor citizen an opportunity to protect himself against injustice and to secure his rights.  It is said that in respect of such a country as America 20,000,000 people are too poor to employ a lawyer.  If that is anything like the case with regard to America it is probably correct to say that a very much larger proportion of the population in Ireland is too poor to hire lawyers.  So conservative a public man as a former President of the United States, Wm. H. Taft, has spoken emphatically in favour of the extension of this proposition&mdash;the public defender&mdash;from a few States in America to all the States; and in Germany, and I think in Switzerland, Norway and other countries in Europe, such an office and such an officer is at the disposal of people who are too poor to engage lawyers and who would always be without legal assistance if there were no such public officials. 
     Sub-section (2) of the section which I propose says that &ldquo;the Officer for Legal Assistance shall consider every application made to him in the prescribed form, and if he is satisfied that by reason of the lack of means of the   applicant or other sufficient cause that there is a prima facie reason for fear that the ends of justice may be defeated or that the applicant may not be able to secure the legal remedy or redress to which he may be entitled or that the applicant may be put to undue expense in securing such remedy or redress, shall give such assistance to the applicant as he may deem reasonable in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed by regulations provided by the Rules of Court.&rdquo;  I think that it will be generally agreed that there are many cases where people without means are debarred by that fact from getting the advice and assistance in regard to law that they would be entitled to and would obtain had they such means.  With respect, let us say, to claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act, a very big proportion of people who suffer from accidents and are entitled to compensation have a kind of legal assistance; they get assistance by virtue of the fact that they are backed by organisations which have legal assistance at their command.  But there is a very large number of people who have not that support, who ought to be protected and have such advice of a legal kind as is necessary in respect of injury at their work through accident. 
     But apart from such cases as that, it is easily imagined how many cases arise where people, if they were in a position to seek an official and to get legal advice from him, would save themselves very much trouble and very much distress, and I would say that such an official should be available in most of the larger towns, if only as a conciliator between disputants and such an official as that has been appointed in other countries and has rendered very valuable civic service.  If we have a public prosecutor it is not an unreasonable suggestion that there should be available, for people who are not able to afford it, a public defender.  We know that the practice in the courts in respect of serious crime has been for counsel to be assigned to defend the prisoner, but that is not a sufficient safeguard.  It very often happens at the last moment, when opportunities   for the proper making up of a case are not available, and it is more or less accidental that a case is properly defended in such circumstances. 
     What I desire to see&mdash;and I would urge the Minister to consider this whole question&mdash;is that there should be an official ordinarily attached to the courts who could be approached by such a person who is unable to fee counsel, and get the legal assistance required.  As I said, it is not by any means a proposition which is new and untried.  It has been successfully tried and has been extended in other countries. I would like it to be possible to embody in this Bill, with a view to further embodiment in the Rules of Court that are to come before us some day, such a proposal, and I would ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to this amendment. 
     
      
       The problem which the Deputy's amendment adverts to is, of course, as he says, not a new one.  It is one that has received a certain amount of attention in many countries, and so far as we can see no very ideal solution has been found.  There is, in the old Rules of Court under which we are working at present, a certain limited provision to enable proceedings to be taken by or against poor persons. There are rules providing that, on proof of poverty and on the establishing of at least a prima facie case, facilities can be given.  The Deputy, if he wants the reference, will find it under Rules 21 to 30 under Order 16. Rule 21 reads:&mdash; 
       Any person may be admitted in the manner heretofore accustomed to sue or defend as a pauper on proof that he is not worth £25, his wearing apparel and the subject matter of the cause or matter only excepted. 
       Section 22 reads:&mdash; 
       A person desirous of suing as a pauper shall lay a case before counsel for his opinion whether or not he has reasonable grounds for proceeding. 
       Section 23 reads:&mdash; 
     
     No person shall be permitted to sue as a pauper unless the case laid before counsel for his opinion and his opinion thereon with an affidavit of the party or his solicitor that the case   contains a full and true statement of all the material facts 
     And so on 
     shall be produced before the Court or Judge. 
     Those rules were similar, if not identical, to the rules prevailing in England on the same subject.  Then they went a small step further, such a step as, I think, Deputy Johnson would wish us to take under this Bill, but my information as to them is that they have not been completely satisfactory and that they have either been abandoned or are about to be abandoned in favour of a new scheme under which the legal profession itself is to arrange for the supply of legal assistance gratis in proper cases and to set up machinery for deciding what are proper cases.  On the whole, while I am fully alive to the fact that there is a problem there which deserves and will receive consideration, I would not like to take a step simply by way of amendment to this Bill of establishing another office, which would probably be a costly office, to the regular establishments in connection with the Courts.  I would like, too, to get some more definite and certain information as to the methods which have been adopted elsewhere.  At the same time, I would like just to make the point that the need is not as great here as elsewhere.  We have not just the same complex civilisation here that you have, say, in London or any of the larger capitals of the world, and I have not been able to find that there is a very crying need for the establishment of such an office as is contemplated by the Deputy's amendment.  There is seldom a crying need without a fairly articulate demand, and we have received up to the time when the Deputy put down his amendment, scarcely any representations in favour of taking a new and further step along the line of providing facilities for litigation for poor persons.  I would ask the Deputy to be satisfied with the assurance that we recognise the existence of the problem, but it is one towards a solution of which I would like to feel my way more carefully, and I am afraid I could not   simply, by way of amendment to this Bill, take any step in the matter. 
     
      
       I appreciate the sympathetic manner in which the Minister has considered this proposal.  I confess that I did not anticipate that he was going to embody this amendment, as it was drawn, in the Bill as perfect, and to proceed to make arrangements for the appointment of such an officer as is indicated.  I think, however, that on further inquiry he will come to realise that it would be a step towards minimising the actual amount of litigation in the country and the trouble which people get into by virtue of their attempts to go to law.  I have no doubt it is true that the simpler civilisation makes such a proposal somewhat less necessary than, let us say, in London or in America, but there are other countries in Europe which have provisions of a somewhat similar kind, where the civilisation is perhaps as simple as it is here.  What I desire, above all, is to cheapen law and to prevent legal action in the courts. I think that if there was a public legal adviser to whom poor people could have access, it would probably save many contentions in the courts, and in other cases would give assistance which would prevent much injustice and consequently better regard for the law as a whole. 
     
     I would ask the Minister to follow up his promise by a really close inquiry into the operations in other countries of such a public legal defender and legal advisers.  The practice has been fairly general, and while it is true that changes are taking place in England and that instead of officials of the courts doing the work, in future the legal profession themselves are doing it with the authority of the courts and under rules, as I understand it.  The movement is in favour of extending the system of public assistance to poor persons and of simplifying access to such persons, so that what is going to happen in the future is quite in line with what I desire to take place here: that is to say, that people who are without wealth and without means to fee lawyers may have reliable legal   assistance and not be thrown into the jaws of sharks, who are called lawyers sometimes, and that they will be able to rely on competent legal assistance rather than be misled into taking the advice of incompetent legal advisers. I think we ought to make some provision for such public assistance as I have indicated.  With the leave of the House, I desire to withdraw the amendment, but I hope the Minister will pursue the inquiries which I have urged upon him. 
     Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 17 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     SECTION 18. 
     The Registrar of the Supreme Court shall act as registrar to that Court and also as registrar to the Court of Criminal Appeal and shall perform and fulfil in relation to those Courts all such duties and functions as are usually performed and fulfilled by the registrar of a court and shall also have and exercise such powers and authorities and perform and fulfil such duties and functions as shall from time to time be assigned to him by statute or rule of court. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Amendment 19.&mdash;In page 6 to insert at the beginning of the section the following sub-section and words: 
       &ldquo;(1)  The Registrar of the Supreme Court shall have the superintendence and control of the Office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court but shall in the exercise of such superintendence and control be subject to the general direction of the Minister in regard to all matters of general administration and to the directions of the Chief Justice in regard to all matters relating to the conduct of that part of the business of the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal respectively which is for the time being required by law to be transacted by or before one or more of the judges of those courts respectively. 
       (2)  In addition to the superintendence and control aforesaid.&rdquo; 
     
     The effect of that amendment is to leave the executive control with the Minister as to the routine work of the office of the Supreme Court and the   Court of Criminal Appeal, but it makes it clear that control does not extend to the judicial side, and it makes the Registrar responsible to the Minister on the executive side. 
     Amendment put and agreed to. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 18, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 19 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     SECTION 20. 
     The Registrar to the Chief Justice shall have and exercise all such powers and authorities and perform and fulfil such duties and functions in relation to the exercise of the jurisdictions transferred to the Chief Justice by Section 19 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924), as shall from time to time be conferred on or assigned to him by statute or rule of court and in particular (unless and until otherwise provided by statute or rule of court) shall have and exercise all such powers and authorities as were immediately before the passing of this Act vested in the Registrar in Lunacy in Ireland or in the Chief Clerk to the Lord Chancellor for Ireland and shall perform and fulfil all such functions and duties in relation to the exercise of the jurisdictions aforesaid as were formerly performed and fulfilled by the said Registrar in Lunacy and the said Chief Clerk respectively. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       To insert at the beginning of the section the following sub-section and words:&mdash; 
     
     &ldquo;(1)  The Registrar to the Chief Justice shall have the superintendence and control of the Office of the Registrar to the Chief Justice and shall in the exercise of such superintendence and control be subject to the general direction of the Minister in regard to all matters of general administration and to the directions of the Chief Justice in regard to all matters relating to the exercise of the jurisdictions transferred to the Chief Justice by Section   19 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924). 
     &ldquo;(2)  In addition to the superintendence and control aforesaid.&rdquo; 
     That has exactly a similar effect with regard to the Registrar of the Chief Justice as the preceding amendment had with regard to the Registrar of the Supreme Court. 
     Amendment put and agreed to. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 20 as amended stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     SECTION 21. 
     &ldquo;No person shall be appointed under this Act to be Master of the High Court unless at the time of his appointment he is a barrister of not less than ten years' standing who either is then actually practising or has previously practised for not less than ten years.&rdquo; 
     
      
       Perhaps I might save some trouble on this if the Minister would indicate whether amendment 23 covers the point I am seeking in amendment 21. 
     
     
      
       Not quite. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;To add at the end of the section the words &lsquo;Provided always that any member of the staff who is otherwise qualified shall be eligible for appointment and for this purpose a member of the staff of ten years' standing who is also a barrister shall be deemed to be a practising barrister.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
     
     What I desire in amendment 21 is to make it possible that a member of the staff who has been in the service for a period of ten years and is also a barrister shall be deemed, for the purpose of this section, to be a practising barrister.  I do not know how many this section may affect.  It gives a possibility to some people who are in the courts if they are specially qualified to be in the running for the appointment of Master of the High Court.  A practising barrister who has not had practice in the courts would be eligible under this section as it   stands provided he has had actual practice in the courts for ten years, but he might not have knowledge of the working of the courts and the actual operations within the courts, whereas under the section a barrister who has been working within the courts and knows all the Rules of Court and has experience in the courts would be ineligible, that is to say, practice in pleading would be a qualification, but experience in the courts, having become a barrister, would leave the person ineligible.  It seems to me there is a difficulty there which does not make for greater efficiency.  I think there is a good deal to be said, provided educational qualifications and character qualifications are equal, for the argument that the person who has had actual experience in the administrative work of the court is better qualified for the mastership than a man with only equal qualifications but without that experience in the administrative side of the court work.  The object of this amendment is to make it possible for such a person having that administrative experience and being a barrister to be appointed if otherwise eligible and otherwise preferable. 
     
      
       I am anxious to support Deputy Johnson in this amendment. I think the spirit of it is sound and I hope the Minister, if he does not see his way to accept it in Deputy Johnson's words, will accept either that or the alternative definition given in amendment No. 28 for the Deputy-Master of the High Court, which makes it possible for an existing official to become Deputy-Master.  I think it should be also possible for an official with those qualifications to be a Master.  As Deputy Duggan knows, there are barristers and barristers.  There are some who, instead of practising, become professors of philosophy and leaders of parties.  I have known barristers who have become leader-writers on newspapers. Therefore the word &ldquo;practising barrister&rdquo; is wisely put in; but a barrister, an official of the courts, is not in the same position as those who follow the attractions of politics or journalism.  He is in constant touch with the work.  He knows what is   going on every day.  He is in a legal atmosphere and therefore he should, as Deputy Johnson urges, be held eligible for the highest post.  There is another point.  The Minister, on the Second Reading, said he was anxious to avoid anything that would add to the Pensions Vote.  That is his desire.  It is, I think, the desire of the Dail, and it is certainly the desire of the country, that we should not be burdened with more pensions than we can avoid.  If he will leave the highest posts open to the officials of the court, he will give them an inducement to continue in their work.  The word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; has become rather fly-blown; and by doing this you will effect some saving in the charge on the public for pensions. Therefore I hope the Minister will accept the spirit of this amendment and make the position of Master open to the existing officials of the court. 
     
     
      
       The Deputies will agree that we have gone very far and gone much further than any previous Government towards opening up every post, in the courts, to the staff.  The only exception to that general provision is this position of Master and Taxing Master.  There will probably be three in all, because I think it is likely in future that two Taxing Masters will be sufficient.  That was not done in any arbitrary way.  It was done after consideration and reflection. Perhaps the Deputies will agree that there is a strong case for having this chief officer in the court, a man taken from the ring who has lived the life of the Bar, who knows barristers, who has practised with and against barristers, rather than simply a man who has worked his way up through the grades of the Civil Service as it will be in the future.  There is, I suggest, a difference between a B.L. and a barrister, between the man who has a degree, simply as a degree, in the same way as he may have his B.A. or M.A. from the University and a man who knows the minutiæ of the practice of the Bar and has himself practised. 
     
     I think there would be a very definite feeling, certainly of the members of the legal profession, and, I think, of most people familiar with the working   of the courts, that this officer ought to be a man known to, and readily accessible to all the people who are in the ring, all the practising members of the profession, and that he should have a personal knowledge of the requirements and the difficulties of the profession.  It is considerations of that kind which cause me to exclude this one post from the ordinary promotion of the staff, and to take the decision that the man to fill that post must have practised for a prescribed period or must be actually practising.  In the same way we felt that the taxing masters ought to be people taken from the solicitors' profession and men of standing in that profession and known to its members. 
     
      
       Members of the Union. 
     
     
      
       It is not really that point of view, but just that we feel that a man would not be competent to discharge the duties of the office who had not practised in the profession himself. Those were the general considerations, and while I have, in the interval during which the Bill was under considerations, received one or two representations in the contrary direction, I was not convinced that it was not wise and sound and proper to take the chief officer, the Master of the High Courts, from the practising profession, or, at least, to say that he must, at the same time, have practised himself.  We have thrown all the other offices open freely to the staff and made them accessible by promotion. I feel disposed to adhere to that one exception. 
     
     
      
       The Minister has really been answering a case that has not been made.  One would think from the Minister's speech that Deputy Johnson's amendment made it compulsory for him to appoint an official, whereas that is not the case.  The Minister could appoint a practising barrister if the amendment is carried.  It only provides that if there happens to be in the courts an official with exceptional qualifications, and if the Minister thinks that he is better fitted for the post than any practising barrister he can appoint such a man. 
     
     
      
       I know.  Perhaps I   made the case incompletely.  The case which I intended to outline was that it seems to me that the practising members of the profession are entitled to demand that the man who will fill that post will have practical knowledge of the requirements of the profession, such a knowledge that could only be acquired by having lived the life of a practising member of the profession. 
     
     
      
       I think there is a defect in the Minister's argument, even taking his own view of the desirability of having as Master someone who has had experience.  Within the proposals of the Bill as they stand a person may be appointed, if otherwise thought qualified, even though he may have been outside practice for twenty years.  He may have been outside the courts for twenty years, provided that he had practised for ten years.  Then he might retire to the profession of journalism or to the professional chair for another ten or fifteen years, and he would still be eligible to be appointed as Master, whereas the man in daily touch with the profession, with a knowledge of the comings and goings, would be ineligible.  I think there is a defect even from the Minister's own point of view.  If he said that this clause should provide that the man who is to be appointed must be actually practising up-to-date the argument might be water-tight, but, inasmuch as it makes it possible for a man to be appointed as Master who has been out of touch with the courts for twenty years, by making it impossible for the man who is qualified as a barrister but has been in daily touch with the actual administrative side of the courts up to date, he creates an anomaly that ought to be remedied.  As Deputy Cooper has emphasised, there is no suggestion here that you must appoint such a person or that there is going to be any inevitable rise of an incompetent.  It is making it possible for the best qualified person to be appointed if that person happens to be an officer of the courts. 
     
     
      
       I think this is a point which might be argued indefinitely.  I would like to say that I rather agree with the Minister as against the proposition   to leave the office open to promotion within the staff.  It is all very well to say that the amendment merely proposes to insert the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo; I think you have got to make up your minds that the amendment means that either the post is going to be compulsorily filled by qualified men on the staff or that an outsider is going to be put into an invidious position by coming in under certain circumstances. The insertion of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is going to create a position in which the ordinary staff would claim promotion to the office, and if they do not get it there would be a distinct grievance. Where you put in the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; I think you might as well put in the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  Under the new order of things these offices are going to be laid down on a Civil Service basis. While one has the greatest possible admiration for civil servants in connection with their training and ability, may I say that the Civil Service runs largely in a groove and that these offices would be no exception to the ordinary offices in which things go very much in a groove.  This particular post should be thrown open for the appointment of a barrister who has had ten years' practice, rubbing shoulders with other barristers, and getting an intimacy, not only with his brother-barristers and with court procedure, but also with the general public and the views of the public on various matters.  That is an experience which you cannot get in the ordinary routine of office.  I think that the position is one which should be looked forward to by distinguished members of the Bar, as an office that ought to be thrown open to them in the ordinary way just as the position of a judge is thrown open to members of the Bar as an ordinary incentive in connection with their public and private life. 
     
     Of course Deputy Johnson, in putting forward his amendment, advances reasonable arguments.  As far as I am concerned I believe that the State will be better served by the appointment of a person who has the qualifications laid down in the Bill.  Deputy Johnson raised a question that a man who may be ten years at the Bar, may disappear for another period and then   come back still qualified.  I do not know how you would get over that difficulty as regards the appointment, but I would say that the Minister appointing a man who had been away from the Bar for a considerable time, occupying a position not analogous to that of Bar practice, would be stretching his authority very considerably.  I do not imagine it is the intention that any such person should be appointed.  If it is the intention that such a person should be appointed I think that an amendment might be properly framed to prevent any such thing happening. 
     
      
       I totally disagree with Deputy Hewat upon this matter.  This officer's duties will be largely, if not entirely, administrative. He will have the general superintendence and control of all offices established by this part of this Bill.  That is to say, his duties will be administrative very largely.  A man may be an exceedingly good advocate at the Bar, have a very large practice, and plead cases very eloquently, but may be altogether helpless if put into an office. That is what is contemplated.  He has the superintendence of the officers, who will be mainly civil servants, and I maintain that a man who has worked himself up through this office is at least   as likely to be capable of superintending and controlling these offices as a man taken from the Bar who will be largely new to these duties and to this work.  It is as likely that a man of that type if he has other qualifications &mdash;and if he has not the Minister would not appoint him&mdash;who has large experience of official routine of this kind will be capable of doing the work which we set out for him to do in this Bill as the man who has never had any experience of office work or of official duties. 
     
     
      
       I do not think that the Master's duty is quite correctly described by Deputy O'Connell. 
     
     
      
       The Master of the High Courts shall, &ldquo;subject to the general direction of the Minister, have the general superintendence and control of all offices established by this part of the Act.&rdquo;  It is quite clearly an administrative office and experience of administration, I urge, is at least as valuable for the work to be done as experience in advocacy in court. 
     
     
      
       I think that the Master is very largely in touch with the judges and the regulation of the court business.

     IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - CLAIMS FOR ARMY PAY&mdash;ADJOURNMENT DEBATE. 
     
      
       I gave notice of a question on the adjournment dealing with 304 men who have applied since 1st December, 1924, for arrears of pay due them by the Department of Defence for services rendered in the National Army.  The Minister for Defence, in reply to my question to-day, said that no formal official notice was given to officers, N.C.O.'s or men on demobilisation before 1st December, 1924, that arrears of pay should be claimed by them.  If no official information was given to men demobilised prior to 1924 who had claims for arrears of pay, surely those claims when made should be gone into and considered.  There are 704 people who served the State and who are owed from six months' to three months' pay, and those people have not received the wage lawfully earned by them.  If they were ordinary workmen and if their employer refused to pay them three months' or six months' wages, they could prosecute him in court, but these men, once their claim is turned down by the Minister for Defence, have no redress.  I think that is really unfair, and I ask that the Minister for Defence should at least consider the 304 claims lodged since 1st December.  I do not wish him to go into the 1,011 cases in which claims have not been pressed.  There are still under investigation only six cases.  I would like him to add to the six those 304.  Some of these men have been in hospital and did not know that their claims should be in before the 1st December. No official notice was given of it.  It is to see that justice is done to those men who have lawfully earned their pay that I raise this question. The present Minister was not in office at the time I refer to, but he has the files at his disposal and he has the services of his officials and consequently he must be held responsible.  It is only right that men who rendered service to the State and who, in many cases, have pre-Truce records should receive justice from the Minister and I think their claims should receive attention. 
     
     
      
       It is quite evident that some date had to be fixed when these claims would cease to come in.  It is also quite evident to my Department that there were a number of bogus claims coming along.  Everybody knew that these claims should have come along within a certain period.  When one man in an area got back pay, everyone in that area knew that if they had any claim   they were entitled to get their money. A year elapsed during which these claims came along, and on the 1st December, 1924, it was thought that sufficient time had been given.  There were 304 claims received after 1st December, 1924.  We know that a number of people sent in claims during that period, certified by people who got paid for certification, and that a number of those claims were bogus.  We also know that men have claimed for money that we hold receipts for.  It is up to the Department to see that the country is not called on to pay money to persons who make claims for services they did not render.  I want to see that every man who is entitled to payment should be paid, and that is the policy of my Department, but we are not going to pay out money to people who make bogus claims against the State.  We did think of prosecuting some people for making claims of that kind, but finally we considered it was better not to proceed against them.  Although   we have not provided in the Estimates this year for any expenditure under this heading, if Deputy Lyons can bring forward any specific cases that he can stand over and prove.  I will see that they are investigated, and if they are entitled to be paid I shall certainly see that they will get the money.  I do not admit that there are a number of people who are entitled to be paid for services rendered and who have not been paid.  There may be half a dozen cases, perhaps&mdash;these things always occur&mdash;but, generally speaking, I can say that there are not a number of people who are entitled to payment and who have not got it.  As I say, however, if the Deputy brings forward any specific case that can stand on its merits, I will have it investigated and see that the money will be found for payment. 
     
     
      
       I am quite satisfied with the statement of the Minister. 
       The Dail adjourned at 8.35. 
     
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - REFUND OF DUTY. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he has received a claim for 19s. 4d. paid by Mr. J. Noonan, Ballymahon, Co. Longford, in connection with a consignment of ladies' coats from Marmac Ltd., London; whether he is aware that the claim arises out of the fact that £6 8s. 3d. worth of the goods were returned, and whether he is entitled to a refund of the duty paid on the goods returned. 
     
     
      
       The claim referred to has not been received. 
       In regard to the last part of the question, there is no provision for the repayment of duty paid on imported articles of personal clothing and wearing apparel in cases where the articles have been released from official charge and have been subsequently returned to the senders abroad. 
     
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - ROSCOMMON COMPENSATION CLAIM. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence whether a claim for compensation for the loss of his son killed in the fight against the British on April 19th, 1921, made by Patrick McDermott, of Brackloon, Castlerea, Co. Roscommon, has been refused; whether both the claimant and his wife are up to eighty years of age; whether their remaining son is an invalid; whether they have now to employ help to enable them to work their farm of fourteen acres; and whether, in view of all this, the Minister would be prepared to reconsider his decision. 
     
     
      
       Mr. McDermott's claim was dealt with under the Army Pensions Act, 1923.  Investigations showed that the claimant was not dependent on his son prior to the death of the latter.  I regret that the claim had therefore to be disallowed. 
     
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - SOLDIER'S PAY ARREARS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for   Defence if he can state whether a claim has been received by his Department from John Carroll, lately a tailor in the National Army, for arrears of grade money payable to him under Defence Order No. 34, and, if this claim is in order, whether he will expedite payment of same. 
     
     
      
       A claim has been received from Mr. Carroll for arrears of additional pay as a tailor in respect of the period from the 15th March, 1924, to the 5th January, 1925, and has been disallowed on the ground that the applicant was not employed as a tailor during the period in question. 
     
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - BALLYNACARGY (WESTMEATH) APPLICATION. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence if he can say whether any decision has been come to in regard to the claim for compensation of Frank Gallagher, Ballynacargy, Co. Westmeath, and, if so, if he will expedite payment. 
     
     
      
       It is regretted that it has not yet been possible to deal with Mr. Gallagher's claim.  A decision will, however, be taken on it at an early date. 
     
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - SEIZED GUNS (WESTMEATH). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence if he can state whether a D.B.B.L. gun, made by Bentley, London, the property of Mr. Christopher Fox, Glascorn, Ballina, Mullingar, has been traced, and, if not, whether Mr. Fox will receive compensation for same. 
     
     
      
       Mr. Fox's gun cannot be traced in this Department.  He is being requested to furnish full particulars as to the surrender of the gun in order to enable further enquiries to be made. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence if he can state what is the position in connection with a claim made by Patrick Kilmurray, Mullingar, for £30 in respect of a D.B. sporting gun taken from him by the R.I.C. in November, 1920, for which claimant holds a receipt, and which cannot be traced. 
     
     
     
      
       Mr. Kilmurray's claim has been complicated by a discrepancy between the descriptions of the gun as furnished by him when applying for its return and when applying for compensation.  The claim is at present under consideration by the Home Office, London. 
     
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - RATHCAM (WESTMEATH) LANDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if it is the intention of the Land Commission to acquire, for the relief of congestion, the lands of Rathcam, Westmeath, consisting of two hundred and forty acres, which were previously owned by Captain R.S. Lemon, and are at present in the possession of James Little, Carrick, Mullingar. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission have had a preliminary inspection made of the lands of Rathcam with a view to ascertaining if they would be suitable for acquisition under the Land Act, 1923, and the matter is under consideration. 
     
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - LEVINGE ESTATE (WESTMEATH). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state whether any negotiations have taken place by the Land Commission with Mrs. Norah Levinge, Violetstown, Westmeath, in connection with the lands of Belfield; and if he will state when it is likely that these lands, consisting of two hundred acres, will be distributed amongst the uneconomic holders in the district, and if he is further aware that Mrs. Levinge has lands also in Violetstown, Levington, Tornanstown, and Clonunbawn. 
     
     
      
       The lands of Belfield (otherwise Brannockstown) referred to appear to comprise a holding in the occupation of the Representatives of Henry Loftus Lewis, deceased, as judicial tenant on the Estate of G.R. Hyde, County Westmeath.  This holding will be a &ldquo;retained&rdquo; holding and will be dealt with as such when the Land Commission are dealing with the Estate under the Land Act, 1923. 
     
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - CO. KILDARE CONGESTS. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that about fifty-two congests in the townlands of Little-town, Lowtown, and Robertstown, Co. Kildare, who are tenants of Sir P.F. Aylmer, are anxious to have their holdings vested in the Land Commission, so that they may obtain the benefits of the Land Act, 1923, and whether he will instruct the Land Commission to take the necessary steps to acquire these lands. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission are unable to identify the lands referred to on the Aylmer Estate as pending for sale before them under the Land Purchase Acts.
