     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ROSSLEA BURNINGS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether arrangements have yet been completed with the British Government to enable payment of compensation to be made to Mr. J.J. Fox and other residents of Rosslea, Clones, who were the victims of the Rosslea burnings in February, 1921. 
     
     
      
       No agreement has yet been come to with the British Government in regard to the cases mentioned by the Deputy.  The question is at the moment the subject of correspondence with that Government.  The difficulty is to find a basis on which liability for the damage suffered will be divided between the Governments.  In cases of this kind the decrees were levied over areas which are now partly in the Saorstat and partly in Northern Ireland.  Each Government may accept liability for the damage in the proportions in which the decrees were so divided or may accept full liability for all the damage occurring within its own borders.  I will do everything possible to expedite the disposal of the matter. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - PORTLAOGHISE COMPENSATION CLAIM. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he can state the date on which the claim made by Mrs. Jane Salmon, Ballydavis, Portlaoghise, Leix, was received by the Minister and the Compensation (Ireland) Commission for damage done to her property by   British forces; the date on which the inspection was made locally, and the date on which the inspector furnished his report, if any, to the Commission, and if he can now state what compensation it is proposed to pay in this case or state reasons why payment cannot be made. 
     
     
      
       The claim referred to by the Deputy would appear to have been brought to the notice of my Department for the first time in January, 1925.  I am aware that Mrs. Salmon was in correspondence with the Commission in May, 1925, but I have no knowledge of the date on which the claim was first lodged with the Commission or of the action taken by them in the matter.  No award was made by the Commission and no payment can, therefore, be made by my Department. As the Commission have now ceased to function, there is no way by which the case can be re-opened. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the intentions with regard to the proposed drainage improvements on the Lough Gowna, Oughter, and Erne drainage district; when it is proposed to start work, or what money has been allocated to be spent on the district, and on what part of the works are the improvements to be made. 
     
     
      
       As a result of representations made to the Commissioners of Public Works and further investigations made by their engineers, it has been found that the scheme for the restoration and improvement of the Loughs Oughter and Gowna and River Erne drainage district and the Lough Oughter and River Erne drainage district would prove unduly expensive in proportion to the results, and must be revised.  At present inquiries are being made into the question, and until they are concluded it will not be possible to give the information asked for. 
     
     
      
       Is it intended to spend any money this season?  Promises have been made time and again, not to me, but to other parties. 
     
     
     
      
       I do not think I could give any further reply to the Deputy with the information which is available at the moment. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if it is proposed to carry out any improvements on the Kill Drainage district, and, if so, when it is proposed to start work, or what sum of money has been allocated to be spent. 
     
     
      
       It is not proposed to carry out any works of restoration in the Kill drainage district under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, as the cost would impose a charge on the occupiers of benefited land which it is believed would be excessive. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - TAX COLLECTOR'S REMUNERATION. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Mr. B.S. Tiernan, Collector of Taxes, resigned his appointment on the 19th February, 1926, and whether, though he has applied repeatedly, he has not yet received the arrears of remuneration then due to him, and if the Minister will see that any money due to him is paid without further delay. 
     
     
      
       Mr. Tiernan resigned his position as Collector of Taxes when he was about to be dismissed for failure to carry out his duties. 
       An examination of his accounts is now being made, and the question of any further payment of remuneration cannot be considered until the investigation is complete. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - BALLINAMORE AND BALLYCONNELL CANAL DRAINAGE. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what is the policy of his Department with regard to drainage on the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal; if it is proposed to carry out any improvements in that drainage district under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, and, if so, when it is proposed to start work, and what money has been allocated for this purpose. 
     
     
     
      
       There is no change in the situation relative to the restoration of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell drainage district since the 7th April last, when the Deputy was furnished by the Commissioners of Public Works with a copy of a letter that had been issued on that date to the Secretaries of the Leitrim and Roscommon County Council.  In that communication the councils were asked to furnish their views as to the future of the canal, and a reply is still awaited from the first-mentioned council before the matter can be further considered. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister say that no replies have yet come from the county councils? 
     
     
      
       Not from the Leitrim County Council. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - NEWCESTOWN (CORK) PERSONAL INJURIES CLAIM. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he will in the light of the evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant reconsider his previous decision to reject the claim of Patrick Boyle, Newcestown, Co. Cork, for injuries sustained in a mine explosion, in view of the fact that such evidence tends to show that Boyle was not connected with Irregular activities. 
     
     
      
       As I explained to the Deputy, in reply to a previous question, this case was previously considered by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee who were unable, in view of their terms of reference and in the light of the evidence submitted to them, to make a recommendation for the payment of compensation.  The Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, who were a tribunal for assessing compensation in cases such as this, have long since ceased to function and in the circumstances I regret that it is not possible to have the case re-opened. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that in his previous reply he stated that no award was made in this case because of certain tendencies, certain connections, of the claimant   and in view of the fact that evidence was submitted from the Catholic priest and several other persons, does the Minister not consider that that would have some weight in the direction of re-opening the matter? 
     
     
      
       It is very difficult to see what could be done, even if there were further evidence.  The machinery for assessing compensation was the Committee which has been dissolved, and I do not think it could be called together again. 
     
     
      
       Is it within the Minister's discretion to give some little payment?  The man is wretchedly poor. 
     
     
      
       I am afraid not.  No payments have been made except on the report of the Committee. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - MILITARY FUNERALS&mdash;CLAIMS FOR WREATHS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that his Department has refused to sanction payment to traders of amounts claimed in respect of wreaths requisitioned by army officers on the occasions of funerals of officers and men killed during the Irregular campaign, and whether, in view of the loss sustained by traders, he will now consider favourably the payment of such claims. 
     
     
      
       I have made very careful inquiries and I cannot find any   instance where sanction was not readily given by my Department to any submission by the Department of Defence for the payment of general funeral expenses in the class of cases to which the Deputy refers.  I am aware, however, that a decision was arrived at in the Department of Defence to the effect that an item in funeral expenses such as wreaths could not be regarded as properly chargeable to public funds. In one instance, however, the Department of Defence did, owing to very exceptional circumstances, include, in their submission to my Department, a charge for wreaths and the charge was sanctioned.  Perhaps the Deputy would forward particulars of the cases he has in mind to the Minister for Defence if he wishes to pursue the matter further.  My Department will be prepared to consider on its merits any such case submitted by the Department of Defence. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - RATEABLE VALUATIONS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state the total rateable valuations in respect to lands and buildings in each county and urban administrative area in the Saorstat. 
     
     
      
       The information desired by the Deputy has now been complied and takes the form of a rather lengthy schedule, which could not conveniently be read out.  It will, however, be printed in full in the Parliamentary Debates:&mdash;

     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - EXPLOSIVES FOR QUARRY WORK. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that great inconvenience, together with loss of time and money, has been caused to Tipperary South Riding County Council by the arrangement whereby explosives for quarry work have to be procured through the military station at Templemore, and if he will make arrangements whereby such explosives will be stored by the County Surveyor, or in the alternative, made available through the military station at Clonmel. 
     
     
      
       I am aware that explosives for industrial purposes have recently been transferred from Clonmel to Templemore military station.  There is no objection to explosives being stored by the County Surveyor for the Tipperary South Riding provided that magazines or stores are constructed in   accordance with the provisions of the Explosive Acts and Regulations. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that owing to the change which has been made and the difficulty consequent upon that change of obtaining explosives, and the delay that has occurred, many of the men employed normally by the South Tipperary County Council have been unemployed, in some cases for a week, while they were trying to get the explosives?  Will the Minister try to make some arrangement whereby the procuring of explosives will be made more easy for the county council? 
     
     
      
       I will certainly try to make all the arrangements that can possibly be made to obviate inconvenience of that kind; but such arrangements will have to be within the Acts and regulations by which I am bound in the matter of explosives. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister not think that the time has now arrived when the regulations might be relaxed somewhat? Has not the time arrived now when there is not that danger in regard to explosives that there was when the regulations were made? 
     
     
      
       There were special precautions taken arising out of special conditions here, but the laws and regulations of which I speak in connection with this question are the ordinary laws and regulations with regard to high explosives that existed in the past, and quite apart from any special need for precautions here arising out of the military situation we had two or three years back.  I cannot depart from those regulations, but every possible arrangement within those regulations is at present open.  There are no special restrictions imposed by me or by the police. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister not aware that those special restrictions were imposed by an alien government to repress the popular movement which has now subsided? 
     
     
      
       They were not; that is quite wrong.  They are the   same regulations that exist in regard to the custody of high explosives in England and they are for the protection of the public and have no special reference to any kind of political or military situation. 
     
     
      
       Am I to understand that it is as easy for county councils to obtain explosives now as it was in what might be called the old days before the special regulations were issued? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CLONCURRY ESTATE EMPLOYEE'S APPLICATION. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that John Ennis, Cloncurry, Enfield, Co. Kildare, who was employed by Lord Cloncurry on the grazing farm of Ballinakill (Cloncurry Estate), for the last ten years, is unemployed since the 26th January, 1926, the date on which the Land Commission took over possession of the farm, and whether he will ask the Commissioners to consider this man's claim for a parcel of land to enable him to provide for his family as there is no other employment available in the neighbourhood. 
     
     
      
       I have not had time to get particulars in regard to this case.  I would like the Deputy to repeat the question. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - LIMERICK LANDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether the Land Commission intends taking over the property of Colonel Roche Kelly, known as Rockstown and Ballybricken, Co. Limerick, if he is aware that those lands were inspected on various occasions, and so far no steps have been taken to acquire them, and if he will state what are the intentions, if any, as regards those lands. 
     
     
      
       The estate has been inspected and the question of the acquisition of the lands of Ballybricken South and Rockstown is at present   under the consideration of the Land Commission. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state what steps have been taken to acquire the lands of Mitchelstown, Co. Limerick, the property of Mr. Claude Clery, for distribution amongst the uneconomic holders of the locality, if he is aware that those lands were inspected over two years ago, and so far no steps have been taken by the Commissioners to take over same for distribution amongst the uneconomic holders and landless people in the locality. 
     
     
      
       The question of the acquisition of these lands is under consideration. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ACQUISITION OF BRE LANDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether it is the intention of the Land Commission to acquire the lands of Mrs. Barrington, Fassaroe, Bre (Bray), for distribution amongst uneconomic holders and landless men in the district. 
     
     
      
       The lands of Fassaroe, containing some 326 acres were purchased under the Land Purchase Acts, and the Commissioners do not propose to acquire them under the provisions of the Land Act of 1923. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - WILMOTT SMITH ESTATE. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state what stage has been reached in regard to the vesting of the Wilmott Smith Estate, Ballynanty, Co. Limerick, and if he can give any information as to the date of the division of the said estate. 
     
     
      
       The notice given of this question was not sufficient to enable me to get the necessary information. I shall be glad, therefore, if the Deputy will repeat this question next week. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - LANDS FOR SAILORS AND SOLDIERS. 
     
      
       asked the   Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state how much money is at the disposal of the Irish Land Commission for the provision of land under Part I. of the Irish Land (Provision for Sailors and Soldiers) Act, 1919; how much money has been expended on the project since the inception of the Act, and how much land has been allotted to this purpose. 
     
     
      
       I have not had time to get information, and I would ask the Deputy to repeat the question next week. 
     
   
   
     CORONERS (AMENDMENT) BILL, 1926 (SEANAD)&mdash;SECOND STAGE. 
     
      
       I suggest to the Dail that the Second Stage of this Bill be passed without discussion and the Committee Stage can be left over until the Winter Session. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister give us any idea what advantage would be derived by taking the Second Stage now?  I must confess that I have not read the Bill and I do not know whether we would be justified in giving it a Second Reading. Unless we have some explanation in regard to it from the Minister, I think we should not give the Bill a Second Reading.  There is no advantage in giving it a Second Reading now if it is to be deferred until the next session.  I think the better course would be to defer discussion or even an explanation until the new Session. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps I was wrong in putting forward what was   only a personal point of view.  My own outlook is that this Bill is eminently a Committee Bill.  I would not propose to take any part in a Second Reading debate when on Committee I might have suggestions to make for an alteration of the Bill. As to the advantage of taking a Second Reading now, I had an eye on the sort of situation that is apt to arise at the beginning of a Session when, for the first week, there is a dearth of business until legislation gets going and a certain number of Bills have been dealt with on Second Reading and the ordinary process of business of the Session commences.  If the Second Reading of this bill were taken to-day we could take up the Committee Stage when the House re-assembles in November.  If there is any objection to taking the Second Reading I have no keen interest in rushing it. 
     
     
      
       My point is that the Bill purports to change a very old-established law regarding the holding of coroners' inquests with the aid of a jury.  That is a very vital change. We are asked to give the Bill a Second Reading&mdash;that is, to approve the principle of the Bill&mdash;without any explanation or discussion.  I think that is undesirable and I oppose the Second Reading on that ground only. 
     
     
      
       In that case I suggest that the Order be discharged and we can take the Second Reading after the Recess. 
       Order discharged accordingly. Second Reading to be taken when the House re-assembles after the recess. 
     
   
   
     INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY (PROTECTION) BILL, 1926. 
     
      
       I am not prepared to move the First Reading of the new Bill to-day. 
       Order discharged. 
     
   
   
     TRADE LOANS (GUARANTEE) (AMENDMENT) BILL, 1926.&mdash;FIFTH STAGE. 
     
      
       I move: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo; 
       Question put and agreed to. 
     
   
   
     SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Go dtugaidh an Dail cead chun go dtarbhfar isteach na Meastachain Bhreise seo leanas i gcoir seirbhise na bliana dar crioch an 31adh la de Mharta, 1927, eadhon:&mdash;Votanna a 57 (Boithre Iarainn), 63 (An tArm). 
       That leave be given by the Dail to introduce the following Supplementary Estimates for the service of the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, viz.:&mdash;Votes 57 (Railways), 63 (Army). 
       The total amount involved comes to about £13,000. 
       Leave granted. 
     
     
      
       When is it proposed to take the consideration of these Supplementary Estimates in Committee? 
     
     
      
       They are being circulated and perhaps the Dail will agree to consider them after we have disposed of the Betting Bill. 
       Ordered accordingly. 
     
   
   
     BETTING BILL, 1926&mdash;FOURTH AND FIFTH STAGES. 
     
      
       I move the following amendment:&mdash; 
       In page 3, section 4 (b), line 33, to delete the words &ldquo;or any other Act,&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Act or any Act relating to gaming or gaming houses.&rdquo; 
       The provision in the Bill sets out that one of the reasons for the refusal of a certificate to a person on the ground of fitness is that the applicant has been convicted for an offence under the Betting Act or any other Act.  We are narrowing that so that it will be in relation to an Act relating to gaming or gaming houses, so that if a person were convicted the offence would be an offence that had a definite relation to his behaviour in matters connected with his business. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       In page 4, Section 8, before paragraph (g) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash; 
     
     
       &ldquo;(g)  that the premises are registered in the register of bookmaking premises and during such registration irregularities had occurred owing to the close proximity of the premises to premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor.&rdquo; 
     This amendment is to meet the point raised by Deputy Johnson with reference to licensed premises.  I think the words proposed are as far as we could go. 
     Amendment agreed to. 
     
      
       I move Amendments 3 and 4:&mdash; 
       In page 4, Section 8 (h), line 64, to delete the word &ldquo;therein&rdquo; and after the word &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; in the same line, to add the words &ldquo;in or outside the premises.&rdquo; 
       In page 5, Section 8 (i), line 4, to delete the word &ldquo;therein,&rdquo; and after the word &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;in or outside such premises.&rdquo; 
       This alters the provision of the Bill making it a cause of objection that the business had been so carried on as to encourage persons to congregate or loiter therein in large numbers.  We propose to alter that to &ldquo;causing persons to congregate and loiter in or outside the premises.&rdquo; 
       Amendments agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill, as amended, be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       That the provisions of Standing Order 88 as to the giving of notice for the taking of the Fifth Stage of a Bill be suspended to permit of the Fifth Stage of the Betting Bill, 1926, being taken to-day. 
       Question put and agreed to. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Bill ordered to be sent to the Seanad. 
     
   
   
     IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - MONEY RESOLUTION&mdash;TARIFF COMMISSION BILL, 1926. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
     
     Go bhfuil se oiriunach a udaru go   n-iocfar amach as airgead a sholathroidh an tOireachtas costaisi Coimisiun na nDleacht maraon le luach saothair bhaill agus oifigigh an Choimisiuin, agus gach costas eile a bhainfidh le haon Acht do chur i bhfeidhm a rithfar sa tsioson so chun socru do dheanamh chun Coimisiun do bhunu chun tuairse do thabhairt don Aire Airgid maidir le tairisginti chun diuitethe custum d'fhorchur ar earrai a hiomportaltar isteach i Saorstat Eireann no chun iad d'atharu no d'athnuachaint agus chun imeachta an Choimisiuin sin do regleail agus i gcoir rudai eile a bhaineas leis na nithe sin. 
     That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of the expenses of the Tariff Commission, including the remuneration of the members and officers of the Commission and all other expenses of carrying into execution any Act of the present Session to provide for the establishment of a Commission to report to the Minister for Finance on proposals for the imposition, modification, or renewal of customs duties on the importation of goods into Saorstat Eireann and to regulate the proceedings of such Commission, and for other matters connected therewith. 
     Deputies will notice that in the Resolution provision is made for the payment of expenses, including the remuneration of the members and officers of the Commission.  An amendment will be proposed to the Bill making it clear that salaries may be paid to members of the Commission in case persons not in the Civil Service are appointed members of the Commission. 
     
      
       This motion is asking the Dail to agree to providing the money whereby the work of the proposed Tariff Commission can be carried out.  Therefore this motion in effect asks us to agree that the work of the Tariff Commission is worth the expenses that are proposed to be voted.  In the first place I want just to raise a point that the motion speaks of a Commission appointed by the Minister for Finance. 
     
     
     
      
       A Commission reporting to the Minister for Finance. 
     
     
      
       Yes, to report to the Minister for Finance.  At a later stage I will endeavour to persuade the House that a Commission of the kind, if it is to do the work&mdash;not the work which it proposes to do, but which many of those who support the Bill think it proposes to do&mdash;will be concerned with matters which have special reference to industry and commerce, to the development of industry, the revival of commerce, and the improvement of economic conditions with respect to industries.  But the reference in the motion of the Minister for Finance suggests right at the beginning that this is a Bill primarily directed at raising revenue, that it is a revenue producing Bill, not a Bill to encourage and develop industries or having advertence to the development of industries, but aiming at revenue.  I think that is the effect of the Bill.  But it indicates a line of approach.  I draw attention to the defect in the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo; here, which will also come up for discussion later.  I draw attention to it because by one, and I think, the more generally accepted interpretation of the word &ldquo;modification,&rdquo; the Commission would be confined to considering proposals for reductions, or, rather, shall I say, would be excluded from considering proposals for enlarging or increasing. Now, modification would be generally interpreted to mean an alteration by way of reduction, not an alteration by way of increase.  If the purposes of the Commission are to be such as some of the Deputies pretend to believe, they would be precluded from any question of a possible increase in the duty.  That again, as I say, will come forward again, and I am assuming that the passing of this resolution in the present form will not preclude the discussion of that aspect of the Bill.  As I say, the resolution which is now before us is one asking us to agree to the payment of moneys for the purpose of carrying out certain work, and inferentially it asks us to say that the work which the Commission is going to carry out will be worth the prospective expenditure.   I think in answering that question we are bound to consider what purpose the Commission has, and what the purpose of the expenditure is.  It is to inquire into the applications made by persons interested in the promotion of industries or in the development of existing industries. 
     
     
      
       And looking for concessions. 
     
     
      
       And looking for concessions.  I say now, as I said before, that that is an indication of the wrong spirit in which to approach this question.  In effect it is a denunciation of the idea, that an industry might be protected or assisted by a tariff on imports for the general good, that it is only a matter which can be approached as a matter of personal interest.  It is because of the approach to the whole question that is shown by this Bill that I am distinctly opposed to it.  I recognise, and I have recognised for a good many years, that there are dangers to the public well-being, apart from political activities, in import duties.  The chance of life is a danger, but a danger that can beguarded against.  But very much depends upon the spirit in which legislation of this kind is introduced, enacted, and, particularly, administered.  If we begin our examination of such questions and our proposals with regard to tariff by assuming that they are matters of private, personal, pecuniary interest only to the persons making the application, we are practically relegating the whole subject to the pull and drag of competing interests, and are asking the various sections of the community to perpetuate that evil thing in the social and economic life which assumes that everything is to be considered from the point of view of personal interests. 
     
     I was challenged yesterday by more than one Deputy to state where I stood on this question.  I do not know whether that was intended seriously, whether the Deputies did not realise the possibility that there are grades between pure black and pure white, and that everything had not been done when one has attached to oneself a label, and that it is enough for a legislator or any public man to say: &ldquo;Well, I stand for protection,&rdquo;&ldquo;I stand for   free trade,&rdquo;&ldquo;I stand for subsidies,&rdquo;&ldquo;I stand for bounties,&rdquo; and let that be the final word in the matter and that nothing more need be said or thought&mdash;that once you attach to yourself a label everything else will follow automatically and there need not be any more thinking.  I am not amongst those who appear to imagine, when they have said freedom of trade is the ideal, perfect fluidity between country and country and population and population&mdash;perfect fluidity of capital movement&mdash;and that that country which is best fitted for economic development will inevitably, in a state of perfect fluidity, and free exchange, survive, and the world's wealth and trade thereby reach its maximum. Nor am I of opinion that at any cost imports should be debarred provided there is even a posibility of goods of a similar character being produced within the country.  But I look at the problem of Ireland in 1926 and the period and life of this generation and its prospects economically.  I am frankly refusing to consider this matter from the point of view of the labouring man or the artizan in a particular trade or occupation.  I ask the farmers to refuse to look upon this merely as a matter affecting the farmers of Ireland in 1926.  I ask the merchants and manufacturers not to think of this problem as affecting their own industries in this particular year, or the year that may be current at the time they give consideration to it. When looking at the situation in Ireland to-day and the situation economically in other countries I recognise very big problems ahead.  I want to dispel the idea that you have got to think of industries as entities and living things in themselves, which you should bow down to and worship, but rather that these industries are activities and organisations whose function it it to supply the needs of humanity.  It is the human effect of any political or economic change that we can bring about by any method that we have to consider. 
     I realise quite well that if the farmer is going to look at the interests of farming&mdash;or rather, shall I say of his particular brand of farming?&mdash;for   this year and next year only, he may well say that it is impolitic, but really meaning not advantageous to himself, that there should be no risk run of the prices of any commodity that he purchases being raised.  From the purely selfish standpoint that is understandable. Similarly, if I take the railwayman and the docker, I can understand such a man saying: &ldquo;If by any action the State limits the weight and quantity of certain classes of manufactured articles coming into this country, it will reduce my potential earnings and consequently I am going to oppose any change.&rdquo;  On the other hand, manufacturers may say to themselves: &ldquo;It is not worth my while going into this question of tariffs.  I am carrying on very well.  I am living an easy, comfortable life, and I am not going to put myself to the trouble of making a claim for a tariff.&rdquo;  Following that selfish instinct, refusing to consider the effect of any political or economic change upon the national life, he remains quiescent and he refuses to make any plea or interest himself in the question of any change in the economic or fiscal scheme.  I contend that in approaching this question the Government has declared, not merely by accident but has reiterated its determination through the mouth of the Minister for Finance yesterday, that this whole question shall be considered from the point of view of an individual application, that the individual must make a case in favour of a concession, a concession by the State to himself and his fellow-industrialists. And as the matter stands, if he cannot make a case there is no national interest to be considered.  I say that that is an utterly wrong approach, and so wrong is it that I think the passing of this Bill and the character that has been impressed upon it even by the Second Reading division, the character that has been impressed upon the whole question, is practically the first step to inviting all sections of the community to consider this subject in the future from the point of view of pull and drag and of seeking merely individual pecuniary benefit for themselves. 
     
        If there is one objection that outstands more than another against a scheme of tariffs on import goods, that objection, to my mind, lies in the risk of degradation of a legislature, or merchants and manufacturers, by the system of pulling and pushing, dragging, cajoling and bribing that may come into the scheme of things under a tariff if it is not safeguarded. That, I think, is probably one of the greatest risks in a tariff system.  It has been guarded against in some countries.  In other countries, on the other hand, we know that proposals regarding tariff changes are looked upon as a good opportunity for all kinds of graft and all kinds of corruption. I am of opinion that the way the Government has approached the question in this Bill tends distinctly to lower the level on which the matter should be discussed in this country.  I think the line that should have been taken would be for a responsible Ministry to say: &ldquo;A case has been made; we ourselves are satisfied that the national interest is likely to be well served by a particular tariff or group of tariffs.&rdquo;  If any question is raised as to any exception or any question as to the possible reactions, then refer that question to an inquiry, but first of all let them say: &ldquo;We have decided,&rdquo; not on the application of an interested party, &ldquo;that the national well-being will be served&rdquo; by this or that proposal, and having satisfied themselves that a  prima facie  case has been made, that they could submit that matter to a Commission of Inquiry for further examination and not consider it as a matter of a concession which somebody has to pay for. 
     I do not believe that the imposition of protective tariffs of themselves will bring about that ideal industrial condition in the country that some people would be inclined to agree with.  On the other hand, I recognise that there is need for positive State assistance to encourage the development of industrial activities in the country.  Examining all possible ways of so encouraging industrial activities in this country, taking into account the state of public opinion, the comparatively backward state of industrial   organisation, the lack of industrial and administrative experience&mdash;taking all these things into account&mdash;and having very carefully examined this matter from the point of view of the national well-being, I have personally come to the conclusion that tariffs on imported manufactured goods are necessary and should be extended.  I have examined the question with the advantage of having heard frequently the views of the Ministry and particularly the views of the Minister for Agriculture.  I have examined the arguments put forward on behalf of the farmers represented here in the Farmers' Party, and I go a long way in the belief that the future of the country will largely depend on development in agricultural production. I also think that a very great deal of that improvement will depend upon the extent to which better marketing, better quality of goods, greater quantities of live stock and live stock products, can be produced and sold both inside and outside the country. 
     Supposing the whole advantage that is foreseen from that line of development is secured, supposing the scheme of redistribution of population succeeds within the next 25 years in improving the general life of the present congests and the poorer farmers of the country, supposing the quality of all agricultural products is greatly improved&mdash; the breed of cattle and even the output &mdash;supposing all that is accomplished and a much bigger financial return is secured by the agricultural population, that, as I say, will be the fulfilment of the hopes of the farmers and Minister for Agriculture.  What has been accomplished then?  We have been told on similar authority that the land is carrying as many as it can bear reasonably. Consequently any improvement in the agricultural condition is not to be expected from that quarter, from any increase in the number of people living directly upon agriculture. 
     In following out the farmers' policy, which is purely an agricultural policy, we have to assume that the new produce is going to be marketed outside the country and the increased earnings obtained by the agricultural population are going to be spent where the best value can be secured.  That is to say   that the policy outlined is to improve agriculture technically, to improve the output, to sell that improved output in Great Britain or elsewhere, to spend the income on manufactured articles wherever they can be bought at the lowest price. 
     What, then, is to become of our town population?  What, then, is to become of your increasing human population from the land?  Are you going to add to the numbers of persons engaged in the providing of circuses?  What is going to be done with your increased material possessions?  You are going to purchase all the things you can purchase cheaply, outside the country. Let us not forget in this review that every modern tendency is towards cheapness, is to produce articles of a standardized pattern, so that in the future the great probability is that even in the building of your new barns and improved agricultural buildings, which we will assume will come from the improved return from agriculture, you will introduce the standardized article&mdash; perhaps steel, perhaps some other compound which will come forth in the course of invention and discovery&mdash;and that these, too, will be imported, and that the only persons who can possibly look for any advantage in the way of employment and occupation will be the mere assembler and unskilled labourer. That is the tendency.  There is no prospect under these conditions of developing industrially.  We may have a considerable number of men engaged in repair work of one kind or another, which is the most productive occupation in the towns to-day. 
     Again I ask you to bear in mind this tendency, and to realise that repair work is becoming less and less because of the fact that commodities are being standardised, and the firm that makes the original article is going to provide the spare parts.  When I take this tendency into account, when I take a view of the position as it is developing, I can see no prospect for this country maintaining a population in comfort, outside agriculture, except in an unhealthy direction.  I can conceive well of a prosperous agricultural community spending its moderate surplus   upon pleasures, and on the other hand the country being developed from the point of view of a pleasure ground, and the urban third of the population and a considerable proportion of the rural two-thirds being attuned and conforming themselves to the cap-in-the hand-touch-for-a-tip kind of population.  I do not want to decry for a moment the pecuniary advantages of tourist development or the advantages of amusements and amenities, but I say it is not a good and sound development to put before the country as a prospect, to say that you are going to have developed a fairly comfortable apricultural population, not extending in numbers but extending in comfort, with no other production in the country and with such urban population as remains engaged in the transportation to and fro of imports and exports, or satisfying the demand for pleasure of either the agricultural population or the persons that come into the country seeking pleasure. 
     This, of course, is an old doctrine. There is nothing new about it.  Many people in the Dail have preached it many times, but it will stand restatement. I think it stands restatement, more especially at the present time, when we have to ask ourselves, if we are satisfied that it is desirable to encourage industrial life, if only for the creation of variety, how best that can be done.  I believe it is only possible to do it by assisting, by fostering such movements towards improvement, such attempts to become rooted as may be showing themselves on the part of industries, and not allow to be wiped out such industries as still remain with us. 
     It is also a doctrine preached on the Ministerial Benches that the State ought to afford some of the cost of this line of progress. Are we doing the best in that direction by the lines suggested in this Bill?  I think we are doing quite the contrary.  You say you are going to set up a Commission to examine into all the details and possible reactions of any proposals that come forward   from those seeking after concessions. I think this step is distinctly setting up a barrier against the possibility of State assistance, State fostering, and State protection by way of Customs duty, for these delicate industries or industries that require some help. 
     I do not think that the money that we are asked to assent to being spent would be worth spending. On the other hand, if it is spent in the way projected I think it will be harmful and will retard the development which I have outlined.  I am going to ask the Dail to refuse to support this motion and, at a later stage, to amend the Bill in some way; at least to remove some of the defects which I think are contained in it.  I believe that there is a good deal of misunderstanding about the purpose and probable effect of this measure.  Whatever misunderstanding there may be in the Dail about it, there is a great deal more misunderstanding outside.  I said what I have said because I want to make it clear that I am opposing this Bill because I believe it is calculated to prevent a fair examination of a proposal for the imposition of a tariff.  I believe it will prevent the examination of any such proposal which may be put forward solely out of regard for the national well-being, and it will only secure the examination of a proposal which is put forward on behalf of men who are seeking pecuniary advantage for themselves. That is my main objection to the Bill.  I have different views from some who opposed the Bill regarding the composition of the Commission.  I think if the Commission were given a useful function no harm would come to it if there were men appointed from the Civil Service.  But I believe that it is distinctly harmful to ask men who are to-day engaged in, let us say, an examination of a problem that arises out of a strike or a problem arising out of income tax or arising out of the nonpayment of unemployment insurance stamps and health insurance stamps and things like that, to inquire tomorrow into an application made, perhaps, by the very firm which to-day they have had to withstand or to oppose or prosecute.   That I think is a distinct objection.  I have no objection to the filling of the post of tariff commissioner from the Civil Service provided that that tariff commissioner is given a proper function and has of necessity a whole-time occupation. 
     
      
       Deputy Johnson has handed in certain amendments to the Money Resolution.  Is he moving them? 
     
     
      
       Yes, Sir.  I think it would be wise to move them. 
     
     
      
       Could they not be moved in Committee? 
     
     
      
       If I could be sure that the passing of the Resolution in its present form would not preclude a discussion of it in Committee then I should not move the amendments at this stage.  I only feared that if I did not put forward the amendments, and if the motion was passed in its present form, it might preclude the possibility of a discussion on the Committee Stage. 
     
     
      
       The Money Resolution provides for the establishment of a commission to report to the Minister for Finance.  I would be prepared to agree that an amendment to substitute for the Minister for Finance another Executive Minister would be in order.  It would not, of course, be in order to substitute for the Minister for Finance a Minister who is not a member of the Executive Council &mdash;to seek to have the commission to report, for example, to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. 
     
     
      
       I wish it were. 
     
     
      
       With regard to the word &ldquo;modification,&rdquo; unless some substantial case is put to me that the word has some special restrictive meaning I would accept an amendment in committee to substitute the word &ldquo;alteration.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       In that case I will not move the amendments at this stage. 
     
     
     
      
       I would have preferred if this Tariff Commission was appointed with a view to the national situation, but I am supporting the measure because, at all events, we are setting up a Tariff Commission.  I think it is unfortunate that this Tariff Commission should inquire into all those vital things from the point of view of a single industry or a single individual. That is not the conception of protection usually entertained in this country and in most countries.  At all events, under this Bill we are to have a Tariff Commission that will gather the vital facts of each industry, and that is one step further on the way to the protection that some of us desire.  I claim it is the first victory won for protection, but there is a long way yet to go before protection is handled in this country as it is handled in every country in the world that has adopted it.  This thing of directing attention to the case made by an industry has a great many drawbacks.  In the first place, as was pointed out, an industry might be flourishing in one county; it might be paying its way and the owners might be making a modest dividend, so that there might be no need for them to get a tariff from the point of view of the industry.  But considering that there was no such industry in the surrounding counties; that there was any amount of unemployment in the surrounding counties, and that foreign goods were supplying the consumption in those counties, I think that an idea of tariffs that left an industry unprotected and did not provide for employment in a large area is a very inadequate measure of protection.  It shows that we are only going a part of the way and that we have a long way to go still.  But as it is a step on the way I think those who are in favour of protection ought to support it. We are aware in the case of an industry that got protection, there was an influx of foreign capital into this city, and employment was provided for 500 or 600 boys and girls.  If the people in that industry had come before this Tariff Commission to make their case from the point of view of their own industry, they never would get a tariff. 
     
     
     
      
       Why? 
     
     
      
       Because they may be making a profit in a limited area. 
     
     
      
       Would you not give consideration to a future applicant on the same grounds?  You are accepting the &ldquo;poisoned pup&rdquo;; that is what you are doing. 
     
     
      
       I am not as good a judge of pups as Deputy Byrne.  It has been stated also by members of the Farmers' Party that tariffs inevitably mean an increase in prices.  They do not inevitably mean that. 
     
     
      
       Stated by the Minister for Finance. 
     
     
      
       I did not interrupt Deputy Baxter.  If he allows me to make my speech I will answer any questions that he desires to ask.  I am going to leave Deputy Baxter's prophecies aside and deal with facts.  Take the case of cigarettes in Dublin.  There was a tariff put on them that gave employment to six or seven hundred boys and girls.  I am sure Deputy Baxter has no objection to that.  He has not to pay any more for his cigarettes.  That is a case in point.  Take the case of blankets. The entire import of blankets has been stopped.  The Irish mills have captured the entire trade, and the price of blankets has been reduced instead of being increased.  These are two outstanding facts. 
     
     
      
       Whose facts are they? 
     
     
      
       The facts belong to the whole community.  I have no monopoly of facts. 
     
     
      
       What about furniture? 
     
     
      
       I could quote more cases.  In Australia there were two States, one of which adopted protection and the other clung to free trade, and the prices of articles were not higher in the protected State than in the other State.  Because this question of protection in this instance is approached   from the point of view of industry you have men making imputations against Irish manufacturers. These manufacturers have had a terrible struggle for the last 40 or 50 years in this country, without any support whatever, against massed production from the other side&mdash;from a country with a large and wealthy population and with big plants.  Now because this State proposes tariffs to protect our badly-supported manufacturers you have nothing but flouts and jeers of the most insulting kind against our manufacturers.  They remind me of the flouts and jeers that were flung at the farmers long ago. 
     
     
      
       And that are still flung. 
     
     
      
       That is not so.  That is only an ignorant interruption.  I say even if the prices of commodities were increased there is in this country a justification for making an effort to set our factories on their feet, a justification for attempting to bring back work to our idle towns and idle villages and for attempting to stop emigration.  The question of emigration has been used on many a platform. It has been used so often that people jeer at it now as an argument, but it is no jeer for the parents who have to see their children leaving the country.  Anyone who has seen hundreds leaving from stations in the West of Ireland, going from a land where we have a big market that could keep our factories going, will understand that that jeer has very little heart or humanity in it.  These men and women are leaving this country to work in factories in other countries where the manufacturers do not jeer at them.  They are leaving the country that has a market to the extent of £16,000,000, which could keep them going.  But we prefer to keep the factories going in foreign countries, and we pay £16,000,000 for articles produced in those factories.  Even if we paid £18,000,000, £14,000,000 or £15,000,000 of it would be for salaries, wages and dividends.  We might well pay an additional one or two millions and the farmer would not suffer by it. The farmers through the country know   that well and they know that it would be well if they had places where their sons and daughters could go to work. Deputy Heffernan's and Deputy Baxter's point of view, I submit, is not the point of view of the intelligent farmer of this country.  There are farmers in this country who would be greatly exasperated if they were told that they object to the setting up of factories that would keep their brothers and sisters amongst them.  If they were told that that was their attitude they would not understand it.  I have here an expression of opinion from the farmers' side that I submit is more an authoritative expression of opinion than the opinion of Deputy Baxter or Deputy Heffernan.  It contrasts the quantities of imported goods of various categories which are consumed annually in Irish farmsteads with the complaints of native agriculturists as to the poor demand for their own products, and goes on: &ldquo;Imagine they would rate our intelligence and business acumen as hardly up to the level of a dog who lived on his own tail. Many people may be living on their wits in Ireland, but in some respects Irish farmers are not very strenuously exercising theirs.&rdquo;  I submit that is the point of view of the intelligent farmer of this country.  Does Deputy Baxter deny that? 
     
     
      
       Where is that farmer? 
     
     
      
       You agree with that? 
     
     
      
       Deputy Sears should not address Deputy Baxter. 
     
     
      
       That is a quotation from a leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Farmer,&rdquo; and those men buy and support the &ldquo;Irish Farmer&rdquo; and get it to preach to intelligent readers common-sense, intelligence and patriotism. Yet they come here and give the lie to every word of that. 
       I said that approaching this from the industrial point of view places the Irish manufacturer in an unenviable position.  Deputy Gorey said yesterday that you would see them gathering like files round the pot. 
     
     
     
      
       Round the honey. 
     
     
      
       Round the honey. Deputy Wilson knows that if he goes into the town of Wicklow he will see the shelves in the shops crammed with English manufactured goods and that his money goes to pay British and other artisans who will be able to buy goods with the wages they receive from employers who do not care a hang if Deputy Wilson and the Farmers' Party with him were at the bottom of the sea. We should look at this from a national point of view.  If it is worth fighting for this nation, if it is worth making a struggle to teach the nation the Irish language, are the people to be taught Irish in order to go to America and England?  Denmark is often quoted for us.  Denmark is governed by able and shrewd statesmen who do not say to the farmers, &ldquo;Look after your land and let the rest of the country go to the devil.&rdquo;  On the contrary, they say that it would be better to have factories in their own towns and they have made that their aim.  The farmer in Denmark is patriotic, like the Irish farmer who is not a rancher. 
     
     
      
       Have they any unemployment in Denmark? 
     
     
      
       I am glad Deputy Heffernan reminded me of that.  There is not emigration from Denmark on the scale we have here.  There are no stagnant, impoverished towns and villages in Denmark.  One-third of the people there are engaged in agriculture, and they have brought agriculture to the highest point in Europe, perhaps, with the poorest land.  Another one-third of the workers in Denmark are engaged in handicrafts.  That is all I ask for this country.  I do not care what the industries are, but we are entitled to have one-third of our young men and women engaged in industrial work.  We pay dearly for our work; we pay it in farmers' money, and we deprive farmers' sons and daughters of the work. Farmers come here and say, &ldquo;We will vote against opening the door to the employment of farmers' sons and daughters, against giving them a day's wages, against an outlet being given them.&rdquo;  English farmers' sons and   Danish farmers' sons get work; for the Irish farmers' sons and daughters there is Queenstown or poverty or the dole or half wages at home. 
     
     
      
       Cobh. 
     
     
      
       That is Deputy Baxter's policy: for the Irish farmers' second sons and daughters, the dole or Queenstown or poverty at home.  It is all very well for a man who has a farm of land &mdash;he is all right&mdash;but owing to a mistaken view of his own interests he is opposing tariffs.  What we should aim at is to get employment for one-third of our people who are at present idle.  I am not a doctrinaire protectionist.  I would prefer free trade if there was a fair chance for every man.  Asking Irish manufacturers to compete against powerful competitors from Bradford and elsewhere is like asking an untrained man to enter the ring against Carpentier.  All we ask is that the Irish manufacturer should get time to get on his feet; that he should get the same protection that the undeveloped manufactures in other countries got. We had Deputy Wilson yesterday asking us to pity the agricultural industry standing alone.  Why not have other industries along with the agricultural industry, and not leave it to stand alone? 
     
     In our towns we have five shops doing the work of one.  If there were factories set up you would only have one shop in the place of five shops.  You would save the four shops at the expense of the English manufacturer and the cost of them would be taken off the Irish farmer. We have set up a Commission to try and prevent profiteering.  Our towns are crowded with shops swelling the cost of distribution and increasing the burden on the farmer, and you have the Farmers' Party here opposing a measure that would reduce the burden on the farmers and enable factories to be set up that would bear their share of the rates and taxes.  The farmers would not then be in the unfortunate position of coming here and saying that they are the only people paying rates and taxes.  I think the Farmers' Party are mistaken in their view.  The   Government Party have been twitted with having differences of opinion. Some time ago we were twitted because we were all voting so well. 
     
      
       You are still voting well. 
     
     
      
       We are still voting well.  Deputy Wilson can say that his Party are voting well too.  Deputy Hewat yesterday confessed that it is beginning to dawn on the big business men in Dublin that this policy of importing goods is not altogether a happy situation for any country.  He confessed that it is a bit of a failure as far as the business community are concerned. Farmers admit that conditions are bad with them, but they will not allow any effort to be made to help them.  I think the farmers are unwise in their attitude. 
     
     
      
       I wonder could we get away from discussing the farmers? 
     
     
      
       We do not mind. 
     
     
      
       It is very amusing. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Sears' economics are not such as to require any comment from me.  With regard to the resolution, I will try to clarify the position that our Party stands in in regard to it, as it is necessary to make the position clear.  This resolution, following on the Bill which got a Second Reading yesterday, asks us to accept a policy that we are not prepared to accept, but we do not want to be interpreted as being against an inquiry into the whole position in regard to tariffs and assistance to industries&mdash;what it is possible to do for them, what assistance they can get, what the cost to the State is to be, and how that assistance is to be given.  If the Executive Council came to the Dail with a proposition to set up a Tariff Commission in the real sense, to inquire into the whole position of industries and their future, and if the position was to be examined fully and completely along the lines pursued by, let us say, the Liquor Commission or the Food Prices Commission or, as has been customary with any other Commission set up, and if it meant an inquiry into all the facts and possibilities   and was not committing us to what the Minister said very definitely yesterday this Bill committed us, we would not stand against the setting up of such a Commission.  We candidly confess that an examination of the whole industrial position would be beneficial. No matter what the very agile Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or his lieutenants may suggest about the pro-nationalism of certain individuals, nothing that he can say will take from the farmers' national outlook, and we are not a bit alarmed by comments like that.  We are as sympathetic to the State, to nationalism and to Irish industries as any Irishman could be, but when we are asked to swallow all that the advocates on the other side urge on us, we do not know exactly what they propose.  Two cases were presented, one by one group in a particular party and another by another group.  The Minister for Finance told us that the acceptance of a Tariff Commission was saying good-bye to the policy of free trade. 
     
     
      
       I used an adjective there, which the Deputy has left out. 
     
     
      
       What is it? 
     
     
      
       &ldquo;Doctrinaire.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       I put in the adjective&mdash;doctrinaire free trade, or any other name you may give it.  When we have a statement like that from the Minister, following another statement by the same Minister when introducing the Budget in 1925, that this Government would not break any further fresh ground in the matter of protective tariffs before the general election, I want to express a little surprise that more stress was not laid by Deputies on these statements of the Minister. When the Minister makes a statement like that on an important occasion and makes it in order to ward off certain criticism that would be forthcoming if that policy was to be further pursued, is it not to be understood as a serious, well-meant, honest statement, made after full consideration and examination of all the facts?  Is the standard of political honesty that is to be set up in this House to be such that a Minister can make a statement on   one occasion and get acquiescence in his policy because of his statement, and then when it suits him to change and alter that policy, have no hesitation in doing so? The Minister in 1925, I suggest, knew just as much as he knows to-day about the position of the industries that he says, or other people say, are in dire stress.  The information was before him from the officials in his Department whose duty it was to put those facts before him, and I suggest that his statement was made following an examination of those facts.  In what way have the conditions altered?  To say the least of it, that is not a practice that can be commended on the part of Ministers. 
       With regard to the work of the Commission, I say undoubtedly that an examination of the whole problem will be helpful to everyone.  I recognise, on the other hand, the great difficulties there are and will be confronting any Commission in examining fully both sides of the case, because, as Deputy Heffernan said the other day, no Commission will have put before it the disadvantages of tariffs in the way that the advantages will be put before it. Can we expect from the Commission an impartial decision if all the facts are not submitted to them? That difficulty, I suggest, will always confront any Commission.  But if a body were to be set up to examine the problem, such as Deputy Johnson has suggested, some good would come from it, and I suggest that some valuable information would be obtained.  The Executive Council may take it that if that did not carry with it the acceptance of the policy of protection, there would be no objection whatever on the part of the Farmers' Party to setting up such a Commission and to voting the money necessary. 
     
     
      
       May I ask if the Deputy is drawing a sharp distinction between a general inquiry and a piecemeal inquiry?  What I mean by a piecemeal inquiry is an inquiry into the desirability or otherwise of the application of a tariff to a specific commodity.  I rather gathered from his opening statement and his going back on it now, that he is drawing a   distinction and stating that, whereas on the one hand he would favour the general inquiry, he feels compelled to oppose and vote against a piecemeal inquiry such as he says is contemplated by the provisions of the Bill. 
     
     
      
       The Minister for Finance made a definite statement that no tariffs were to be imposed, that no fresh ground was to be broken pending a general election.  In introducing this Bill, however, the Minister pointed out that the acceptance of it meant the acceptance of the policy of protection.  I am pointing out that if he introduced a Bill that did not carry with it the acceptance of such a principle, the position from the point of view of our Party would be different. If the problem is to be examined at all, it ought to be fully and fairly examined and not examined in such a way as to prejudice the position, which is what this Bill means.  There can be no proper examination of the problem if the position of our industries is not very fully and carefully gone into.  I repeat now what I said before, that it is an accepted fact&mdash;and I think Ministers themselves admit it&mdash;that industries cannot be either reorganised here or new industries be brought into existence, if the present policy of the industrialists and others connected with them is to be pursued, without the cost being paid by the people of the State.  The Minister for Finance stated definitely that tariffs meant an increase in the cost of the protected articles. The Minister for Justice does not contradict that, and every sensible person knows that that is the fact to-day.  Is it unjust on the part of the farmers' representatives to look at this problem from the point of view of the individuals engaged in their own particular industry?  Is it selfish, is it unfair to the nation?  If the people of the State are to pay the cost of new industries being brought into existence, and if the people are prepared to accept the responsibility.  I am prepared to accept that proposition. but as we know the conditions in agriculture to-day, we feel that the agriculturists are not able to face up to that position and carry on their industry. 
     
     
     
      
       Would the Deputy answer this question?  His contention is that the farmers at present are the sole producers and practically bear the whole cost of the rest of the community. Does he prefer that that burden shall be borne without any assistance from other producers; that is to say, that inasmuch as all the people are being supported out of the farmers' production, would it not be better if the sixty or seventy or eighty thousand unemployed found employment and became less of a burden than they are as unemployed? 
     
     
      
       To answer Deputy Johnson's question I have to digress slightly from the case I am immediately dealing with.  Of course it would be better if fifty or sixty thousand people out of employment were employed and we would welcome the possibility of their being employed, which would be a great relief.  But I want to ask Deputy Johnson or anybody else to answer me this question: What industries are in being into which these fifty or sixty thousand unemployed are prepared to walk to-day and to give such service and skilled labour as will be possible for that industry to carry on unless you put up such a tariff upon the same class of articles coming into the country from abroad as will exclude them coming into the Free State from any other country? 
     
     
      
       The financial burden would not be any greater. 
     
     
      
       I confess we have not the figures before us or the evidence as to the number of unemployed in this city to-day who are sufficiently skilled in any trade or occupation to qualify them to walk into a factory, take their places there, and give such service, and only claim for their work what that work is worth on the market in competition with the products of similar industry elsewhere or here where skilled workers are engaged. 
     
     
      
       If you had your way they never would be skilled. 
     
     
      
       Has Deputy Baxter ever visited Ford's works in Cork? 
     
     
      
       Has the Deputy   ever considered how many could be employed in the milling industry and the chemical manure industry where no technique is necessary?  Has he given that matter any consideration? 
     
     
      
       I am prepared for any amount of cross-examination. 
     
     
      
       I am not prepared for any cross-examination, and I will not have the Deputy cross-examined at all to-day. 
     
     
      
       As farmers see the proposition they are up against they have to consider that they have to try to live and carry on their industry. We see no future for our industry unless each individual is able to manage and pay his way and support his family. 
     
     
      
       What about the relief of the rates? 
     
     
      
       What about the subsidies? 
     
     
      
       Let the Deputy make his case. 
     
     
      
       Let me tell Deputy Dolan that if he goes down to his own constituency in Leitrim and asks how the people lived before they got this additional grant&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       But they got it. 
     
     
      
       Yes, they got it out of their own pockets and it was long overdue.  Whom have they to thank for what was due to them in equity for a long time? 
     
     
      
       From what source did they get it? 
     
     
      
       Out of their own pocket.  We are in the position to-day that we find it very difficult to make our industry pay its way.  What are the facts?  Perhaps Deputy Dolan and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will take notice of these figures.  To-day in the market fat cattle realise 47/3 cwt.; in 1925 53/6; in 1924 52/6; in 1920 100/-.  To-day fat sheep are 54/3; in 1925 64/3; and fat lambs this year are 58/6, and in 1925 they were 78/-, and so on.  In face of these conditions   and these facts we are now up against a proposition which means this: are we prepared out of our limited resources to hand over further sums in order that certain industries may be brought into existence here?  We submit the position for us is such that we cannot do it.  Let me say to Deputy Johnson that when he makes a statement that the attitude of the farmers is that their lives are so comfortable that they refuse to make any sacrifice&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       That is not what I said.  I was assuming the possible success of the new policy where we would have arrived at a stage when the farmers would be very comfortable and easy. 
     
     
      
       We hope that such a stage will soon be reached, but let me say to Deputy Johnson that he misunderstands the psychology of the Irish farmer if he thinks that, when conditions improve for him, he will be prepared to rest upon his oars and take things easy for the future.  No other class in this State has made a better effort against adversity to hold its own and to improve its position through all those times than the farming class. 
     
     
      
       That is not the point at all.  The Deputy has quite misunderstood. I made no suggestion that the farmer was not a perfect citizen and that prosperity when it came to him would not leave him still a perfect citizen.  My question is what is to happen to the other section of the population? 
     
     
      
       Deputy Johnson's suggestion is that when the maximum of production is reached and when we have got better education and better conditions than we have up to the present time, the Irish farmer will not be prepared to make any sacrifice to make the State better and to make life fuller than it is at present.  Let me say that we would not be here to-day but for the few years of prosperity that the Irish farmers have had during the war which put them in a position that they had not been in for   a generation.  It was the generosity, courage, and spirit of self-sacrifice shown everywhere, when men were prepared to give money and to give their homes and lives to change conditions here, that made it possible for us to be here to-day.  Deputy Johnson need not suggest that every spark of patriotism will desert the Irish farmer if prosperity comes to him, but if Deputy Johnson expects at the same time that he is going to get blood from a stone he will be disappointed.  It simply is not there, and that is our attitude upon this question.  I would like to say to Deputy Davin that I think he misunderstood me in the case I made in replying to a question which came from the Labour benches.  I was asked what would I do for the unemployed to-day.  I challenged the Deputies to give us the numbers in the unemployed ranks who if they were able to obtain work could take their places in factories which we would all like to see here.  Unfortunately the position we have inherited is such that we have not the technical training or skill that makes it possible for us to do this and to hold our own.  The same may be said to a considerable extent perhaps of our Irish farmers.  But we have to carry on.  What good would I be in a beet factory or would Deputy Davin be or thousands of unemployed? Deputy Davin knows that money needed for the relief of unemployment could be better spent through the administration of the Acts passed by this House than in the building up of factories which could not be accomplished in a year or two years. 
     
     
      
       Does the Deputy suggest that it would be impossible to find suitable workers for the beet factory in Carlow? 
     
     
      
       If Deputy Davin is going to solve the unemployment problem in this country by giving employment in sugar beet factories, many hundred sugar beet factories would be required in this country. 
     
     
      
       That is not an answer. 
     
     
      
       I cannot give the number that will be employed in the   sugar beet factory, but the number is going to be very small, and of the number employed I suggest that some will be from the country and some will not. I suggest that what we can do for the unemployed under the legislation we have passed must necessarily be temporary&mdash;it may be for a few years&mdash;but we must recognise, on the other hand, that if our people are to hold their own they must be trained to take their places in factories.  If that is not done we must have tariffs which will mean increasing the cost of living.  What does it mean in the end?  It means increasing the cost of living and the cost of production, and decreasing the possibility of the Irish farmer meeting his competitors as he is doing to-day and holding the State together. 
     
     
      
       I think it is apparent now that it would not be possible to finish the Committee Stage of this Bill unless we are prepared to sit until 10.30 to-night.  I think that is not desirable, and I do not propose to move to sit late.  If we are to deal with the Committee Stage next week I shall have to move to take the Report Stage without delay afterwards, because it is necessary that the Bill should go to the Seanad as soon as possible. 
     
     
      
       I want to know in connection with Section 3 of this Bill are the people interested to be represented by counsel? 
     
     
      
       That will depend upon the Commission. 
     
     
      
       Upon the Commission? Is that a proper way of doing it?  Apparently the method of submitting evidence, the method of finding out the truth or value of the statements made is to be left to the Commission.  I think it should be determined in the first instance by the Dail. 
     
     
      
       That is a Committee point. 
     
     
      
       I thought the Deputy was going to make some remark about the further taking of the Committee Stage. 
     
     
      
       No, I was following Deputy Baxter. 
     
     
        The Dail went out of Committee. 
     Progress reported.

       That a return be presented showing:&mdash; 
       (a)  the debit or credit balances shown in the accounts of the several Boards of Guardians and District Councils of Donegal for the financial year ended 31st March, 1921; 
       (b)  the expenditure incurred by the Letterkenny, Donegal, Stranorlar, Ballyshannon, Milford, Inishowen, Dunfanaghy, and Glenties Boards of Guardians for the administrative year 1920-21; 
       (c)  the separate sums required in respect of County Donegal by Derry and Strabane Guardians for the administrative year 1920-21. 
     
     
      
       I think we might dispose of that by saying that the Minister is getting the information, and it will be forwarded to the Deputy. 
     
   
   
     IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - MONEY RESOLUTION&mdash;TARIFF COMMISSION BILL, 1926.   DEBATE RESUMED. 
     The Dail went into Committee on Finance. 
     
      
       I do not like the atmosphere that has been introduced here. I do not think we are helping the position by sneering at each other across the floor of the House.  The atmosphere is not right and there is no effort to put the atmosphere right with regard to this question of tariffs.  Neither the viewpoint of the manufacturers nor the viewpoint of those engaged in the industry is right.  We have a scream   coming from Cork for general tariffs regardless of the fact of where they are to begin or where they are to end. 
     
     
      
       That is not so. 
     
     
      
       We find that the wages paid in Cork to assemblers&mdash;not fitters, but men who put little parts of machines together&mdash;amount to £5.  In Dublin the wages of the same employees amount to £3 7s. 6d., and on the other side of the Channel the wages amount to £2 17s. 6d.  The output on the other side is fully one hundred per cent. greater than the output in Dublin or Cork. 
     
     
      
       Where did the Deputy get his figures? 
     
     
      
       If any Deputy is prepared to contradict me, he is at absolute liberty to do so.  I am giving the figures paid in wages in Cork, Dublin and England. 
     
     
      
       I would like to know where the Deputy got his figures from. 
     
     
      
       Apparently Deputy Morrissey does not like these figures. 
     
     
      
       I do not like Deputy Gorey stating what is not true. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Gorey is telling the absolute truth. 
     
     
      
       I do not know if it is against the rules for the Ceann Comhairle to express agreement with a Deputy.  Deputy Gorey began his speech by saying that he did not like the atmosphere in which this matter is being discussed.  I would like to express the most complete agreement with Deputy Gorey in that respect, and I would suggest to him that the atmosphere is not being improved; in fact, it is becoming more rarified and more difficult to get along in.  This is a Money Resolution to pay the expenses of a Tariff Commission which will inquire into tariffs.  I am quite prepared to agree, and have in fact agreed, that the discussion can be pretty wide, because very big issues are involved.  A Money Resolution can hardly be deemed to carry the discussion so far as this whole question   of relative rates of wages and so on. We have already had a fair discussion in regard to the position of farmers. We had Deputy Sears on one side and Deputy Baxter on the other side.  I was hoping that the question in regard to farmers was more or less settled on both sides.  Just think of the immense and acrimonious extent of the wages question. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Gorey has nothing else to talk about. 
     
     
      
       My object was to improve the position, and the way to improve it is to recognise where the faults are and try to meet them.  If Deputies want to hide the facts and to hide where faults are, and will make no effort to remedy what needs to be remedied, then the last position is worse than the first. 
       What I have in mind is a machine that was on exhibit at the Dublin Show.  It was a thistle-cutter, and the price asked for it was £26.  It was a simple little machine that could easily be sold for ten guineas.  If it was produced outside Ireland I am sure it would be sold for at least twelve guineas.  That gives us a clear-cut idea that things are not right.  It shows us that the protection which this Commission is to be set up in connection with is not protection for efficiency or to give a fair chance to Irish industries, but really means protection for inefficiency.  There were no sales of that thistle-cutter for which £26 were asked.  If the machine could be sold for twelve or fifteen guineas, I am sure forty or fifty machines could be disposed of at the show.  I have all this from the agents.  The explanation of the maker of this machine, produced at Cork, is that the price is high because of the cost of wages and the output.  There was another machine also from Cork, a single-drill scarifier. I wonder does Deputy Morrissey know what that means? 
     
     
      
       Of course, Deputy Gorey has all the intelligence. He knows nothing at all about the Bill and therefore he must abuse everybody. 
     
     
     
      
       That sort of talk is cheap. 
     
     
      
       That is the way to improve the atmosphere. 
     
     
      
       Who is the maker of that machine? 
     
     
      
       For a single-drill scarifier made or assembled in Cork we are asked £4 5s.  That article was put on the market a few years ago at £1 15s. It was put on the market by an Irish inventor and he could not sell it.  After going through the hands of the Cork assemblers the price is now put at £4 5s., though when it was offered at £1 15s. there was no sale.  And there is no sale now for it, because of the price at which it is put on the market. That is the position that farmers are faced with at present, and that is the position that they are asked to bolster up.  This is the position that they are asked to sustain.  And now we are told &ldquo;wages must be arranged regardless of output,&rdquo; and that wages must be guaranteed under this Bill or that it is no good.  I say that such a state of things gives us no confidence whatsoever in the future.  Every step will be viewed by us with suspicion, and not alone with suspicion, but with a conviction that we are not going to get value for our money, and that we are going to be fleeced.  If we could see a real effort made to meet the position with regard to the acceptance of a fair wage or a wage that the industry could pay, and that there would be a fair output, we would have very little to say on this question and very little qualms about putting our hands in our pockets although they are already depleted to the last copper in trying to put this industrial position right. 
       But step after step and evidence after evidence is convincing us that there is nothing like that going to ensue.  We feel suspicion and distrust and we are absolutely certain that the result is only going to be that the very class of man who cannot defend himself in this country is going to be fleeced.  I have been asked by the Deputy from Cork to name the Cork manufacturer of the thistle-cutter and I do now name him.  It is MacBride. 
     
     
     
      
       How does the price compare with the cross-Channel price for the same article? 
     
     
      
       There is no other thistle-cutter of this description that I am aware of.  This is a circular disc-knife, and it is a real good little machine. 
     
     
      
       Nothing else could come from Cork. 
     
     
      
       I have one of these myself.  I got it years ago.  If it could be sold at a reasonable price there would be no difficulty in getting a sale for it.  There would be plenty of sale for it.  It is a simple machine. 
     
     
      
       You have no idea of the price of the cross-Channel machine of the same kind? 
     
     
      
       It is about £10 10s. 
     
     
      
       What is the price of the cross-Channel scarifier? 
     
     
      
       You would get a double scarifier that would take two drills for less than the price of the Cork one.  That, sir, is the feeling we have on this question.  The same might be said about the Ford motorcars. The price outside the Saorstat is £125.  The price of the Cork manufactured Ford is £150.  What is the explanation? Is it because this is protected in Ireland?  Is that why the Irish people must pay out of their pockets £25 in excess of the price anywhere else?  What is the explanation? Is it that wages in Cork are higher? Or is it they will not work in Cork and give a fair output?  Or is it that the manufacturer, because these are manufactured in Ireland, will demand £25 more on each motor car than he is prepared to sell it outside? 
     
     
      
       That is the scarifier now. 
     
     
      
       Well, it is alleged to be a motor-car and many people consider it is a motor-car.  I think it would be well to accept it as something with some real sense and some real truth in it that the Irish farmer is not as big a fool as even Deputy Johnson or Deputy Morrissey would take him   to be.  Those who make those charges against him should not take him for being as big a fool as they think. 
     
     
      
       I never suggested that the farmer was a fool. 
     
     
      
       There are other alternatives. 
     
     
      
       Another question has been asked, whether by fostering these industries we absorb 80,000 unemployed or whether we are to meet that problem otherwise.  Now, I hold that it is a very small percentage of that 80,000 unemployed that is going to be absorbed.  And not alone will we be carrying this weight of 80,000 unemployed, but we will be carrying the new weight as well.  Would any sensible man say, whatever the number of unemployed is in Ireland, whether it is 80,000 or more or less, that 10,000 of those are going to be employed even if we adopt a general tariff?  Does anybody make that assertion?  Can anybody prove it?  I say the position will be that we will be supporting these 70,000 or 80,000 unemployed even if we adopt tariffs, except we find other means of employment for them.  At the same time we will be subsidising all the industries that want protection.  That is to say, the people of Ireland will be carrying two loads instead of one.  It is altogether misleading to say that you are going to get rid of one by taking on the other.  The real truth is that you are adding on a new one to the load you are already carrying.  That is the reason why we are taking the stand we have taken on this particular question. 
     
     
      
       took the Chair. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Johnson said that the form of the Bill, and certain words in the resolution indicated that this was being approached as a revenue problem, and the Bill was given something of the character of a revenue Bill. That is a misunderstanding.  There are three Departments which would be concerned with any proposals about tariffs. The Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Department of Lands and   Agriculture, are the three Departments I refer to.  These would be the three Departments which would be primarily concerned.  The action to be taken as a result of any report would be the actual action that would be taken by the Department of Finance.  The Department of Industry and Commerce might be said to lean, and would, ordinarily, lean perhaps in favour of getting people employed by the imposition of tariffs.  The Department of Agriculture would perhaps lean somewhat in the other direction, and it has been thought desirable that so far as there is departmental and ministerial responsibility for the Commission, that that should be exercised through the Minister for Finance.  I do not think that there is a great deal of substance in the arguments put forward by Deputy Johnson, that this problem is being approached in the wrong way, or that in practice we will have less or more of the pulling and dragging to which he refers under the system that we are proposing than under the sort of Commission that he would suggest. 
     
     It is a fact that most industries in the Saorstat, leaving out altogether the big industries like brewing and one or two others, are applying for protection. They are actually approaching the Minister and they have been urging their case with persistence.  In certain cases they argue that their circumstances are such that the question is a question of urgency.  It was primarily to deal with the situation produced by the applications of manufacturers and by their arguments that the existing industries cannot wait a great length of time for consideration that this Bill has been introduced, and that it is proposed that this Commission be set up.  You will not alter the fundamental facts of the situation by giving wider powers to the Commission. You will not, anyhow, remove any element of pulling and dragging that may exist by saying that the Government shall examine applications and refer them to the Commission later.  As a matter of fact.  I think that on the whole we will have a much better and a much fairer system of examination by having people, who   think that protection is necessary for the mere preservation of their industries or for the preservation and expansion of their industries, come before the Commission of Inquiry and prove their cases.  You will not then have the energies directed to putting pressure other than, shall we say, the pressure of argument upon Ministers. I certainly think that what we propose is, on the whole, a much more satisfactory arrangement than that proposed by Deputy Johnson.  In so far as there may be nobody interested enough to apply for protection, the case is one that should be dealt with otherwise. I have already instanced the case of sugar beet.  If anything like that were to appear to Ministers to require examination and with regard to which action would seem desirable, our view is that we should have that specially investigated, but the body that would investigate that need not be, and probably should not be, the body which is investigating the ordinary run of proposals. Because the ordinary run of proposals refers to industries already in existence and about which certain definite facts can be obtained, the work is entirely different from the work necessary where you have not an industry in existence, where you have to act very much more on faith, where the matter is really a matter of policy and of experiment, and where the details of cost cannot be weighed and, largely owing to the definitely experimental nature of the work, do not count a great deal. 
     I do not think, however, that one can say that even the application of a manufacturer is purely an application based on personal interests. In many cases it will be based on personal interest.  But there are manufacturers and people who have gone into the business of manufacturing and who are prepared to go into the business of manufacturing, who will look at the problems of tariffs from more than a purely personal interest.  We have all of us known such people.  They are unfortunately not very many&mdash;we have all known people who have definitely gone into industry not because they were going to make any more profit by putting their money into Irish industries   than by investing it outside Ireland but because they thought that the country needed this expansion, and because they thought that it was up to them to do something towards producing that expansion.  You will also find that many manufacturers have other interests in the country, and that there will even in applications put forward by groups of manufacturers be a very definite element of consideration of national interests.  In any case many sorts of tribunals might be established and they might have a great variety of functions.  We have particular work that we think it necessary to have done.  We are concerned to put up what we have put up as the best machinery to do that work. If, later on, it is felt that it has become urgent to discharge other functions, we will consider whether we will extend the powers of this Commission, or set up another Commission.  We have given this matter a good deal of consideration. It had been given some consideration even before the question of setting up the tribunal was considered. It had been given consideration even before the Budget statement was made in 1925.  On the 24th April, 1925, I said in the   Dail: &ldquo;I am not saying that, in the course of a year or so, we ought not to have some sort of formal tribunal examining matters and having cases made and opposed before it.&rdquo;  As long ago as the 24th April, 1925, I indicated we had given attention to the desirability of having a tribunal where cases would be formally made and opposed by those who might be affected if the applications were granted. 
     A good deal of the discussion to-day has been repetition of discussion that took place on the Bill, and to my mind it only emphasises the need for restricting the scope of this Commission if we are to get good results from it.  If we are to widen its scope so that it is to deal with general principles, then it might be operating for a considerable time without getting us much further.  The question of having a protective policy or a rigidly free trade policy is not one that could be decided by any tribunal or in regard to which the investigations or findings of any tribunal could carry us very much further.  Those are matters for which politicians must take political responsibility.

       That a Supplementary Sum, not exceeding £5,000, be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for payments under the Railways Act, 1924, the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, etc., and for other purposes connected with Irish Transport. 
     
     The Burtonport, Carndonagh and Letterkenny extensions of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway were constructed with the aid of State funds.  They are worked by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company under a statutory agreement which provides that the working Company shall be allowed out of the receipts the actual cost of working up to a maximum sum calculated at the rate of £3 10s. per mile per week, the receipts above the cost of working and interest on Guaranteed Stock which amounts to £400 per annum to be divided evenly between the working Company and the Treasury, now the Department of Finance, or with the consent of the Department applied to improvements on the line.  The cost of working has for some considerable time been far in excess of the figure of £3 10s. per mile per week allowed.  The   deficiencies for the years 1923, 1924 and 1925 were for 1923, £16,133; for 1924, £9,957; and for 1925 £11,211. These deficiencies were met by a payment out of the Compensation Fund of the British Government and by an advance of £1,510 from the Saorstat Government in 1923-4 in respect of the loss in 1923.  The Saorstat Government made an advance of £5,430 in 1924-25 in respect of the loss in 1924.  Last year the Government of the Saorstat and the Government of Northern Ireland made advances of £7,000 each in respect of the loss in 1925. 
     The Company's accounts have recently been examined by officers of the Transport and Marine Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce who recommended the continuance of the allowance.  It is proposed, as seen on the face of the Estimate, that a grant of £5,000 should be made this year.  The Government of Northern Ireland has also agreed to make a grant of £5,000.  This grant must really be regarded as a temporary expedient for carrying on the lines.  Arrangements for the future working of them are under consideration, but any change that would be involved would necessitate legislation.  The lines can only keep working by providing the money which will enable the Company to carry on. 
     
      
       In relation to this supplementary estimate I wish to say a word or two.  Here we are asked for a subsidy.  No doubt it is possibly the alternative to a restricted service or perhaps to a closing down, but why are we in this position with respect to this railway?  I will say here that we are so circumstanced through apathy, delay, and neglect on the part of the Government to put the railways in our county on an economic basis.  We have two separate railway companies, each with about 100 miles of railway, in our county.  Each of these lines runs to and from what was our county port in the past, namely, Derry.  All traffic went from our county in that direction and our trading requirements came through from this port.  Since 1922 this port has been placed or retained in a different State with barbed wire barriers through which we have as yet   humiliatingly to crawl.  This intolerable position is the result of our own Government's procrastination or neglect, if you can call it so. 
       Our railways can be made economic at a comparatively small cost by linking them up and having amalgamation and connection with our own State and our own ports and interlinking to a very small extent.  No one can understand why this is not being done.  Instead we have to pay supplementary grants like this to maintain this intolerable position.  The main body of the members of the House, and I presume some members of the Executive Council, have no correct knowledge of the extraordinary position of our county, bounded as it is on one side by the Six Counties, with only an outlet towards our own State of about half a mile, and on the other side by the Atlantic Ocean with several superior but undeveloped ports.  With its own port barriered off and no railway connection with its own State, it is an object lesson of Government incapacity, if nothing worse, to find that as yet no steps have been taken economically to connect it with its own State, to interlink and amalgamate its two railways and to direct these lines to and from its own ports instead of keeping it in dependence on another State with all the consequent disadvantage to itself and advantage to an adjoining foreign area. 
       I must ask the Minister to give me some definite undertaking that we will not be asked for any more subsidies on this head, but that the interlinking and connection of our county with its own State and its own port will be taken up by the Government without any more delay and that our county will be placed in the same position in relation to its own State as the other counties of the State are at present.  If that is done we will have no need for these subsidies; the thing can be made economic. Our two lines of railways can be interlinked by a very small connection and amalgamated.  As a consequence you will do away with the necessity for coming to this House and asking for £5,000 to pay to a company which is in the position this company is in at present, because of the fact that these things are not done. 
     
     It is the first duty of the Government   to see that all its areas are brought into common relationship, and that any particular county is not hidden away behind a barrier and left to fend for itself without any connection whatever with its own State, and to see that it is not compelled to go, at whatever cost, through barriers that are erected by other people to discriminate between the people of this State and others.  It is the duty of our paternal Government to see that that county is placed in the same position of independence as every other county in the State.  If that is done we will have no need for these doles and subsidies that are being given by this Government and the Northern Government, which has only a few miles of these railways within its area. Undoubtedly the fact that the Northern Government is giving the same amount as we are shows the extent to which they are dependent on our side of the border.  They are hardheaded men and they are not likely to give anything away if it is not of any advantage for their own purposes.  They would be very slow to pass it otherwise. 
     Vote put and agreed to. 
   
   
     IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - VOTE 63&mdash;ARMY. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Go ndeontar suim breise, na raghaidh thar £8,305, chun ioctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith inioctha i rith na bliana dar crioch an 31adh la de Mharta, 1927, chun Costas an Airm, maraon le Cul-tace an Airm. 
       That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £8,305, be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for the cost of the Army, including Army Reserve. 
       This deals with certain transactions which were the subject of discussion in the Dail about a year ago, and following the disallowance of the sum which has been paid out of the Army Vote it is necessary that if the Accounting Officer is relieved of responsibility the sum should be made good.  I really have nothing that I would wish to add to what I said when this subject was previously under discussion in the Dail. 
     
     
     
      
       I do not want to enter into any long discussion on this matter or to raise questions that need not be raised, but I feel it is not quite satisfactory to allow a matter of this importance to pass without some comment. The question has been discussed, of course, as the Minister has pointed out, by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I happen to have been chairman of that Committee, and that in a way relieves me of any liability for raising the matter as a member of the Dail.  That is to say, pretty well all that I have to say on the matter has been stated in the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think, therefore, that I cannot be charged with any failure to act up to my responsibilities, if I do not enter into any long examination of the question.  But it is necessary, I think, to say that this Vote should be agreed to because of the fact that if it were not so agreed to liability would fall upon the Accounting Officer for the Department, while as a matter of equity such officer would not and should not be deemed to be responsible for this payment.  Technically he is responsible.  The circumstances were such that he should be rightly relieved of liability by the Dail, and it is on that account that I support the proposition, but I think it would be wrong for me not to say that the payments were wrongly made and that they were made by the Accounting Officer by direction.  The Committee was of opinion that there was not a real liability for the payment, and the payments were not justifiable.  The Committee invited the Minister to come to the Dail for this Vote and to justify it to the Dail.  He has not done that except by referring to a speech he made a year ago.  That speech was not very satisfying, and therefore the speech here is even less satisfying.  If I had been asked to put forward a case in favour of this Vote I would have said that it was probably as a matter of public policy that these payments were made, and in the circumstances as a matter of public policy we might accept that view of the matter.  That case has not been made and I regret it.  But it is because of my feeling   that the liability for this payment would otherwise fall on the Accounting Officer that I am prepared to state that the Vote should be passed.  It is because I have said all that needs to be said from my point of view on the matter in the Report to the Dail that I feel myself relieved of responsibility for pursuing the matter further. 
     
     
      
       I certainly thought that I made the case last year that the payments were made on account of public policy.  That was my recollection. If I did not make that case, I certainly do make it now.  I do not want to go further into the details.

     IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - TARIFF COMMISSION BILL, 1926&mdash;THIRD STAGE. 
     (1)  As soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act the Minister for Finance shall establish a Commission (in this Act referred to as &ldquo;the Commission&rdquo;) which shall be styled &ldquo;the Tariff Commission&rdquo; and shall consist of three members of whom one, who shall be chairman, shall be nominated by the Minister for Finance, one shall be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and one shall be nominated by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture. 
     (2)  Nominations of members of the Tariff Commission shall be made from time to time as occasion requires, and every member shall, unless he previously dies or resigns, retain his membership for two years from the date of his nomination but shall be eligible for renomination. 
     
      
       I move: 
     
     In sub-section (1), line 17, to delete the words &ldquo;Minister for   Finance&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Executive Council.&rdquo; 
     The object of this amendment is to make the responsibility for establishing the Commission one for the Executive Council, and while I recognise quite clearly that the act of the Minister for Finance is the act of the Executive Council it makes a difference, I think, in our approach to this matter whether the Commission that is to be set up is to be appointed as a Departmental Commission or as the act of the Executive Council as a council.  I think that the status of the Commission will in that way be somewhat raised.  It will not then seem to be a matter purely of revenue, but it will pre-suppose that the Executive Council as a body is looking upon this matter with some consideration for the general interests and not merely the financial interests. 
     
      
       I think Deputy Johnson's point, so far as there is substance in it, is met by the fact that it is proposed that members should be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  I do not think it is desirable that there should be an unnecessary loading of the burden of formal acts that must be done by the Executive Council.  If you pursue the policy of making all sorts of things formal acts of the Executive Council you may take up the time of the Council with formal acts to the diminution of the time that is available for the acts that are non-formal, and require real discussion and consideration.  In a matter like this, where any difficulty arises or where it is likely to be controversial, the Minister for Finance, who must be a member of the Executive Council, will naturally consult with his colleagues, but he will not be obliged, where there is agreement, to delay formal acceptance and to wait for formal orders.  I think it is preferable, where the machinery is available for appointing a body by a Minister, that it should be done by the Minister. 
     
     
      
       I think the Minister's objections are very thin indeed. Mainly they seem to be that there might be some delay in waiting for the Council to meet and to make the appointment   even though they had been nominated already by three Ministers. This is not going to be a weekly act. I hope there are not going to be frequent changes of Commissioners.  If delay is the only objection, and it seems to be the only objection, surely a delay of one day after so long a delay is not going to cause much trouble.  In reference to the general scope of the operations of the Department of Finance I want to point out that the setting up of the Commission by the Minister for Finance does not seem to fit in with the work of the Minister for Finance provided that this is not merely a revenue collection or an imposition business.  The Ministers and Secretaries Act defines the work of the Department of Finance as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;The Department of Finance, which shall comprise the administration and business generally of the public finance of Saorstat Eireann and all powers, duties and functions connected with the same, including in particular the collection and expenditure of the revenues of Saorstat Eireann from whatever source arising (save as may be otherwise provided by law), and the supervision and control of all purchases made for or on behalf of and all supplies of commodities and goods held by any Department of State and the functions of the branches and officers....&rdquo; 
     
     There is nothing in that that would suggest to me at any rate that the setting up of a Commission to have in mind the improvement, if possible, of industry should be the creation of the Department of Finance.  It has not primarily to do with the imposition or the collection of taxes.  It has primarily to do with the examination of claims for improvement of industry and commerce in the country.  Why in those circumstances the Minister for Finance should be brought in as the authority that should establish the Commission passes my understanding. I could have understood very much more clearly if the Commission was to be set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that there would be an objection to altering it to the Executive Council.  But my desire in making   the Executive Council responsible for setting up the Commission is that from the beginning it has been looked upon as an important body with a status rather higher than it would be if merely set up by a Departmental Ministry. To make it a creation of the Executive Council does, I suggest, in the first instance, indicate that it is a Commission with more than a Departmental Minister's authority. 
     
      
       The position in the past in regard to tariffs has been that as a rule the consideration has been referred by the Executive Council to a sub-committee of the Cabinet consisting of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Agriculture.  It is recognised that those are the three Ministers whose Departments are qualified best to investigate these problems and whose ordinary work is   affected by any decisions in regard to these problems.  The reason why the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not the Minister mentioned in the section rather than the Minister for Finance is simply, as I have already indicated, that there may be proposals even for agricultural protection or there may be proposals for protection that would be held to affect very considerably, either adversely or otherwise, the industry of agriculture, and after consideration it was felt that the chairmanship and any Ministerial responsibility for the Commission or its working should not rest, so far as there would be such responsibility, on either the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, but rather should rest with the Minister for Finance, who departmentally would be a neutral person in the matter.

       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (1), line 19, after the words &ldquo;shall consist of&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;not less than.&rdquo; 
     
     This amendment is to make it possible to add to the number comprising the Commission.  The proposal in the Bill is to establish a Commission consisting of three persons.  I can conceive of the Commission wishing to   inquire into special aspects of one or other problems.  It may be found desirable that the Commission should divide itself into a number of sub-committees for a preliminary inquiry. It would, therefore, be desirable to have a larger number.  The original intention was to form a Commission consisting of three members, that these three members were to be civil servants, and that it was not to be a whole-time position for these civil servants. It might well be thought desirable to bring in as aid persons from outside who are not of the civil service and who could devote their whole time to the work.  It was to make it possible for the Commission to be enlarged that I have sought to insert these words: &ldquo;not less than three,&rdquo; leaving it within the option of the Minister to enlarge it as he thinks well. 
     
      
       I do not know that it will be necessary to have the Commission sub-divide itself into committees. The Commission will be provided with a permanent staff.  While the members of the Commission would not be whole-time in their work, the secretary and other officers would be whole-time, and a great deal of what might be called the preliminary investigation, the spade-work, the examination of accounts and talking out of information from accounts, would, I presume, be done by the staff.  The Commission itself would not be selected as, say, expert accountants.  They would not be expected to do the preliminary work.  They would direct somebody to do it, and supervise and check the doing of it by somebody.  I do not think that it need be contemplated that it will be necessary for the Commission to divide itself up into sub-committees for preliminary work. There would be a staff available for the doing of the preliminary work, and the Commission, when it has got all this preliminary work done, when it has heard all the evidence that was necessary to check or supplement these things, would formulate its report. The idea of sub-committees.  I think, postulates the members of the Commission themselves doing the actual spade-work, which I do not   think it would be necessary or desirable that a Commission should do. Some of that preliminary work would be such as, perhaps, would not require people of the type that would be required for the Commission itself. 
       I do not think a Commission could carry on with four members.  If you have more than three, I think you must have five, so that there can be a majority decision.  Even in matters of procedure it is necessary for smooth working that you should have an odd numbers, so that a majority decision can always be taken.  If you increase the membership of the Commission, you increase the cost, because, of course, whether you are paying special salaries or simply taking civil servants off other work, you are increasing the expense considerably&mdash;you are increasing the cost unnecessarily.  If we were actually asking the Commission to decide whether there should or should not be a tariff, there might be good grounds for having a big Board, but where their business is to ascertain facts, I do not think it is necessary to run up the cost in this way.  There might be a danger, too, if you make the board big, that you will have a fluctuating board and will have evidence viewed and weighed differently at different times and in connection with different applications.  If you had five or seven members&mdash;say even five&mdash;you might possibly have the board carrying on without its full membership being present, and because you would have different men present you might have different weight given to the same sort of evidence given at different times.  There would be certain disadvantages arising from that. So that, in general, for the work that is to be done, by getting men of different temperaments and different outlook and different experience, able to see that there are different angles to problems, you can get variety and strength enough for the Commission by having three members.  In our Supreme Court here we have only three judges.  There are people who say that there ought to be more, and that the Supreme Court should consist of five judges, at least.  In any case, we decided to carry on with three. 
     
     
     
      
       This explanation has thrown a little light on the intention of the Minister.  I hope that Deputy O'Shaughnessy, for instance, will appreciate the statement of the Minister. The work of this Commission&mdash;all the inquiry, all the examination&mdash;is to be done by the staff.  The tribunal&mdash; the three judges&mdash;are to sit and hear the evidence for and against presented, presumably, by the staff on the one hand and applicants on the other. Deputy Egan yesterday, and the Minister this morning, predicted that there would be a very large number of applications, and these applications may take different forms.  There may be applications for the imposition of a duty, the modification of a duty, or the renewal of a duty.  One firm, or one group of firms in the same business, might apply for an increase, and another group in the same business might apply for a modification in another direction or a retention, and other business may be applying at the same time.  Presumably there is going to be a considerable variety of applications, if the prophecy of a large number is to come true.  They will not be all in one direction.  The test that is to be applied in all these cases is set out in the schedule.  Somebody has to inquire into the likely effects on prices, the likely effects upon other industries. These, by the way, are not examinations into facts, but into expectations or probabilities. 
     
     If the work of inquiry in all these separate directions, into this multiplicity of industries, in respect to a large number of articles, is to be left to the staff, and then all to be brought together before the Commission, which is to be a part-time operation, and the three persons, each with a different point of view, balancing one against the other, are to come together for a final vetting, we know how long it is going to take to get through this multiplicity of inquiries.  I would have thought that it was inevitable&mdash;almost a certainty&mdash;that much of the work of inquiry in respect to particular applications, particular items in this schedule, would have been relegated to one or more members of the Commission&mdash;two members, let us say, looking after the effects on other industries, two other   members looking after the effects upon the particular industry, and some other &mdash;if there were a larger number&mdash;looking after the cost, efficiency and conditions of labour, and the cost, efficiency and conditions of the industry itself.  All these various aspects cannot be left to the departmental staff to do all the preliminary work, leaving the members of the tribunal to carry on their own departmental work and to be brought together when the work has been done by the staff, merely to draw up a report. 
     That, apparently, is the prospect before the Deputies and before the people interested in those applications.  I think that there is quite a good case to be made in favour of adding, let us say, a representative of consumers as such, a representative of manufacturers as such, or a representative of labour as such, to the Commission.  Supposing only one outsider, one non-civil servant is appointed, if you want to bring into the Commission some detached view or specialised view, I think it is desirable that there should be at least the power to increase the number.  But, of course, the Minister's vision of the way this Commission is going to work naturally alters the position.  If it is only to be a body coming together to gather into a focus all the work that has been done by the staff&mdash;the inquiry into the operations of the particular firm or group of firms, the capital invested, the number of persons employed, the total annual value of goods produced, and under schedule 2, the cost, efficiency and conditions of labour in Saorstat Eireann compared with such cost, efficiency and conditions in other countries&mdash;unless the Minister is going to rely entirely upon the figures submitted by the International Labour Office, that might well require careful examination, apart from what the Commissioners themselves would carry on.  I think that some member of the Commission might well be relegated to supervise that particular inquiry.  If the real work of the Commission is to be done by the staff, then I am reinforced in my view that there is no necessity for this Commission at all&mdash;that is to say&mdash;that the Departments as they are now constituted, can do the work very efficiently.  I wonder, therefore, whether   Deputies are still satisfied, after the Minister's explanation, that this Commission is going to do any good work. 
     
      
       Deputy Johnson has put down this amendment and a great many others on the lines of building on the structure of this Bill a very much larger and wider organisation than the Bill contemplates.  I am not enthusiastic about the Bill, but I am certainly less enthusiastic about building up an organisation which is going to settle for us the question we were debating in the last couple of days, that is the question of tariff reform generally and the whole principle that discussion of that kind involves. I think the discussions in connection with the Bill have disclosed the fact that there is a great deal of difference of opinion, and that the principle of the tariff controversy is one which must be put to the people and ultimately settled by them.  The Commission, as I see it, is not one that is going to be overworked in the sense Deputy Johnson would have us believe.  Perhaps it was the statement of the Minister that led up to that. There are not so many industries in existence in the country that could, as industries, come before the Commission with a case for consideration. I think this Commission would not be competent, at least, I hope it would not be competent, to settle the general principle.  In my judgment at all events, the basis of the work of this Commission proposed to be set up is to deal with applications as emergency applications, in so far as the Government or the House may be agreeable to tide over a period for a particular industry in a difficult position at the moment, and which must be of a temporary character. 
     
     We have a great many Departments in this Free State of ours&mdash;too many, I think&mdash;and the whole basis of Deputy Johnson's amendments is on the lines of encouraging the Ministry to set up another huge Department on this question which neither this nor any other Commission can settle without the consent of the people as a whole.  I am absolutely opposed to any such reading into the Bill as that.  Deputy Johnson   says the Bill is no use.  I do not think, except as a temporary measure, I would accept the Bill as being of any use. 
     
      
       I wonder whether Deputies realise what the Bill involves? Deputy Hewat suggests that there is not going to be any, or, at all events, only very few applications. That, of course, I do not know.  Ministers speaking with knowledge of the situation and the number of applications that have already been submitted and refused, told us that they expect there will be a considerable number of applications and, therefore, a considerable amount of inquiry necessary. 
     
     
      
       They were refused without much consideration. 
     
     
      
       They may have been refused without much consideration. I do not know.  But there will be at least, or it is expected there will be, a sufficient number of applications to warrant the Ministry in going to the trouble of bringing in this Bill and setting up a Commission and getting a Financial Resolution passed. 
       Now, inasmuch as Deputy Hewat and the majority of the Dail have confirmed the views of the Ministers in that respect, we have to assume, for the purposes of this discussion, that there are going to be a considerable number of applications, and one of the possible lines of application would be the imposition, modification or renewal of a customs duty.  It is possible that a firm engaged in any industry will apply for the modification of a duty. I am assuming that that may mean an application for the increase of a duty.  There is a general duty upon wearing apparel, and wearing apparel may consist of a very considerable number of articles which are produced in this country.  They may be produced in small quantities, and a firm, let us say, dealing in outer garments made of wool or that inner garments made of cotton or linen or wool&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       What about corsets? 
     
     
      
       That is exactly a case in point.  It may be found that   fifteen per cent. on one of those many articles is not sufficient, and that it would require a higher duty, but that fifteen per cent. in another case is ample.  Applications will be in respect of a duty on a particular item&mdash;the modification or alteration in the duty upon a particular item, for instance, such as feathers, haberdashery and handkerchiefs.  How is that inquiry to be conducted?  Supposing a dozen or fifteen or twenty different applications of that kind come in at the same time, how are they to be conducted? 
     
     
      
       Turned down, I think, in most cases. 
     
     
      
       Are they to be conducted by the staff alone?  Deputy Hewat thinks that this Bill will involve the creation of a new staff Of course it will involve the creation of a staff if business under it is to be conducted properly.  Does Deputy Hewat think that in voting for this Bill it is intended that all the work would be done by the three Commissioners?  I venture to say if he thought that he had not much regard to the peace of mind or the possibility of rest of the three Commissioners, because I assume he believed the Minister when he said that there would be a large number of applications under this Bill. 
     
     
      
       They are only taking the place of the Minister for Finance so far as I know. 
     
     
      
       Yes.  But the Deputy said that there was need for this   Commission&mdash;that is to say, there must be a separate authority or tribunal which must be served by a staff.  As the Minister said it will inquire into and do all the preliminary work and inquire into applications having regard to the various aspects as outlined in this schedule.  I say the Deputy's objection does not assist the Minister, because the Minister has already laid it down that there must be a staff, and the staff is going to do the greater part of the work.  I think it may be necessary to add to the number of Commissioners so that a particular department of inquiry may have the supervision of one or other of the Commissioners.  In that way the Commissioners will be really the people to carry on the examination, not merely a tribunal to come in and collect together all the material which has been decided upon, in fact selected and approved of by the staff, that the Commissioners will, in fact, be the men carrying out the work of the inquiry.  It really comes to the question whether that is the intention or whether they are to have a final say in the matter of finishing off and signing the report that will then be presented to the Minister.  If the Commission is to do the actual work I think there should be an opportunity given to bring in, if necessary, additional Commissioners, who would probably be selected for the special parts of the inquiry.

     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - CONGESTION IN CO. MAYO. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he is aware that acute congestion exists in the townlands of Derrynagower, Derrowel, Facefield Acres, and Coolaghbawn, on the De Clifford and Lynch Blosse Estates, Co. Mayo, which were taken over by the Congested Districts Board in 1912, and if he will state when the large grazing ranches on those estates will be divided amongst the uneconomic tenants in the foregoing townlands. 
     
     
      
       The notice given of this question was not sufficient to enable me to get the information desired. I shall be gald, therefore, if the Deputy will repeat this question next week. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state what steps, if any, are being taken by the Land Commission to acquire the large grazing ranch held by Mr. Martin Curran at Ballykinave, Claremorris, Co. Mayo, for the purpose of relieving acute congestion in the townlands of Meelickmore, Meelickbeg, Tootagh, and Ballykinave, where over 40 tenants hold uneconomic holdings under £5 valuation. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission are having inquiries made as to lands in the occupation of Martin and James Curran, of Carrowhawney, Ballykinave. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if   he will state what steps, if any, are being taken by the Irish Land Commission to take over the grazing ranches held by Messrs. Brown and Cassidy, Poolavaddy, Balla, Co. Mayo, on the Lynch Blosse Estate (Major O'Connor's lease) for the relief of congestion. 
     
     
      
       The notice given of this question was not sufficient to enable me to get the necessary information. I shall be glad, therefore, if the Deputy will repeat the question next week. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he is aware that acute congestion exists in the parish of Castlebar, Co. Mayo, and if he will state when the Land Commission will divide the Brown estate, Breaghwy, among the small farmers of that district, whose valuations are from £2 to £5. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission have recently issued an offer for the purchase of the untenanted lands on the estate of Major D.S. Browne and await the owner's reply.
