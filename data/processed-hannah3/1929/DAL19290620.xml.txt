     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Coast Erosion in Wicklow. 
     
      
       asked the President whether the Executive Council have given consideration to the question of coast erosion, with particular reference to the recent inroads of the sea on the Wicklow Coast, and, if so, if he will state what steps it is proposed to take to deal with the matter. 
     
     
      
       The question of coast erosion generally will be the subject of examination by an Interdepartmental Committee. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Overholding of Betting Duty. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) against how many bookmakers have body warrants been issued arising out of overholding of Betting Duty; (b) the amount of duty due the Revenue Commissioners in each case; and (c) the amount of the fine imposed in each case. 
     
     
      
       I must ask the Deputy to be good enough to repeat his question in a week's time. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Detention of Bookmakers. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) how many bookmakers are at present detained in the Saorstat prisons arising out of overholding of Betting Duty; (b) the amount of duty due the Revenue Commissioners in each case; (c) the amount of the fine imposed   in each case; and (d) the duration of confinement in each case to date. 
     
     
      
       The particulars required by the Deputy, set out according to the headings in the question, are as follows:&mdash; 
       (a)  Two. 
       (b)  £282 8s. 8d. and £27 8s. 1d. 
       (c)  £500 and £500 (mitigated by the District Justice to £125). 
       (d)  51 days and 36 days. 
       The first items and the second items under the headings (b) (c) and (d) correspond. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Transfer of Public Works Functions. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether any functions of the Commissioners of Public Works have been transferred to the Electricity Supply Board under Section 105 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, and, if so, what functions have been so transferred; and further, if a transfer of functions has been made, whether he will state why the resolution required under sub-section (8) of the above section has not been tabled for approval. 
     
     
      
       No functions of the Commissioners of Public Works have been transferred to the Electricity Supply Board.

     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Concerts for Local Improvements. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that concerts are sometimes held to raise funds to enable groups in villages to undertake local improvements, and whether such concerts will be classed as concerts of a philanthropic nature for the purposes of exemption from entertainments tax. 
     
     
      
       I am aware that entertainments are sometimes held for the purpose indicated and that exemption from payment of entertainments duty has not been allowed, as the Revenue Commissioners were not satisfied that the statutory conditions therefor were fulfilled. 
       I am unable to give any undertaking in the direction suggested by the Deputy in the second part of his question.  Each case falls to be considered on its merits. 
     
     
      
       I have a case in point here where the Tourist Development Committee in my constituency got up a concert for the purpose of getting some funds to enable them to develop the district, and they were charged £5 16s. 8d. duty on the concert.  I consider that that is an injustice. 
     
     
      
       The principle that governs the giving of relief is that the promoters must be disinterested. If a number of shopkeepers, say, in a village, promote some enterprise which is calculated to benefit themselves along with others, then that cannot be exempted from duty on the grounds of philanthropy. 
     
     
      
       I can assure the Minister that this committee is not composed of shopkeepers.  It was got up for the sole purpose of developing the district, where there is a large amount of unemployment.  Under these circumstances I think it is grossly unfair. 
     
     
      
       I do not know anything personally about the committee. I was only stating the principle on which the Revenue Commissioners would deal with it, and on which I am satisfied they did deal with it. 
     
     
     
      
       Will the Minister consider the question of introducing an amendment to the Finance Bill to remove this injustice? 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       Then I must raise it on the adjournment. 
     
     
      
       I think there is an amendment on the Paper dealing with the matter. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Income Tax on Teachers' Salaries. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he can state in what months income tax is usually deducted from National Teachers' salaries; why income tax was deducted both in January and in April, 1929, from the salary of Mr. T. Roche, principal teacher of Ballylinan N.S., Co. Laoighse; whether teachers are informed of the allowances to which they are entitled, and, if not, whether the Minister is prepared to issue instructions to have due notification of such allowances and deductions given in future.

     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Thurles Compensation Award. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Mrs. McCarthy, Finna Road, Thurles, was   awarded only £100 compensation for the death of her son, who was shot by R.I.C. on March 27th, 1920; that on this occasion, also, an attempt was made to burn and blow up Mrs. McCarthy's house, which she, with her family, had to leave and seek lodgings, thereby incurring heavy expenses; that her youngest daughter died shortly afterwards from shock; and whether, having regard to these circumstances and to the inadequacy of the award, the matter will be reopened, with a view to increasing the amount granted. 
     
     
      
       I have nothing to add to the reply given by me on the 16th May, 1928, to a question by Deputy Timothy Sheehy (Tipperary) relative to the same case. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister think that justice has been done to this family after the hardship which they went through during the Black-and-Tan time by allowing them only £100, while other people in the same town got up to £800? 
     
     
      
       The matter was considered by the Personal Injuries Committee.  It was sent back by me to that Committee for reconsideration, and the Committee adhered to its recommendation.  With regard to the amount, I think the Deputy knows that that is really based on the question of dependency. Where there is dependency, the amount will be larger than where there is either no dependency or only partial dependency. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister refer to that same Committee those who are in receipt of army pensions and see how they will get on? 
     
     
      
       That is a matter for the Minister for Defence. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Motor Taxation. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether 30cwt. lorries on which at present an inclusive tax of £30 is paid will, if used occasionally as hackney vehicles, be subject to the new tax on 'buses. 
     
     
     
      
       Thirty-hundred weight lorries on which at present an inclusive tax of £30 is paid will, if used occasionally as hackney vehicles, be subject to the new tax on buses, if, as will presumably be the case, they have a seating capacity for more than six persons. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Post Office Motor Vans. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state the cost of repairs of all the motor vans plying to and from Mullingar Post Office from January 1st, 1929, to June 1st, 1929. 
     
     
      
       £126 3s. 6d. 
     
     
      
       Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that for the past six months they are breaking down constantly on the road and that as a result the postal deliveries are often an hour and two hours late? 
     
     
      
       That is a separate question. 
     
     
      
       Will the Parliamentary Secretary state if there has been any overtime claimed by postmen for the period I referred to? 
     
     
      
       That is a &ldquo;more separate&rdquo; question. 
     
     
      
       Will the Parliamentary Secretary state why a number of post vans sent by order of his Department from Messrs. Ford of Cork to Mullingar are lying there for the past three months while these old crocks are on the road all the time? 
     
     
      
       I have answered the Deputy's question.  All these are separate questions. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Garda Discipline in Sligo. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that Mr. Francis Burke, 38 George's Street. Sligo, was arrested by members of the Garda Siochana on June 8th and taken to Wine Street Police Station,   where, it is alleged, he was beaten by Gardai and accused of an offence of which he had been previously acquitted by a jury on the direction of the judge; if he will state the nature of the inquiry, if any, held into the conduct of the Gardai in the matter, and the disciplinary action taken against the Gardai responsible for the occurrence. 
     
     
      
       Francis Burke was arrested by members of the Garda Siochana at about 12.15 a.m. on the night of the 8th-9th instant, on a charge of being guilty of riotous and disorderly conduct.  He resisted arrest.  He was brought to the barrack and detained there for about half an hour when he was released on his giving an undertaking to go home quietly.  He was not assaulted, and no more force was employed in effecting his arrest than was necessary to overcome his resistance.  He was not accused of any offence of which he had previously been acquitted.  The charge against him will be dealt with at the Sligo District Court on the 21st instant.  No disciplinary enquiry into the conduct of the members of the Garda concerned is called for. 
     
     
      
       Of course this is only one of a series of cases mentioned here quite recently, and the Minister has given a typical reply.  I wish to ask the Minister would he not be prepared to accept evidence from me?  Would my word not be accepted if I am going to take the responsibility of making a statement that this boy was standing outside the Town Hall in Sligo, waiting the result of the election, when he was attacked by the Guards and taken to the barrack, and while in the barrack people in the town, who were standing outside the Town Hall, heard him distinctly roaring as he was being beaten by the Guards. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is making a statement and not asking a question. 
     
     
     
      
       I wish to give notice that I shall raise this matter on the adjournment. 
     
     
      
       This case is sub judice, and I think it is highly undesirable that it should be debated on the adjournment.  When the Deputy asks that his word should be accepted, I suggest to him that he can go down to Sligo and give evidence in the hearing of the case, where, on the 21st inst., his credibility will be a matter for the District Justice? 
     
     
      
       At whose expense will he go? 
     
     
      
       I presume at his own. 
     
     
      
       The Minister has stated that the case is sub judice.  Is the case of the Guards, of whom it is alleged that they acted in a manner prejudicial to good order and peace, sub judice? 
     
     
      
       There is no charge against the Guards. 
     
     
      
       I am making a charge against them in the question. 
     
     
      
       No charge has been made against them in Court. 
     
     
      
       I give notice that I shall raise this matter on the adjournment. 
     
     
      
       I should like to know whether it is in order for a Minister to refuse to accept the word of a Deputy when he personally pledges, in this House, his own credit and reputation to the statement he makes as an actual witness of this occurrence? 
     
     
      
       It would seem to me that the Minister is not obliged to accept the Deputy's word in the circumstances of this case. 
     
     
      
       The Minister prefers to accept the word of a Civic Guard rather than accept the word of an elected representative of the people. He will not order an inquiry into the conduct of the Guards. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Bogus Sweep Tickets. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the Saorstat is being exploited by foreign syndicates and individuals for the sale of bogus sweep tickets, and if he will state what steps are being taken to protect the public from being victimised. 
     
     
      
       My attention has been called to one such case in which tickets for sweepstakes on the Derby were issued from an address in London to persons resident in the Saorstat.  The police in London were immediately informed so that they might take suitable action. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - British and Foreign Sweepstakes. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the large sum of money annually leaving the Saorstat for investment in British and foreign sweepstakes, and whether he will consider the advisability of introducing proposals for legislation to permit of similar sweepstakes being organised in the Saorstat, in view of the benefits that would be derived by hospitals and other such deserving objects, in addition to providing employment. 
     
     
      
       I have no information as to the amount of money which leaves the Saorstat for investment in British and foreign sweepstakes.  The answer to the second part of the question is in the negative. 
     
     
      
       I beg to give notice that I shall raise the subject matter of these two questions on the motion for the adjournment either to-day or tomorrow. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Condition of Tipperary School. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware of the insanitary condition of Noan School, Killenaule, Co. Tipperary; if a report as to its condition has been made to him by an Inspector of his Department, and if the Minister will state what steps it is intended to take to put this school in a proper sanitary condition. 
     
     
     
      
       I have reports on the school by the Inspectors of my Department. The school building is in a reasonably good condition, requiring limewashing, internally and externally.  There are no out-offices and no playground. 
       The responsibility for keeping the school in good repair and in a sanitary condition rests with the Manager.  My Department is in communication with him on the subject. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Railway Facilities at Fairs. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that cattle buyers who attend at Campile fair, Co. Wexford, frequently find it impossible to have cattle sent by rail on day of fair to stations on the Great Southern Railways between Campile and Wexford, and if representations will be made to the railway company to have this matter rectified. 
     
     
      
       The Great Southern Railways Company inform me that they have received no complaints as to failure to forward cattle from Campile fair to stations between Campile and Wexford on the day of the fair.  A train leaving Waterford at 2.0 p.m. daily is available for any such traffic likely to offer in the ordinary course. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Acquisition of Electricity Supply Undertakings. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the controversies which have been made public between the owners of provincial electricity supply undertakings in the Saorstat and the Electricity Supply Board, and if he has any statement to make relative to this matter, and if he can furnish the names of all undertakings where terms of purchase have been satisfactorily arranged, and the relation between the capital subscribed and the compensation given in each case. 
     
     
     
      
       I have seen some discussion of these matters in the daily Press.  The terms for the acquisition of statutory undertakings are prescribed in the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  So far as non-statutory undertakings are concerned acquisition by the Electricity Supply Board can only take place on agreed terms, and I have no opinions to express as to what terms it would or would not be reasonable for either party to accept. 
       Inquiries on such matters as are referred to in the last part of the question should be directed to the Electricity Supply Board. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Shannon Power Scheme. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can state how many of the undertakings established by private capital have declined to accept the offers made in each case by the Electricity Supply Board to the undertakers, and in how many cases improved offers on the part of the Board have been made, and on what basis of compensation such increased offers were made. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can state what, if any, arrangements have been made with the larger firms in Limerick and elsewhere to avail of the power which will be available from the Electricity Supply Board for industrial purposes, and if he can furnish the names of the firms concerned. 
     
     
      
       I shall answer Questions 17 and 18 together.  Inquiries on such matters as are mentioned in the questions should be directed to the Electricity Supply Board. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Army Pensions. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence if he will state if Timothy Moriarty, Inchintray, Caherciveen, Co. Kerry, is the man described as Timothy Moriarty, Kerry, in the list of Army pensioners supplied by his Department; and, if so, what is the amount of pension he   is in receipt of, and what were the periods of service rendered by this man to entitle him to such pension. 
     
     
      
       The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. Mr. Moriarty is in receipt of a pension of £20 10s. 2d. per annum. The Board of Assessors constituted under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, reported to me that Timothy Moriarty rendered service as required by sub-section (4) of Section 2 of the Act in the periods from the 1st April, 1921, to the 30th June, 1922, and from the 1st November, 1922, to the 30th September, 1923. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that Patrick McGrath, McCurtain Street, Fermoy, Co. Cork, who was sentenced to five years' penal servitude in connection with the Connaught Rangers mutiny in India, and who joined the National Army in 1923, was discharged in 1924 as medically unfit, that he again joined the National Army and served until July, 1928, when he was discharged with a very good character; that he applied for an Army pension, and whether the Minister will now state what pension McGrath is entitled to. 
     
     
      
       I am aware of the facts as stated in the first part of the question.  There is no record in my Department of the receipt of an application from Mr. McGrath for a pension. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that this man, because he took part in the mutiny, was deprived of his pension?  I wish to inform the Minister that at the present time this man has a wife and six children to support, and were it not for the fact that he received assistance from the St. Vincent de Paul Society, he and his family would be starving during the winter months.  I think it is a crying scandal that a man who has made such sacrifices as this should be allowed to remain in poverty.  I hope the Minister will not turn a deaf ear to the appeal I am making on behalf of this man. 
     
     
     
      
       I am completely circumscribed, of course, by the terms of the Act. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Cow-Testing Association Supervisors 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Agriculture if he has received a copy of a resolution passed by the members of the Donaskeigh Cow-Testing Association, Co. Tipperary, protesting against the dismissal of members who held the position of supervisors, and if he will inquire into those cases and have them reinstated in their positions. 
     
     
      
       I have received the resolution in question, which refers to the only supervisor employed by the Donaskeigh Cow-Testing Association. I am satisfied that the serious remissness of this supervisor in the performance of his duties, which renders it impossible for the Department to recognise the records of the association as sufficiently reliable for registration purposes, or for the payment of grants, was such as to justify the decision not to approve of his further employment in that capacity.  I am not, therefore, prepared to adopt the course suggested in the concluding portion of the question. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that those people are very anxious to have the members who held positions as supervisors reinstated? 
     
     
      
       I doubt that.  The records were all wrong. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Ballylanders Creamery&mdash;Employees' Wages. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he will state the weekly wage of each employee (including the salary of the manager) at the Ballylanders Branch of the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland (Ltd.) 
     
     
      
       I would ask the Deputy to postpone this question until Wednesday next, the 26th instant. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Lord Listowel Estate. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if the Land Commission have acquired or have considered acquiring the lands of Con-vo-more on the estate of Lord Listowel (Ballyhooly, Co. Cork), for the purpose of distribution amongst uneconomic holders in the district. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission have had enquiries made regarding the lands in question and have decided not to take any action for the present. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Scartaglin Turbary Dispute. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he is aware that Thomas P. Brosnan, Dromulton, Scartaglin, Kerry (Captain Fagan estate), who has recently been decreed for land annuities, is entitled to his portion of the 8 acres of turbary reserved by the receiver out of the 25 acres held by Garret Fleming&mdash;this 8 acres being divided into 14 lots, Thomas Brosnan being the 14th tenant; and will the Minister now state that Brosnan will not be compelled to pay arrears until a definite assurance has been given that the plot of turbary, his property, will be handed over to him. 
     
     
      
       When proceedings were pending before the Estates Commissioners for the sale of the Fagan estate by the landlord direct to the tenants under the Irish Land Act, 1903, the landlord made an arrangement with the tenant, Garret Fleming, whereby turbary over 8 acres of Fleming's holding was reserved for the benefit of other tenants, and this reservation was expressed by a clause in the purchase agreement entered into by Fleming with the landlord. 
     
     Apart from the bog on Fleming's holding, the landlord had in hands an area of 78 acres of bog and cutaway bog.  To meet the requirements of the Commissioners in connection with the land purchase proceedings the landlord's agent and surveyor   divided all the bogs mentioned and furnished maps and schedules setting out particulars of turbary plots allotted to the tenants.  By this scheme T.P. Brosnan's deceased father was allotted 6 plots on the bog in the landlord's hands and, in addition, a right of turbary over a plot containing 2 roods 14 perches, which plot forms part of the 8 acres of turbary reserved out of Fleming's holding.  The allottees of turbary refused to sign consents tendered to them in respect of their turbary allotments, and therefore their holdings were vested in them without making any reference to their several turbary plots. 
     Mr. Brosnan was dissatisfied with the amount of turbary allotted to his deceased father, and for years he has been withholding the annuity of the holding in furtherance of his claim. The Land Commission have taken proceedings against Brosnan for recovery of the arrears due in respect of his holding, and they must continue these proceedings in accordance with their statutory duties. 
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Drainage of Scartaglin Turbary. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state when it is the intention of his Department to arrange for the construction of a drain through the 8 acres of turbary reserved by the receiver from the 25 acres held by Garrett Fleming on the Captain Fagan estate, Dromulton, Scartaglin. 
     
     
      
       This estate was sold direct by the landlord to the tenants under the Irish Land Act, 1903, and the Land Commission do not propose to construct the drain referred to. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Logan Estate (Westmeath). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state what action, if any, the Irish Land Commission proposes to take with regard to the acquiring of the Logan estate, situated at Cloonagh, Ballinagore, Co. Westmeath. 
     
     
     
      
       The Land Commission have had inquiries made regarding these lands, and have decided to take no further action regarding their acquisition for the present. 
     
     
      
       On what grounds have they decided not to take further action? 
     
     
      
       It is in the discretion of the Commissioners.  I do not know exactly on what grounds they made up their minds. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister consider the advisability of giving a holiday to the Commissioners in Westmeath? 
     
     
      
       They are taking it themselves. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Ballytoohy Lands (Roscommon). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state when it is the intention of the Land Commission to sub-divide the lands of Ballytoohey, Co. Roscommon (O'Farrell estate); if his attention has been drawn to a report of the Tarmonbarry Boat Club, that the Club intended to purchase portion of the lands from the Land Commission, and if he will give an assurance that no such sale will be sanctioned by the Land Commission, in view of the fact that there are many uneconomic holders in the vicinity who are anxious to acquire additions to their present holdings. 
     
     
      
       The scheme in this estate has not yet been approved by the Commissioners.  The Tarmonbarry Boat Club have, I understand, requested the Land Commission to sell them a plot of ground alongside the river for the purpose of a clubhouse and this matter is under consideration. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Lewis Estate (Galway). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he is aware that it is alleged that the tenancy claimed by Mr. William J. Farren, on the Lewis estate (Galway, S. 1990) is not a genuine   tenancy within the meaning of the Land Act, 1923, and if he will have inquiries instituted in the matter. 
     
     
      
       The holding referred to was returned by the owner as tenanted land in the occupation of W.J. Farren as a yearly tenant and was vested in the Land Commission as such.  As stated in reply to the Deputy's question for 8th May last the holding has been retained by the Land Commission and notice has been served on the tenant of the intention of the Land Commission to apply for an order authorising them to resume the holding.  The tenant has objected to the making of the application and his objection was heard yesterday by the Commissioners in court, when they reserved their decision. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state the various items that made up the purchase price&mdash;£8,650 &mdash;paid by the Land Commission for untenanted land on the Lewis estate (Galway, S. 1990), or whether such information is obtainable at the Land Commission. 
     
     
      
       The answer is in the negative.  As I have already informed the Deputy, the price of £8,650 paid by the Land Commission for the untenanted land on the estate of J.A. Lewis was paid for the lands as a whole. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state why the Land Commission, in dealing with the congested estate of John A. Lewis, Esq., Co. Galway (Record No. S. 1990) have instructed their inspector to interview various tenants on adjoining estates with a view to giving them additional land on the Lewis estate, despite the assurance given on March 7th 1928, and on May 22nd, 1929, that all the Lewis lands would be given to congests on the Lewis estate. 
     
     
      
       It is essential for the Land Commission to have a full knowledge of all the congestion in the neighbourhood of untenanted land   which they are about to divide, and it is the duty of an inspector, prior to preparing a scheme for the division of untenanted land for the consideration of the Commissioners, to make inquiries as to all uneconomic holdings in the neighbourhood of the lands.  The Deputy was informed that the lands on the Lewis estate acquired for division would be utilised for the enlargement of the small holdings on the estate, but he was not informed that they would be used solely for the holdings on the Lewis estate to the exclusion of other congested holdings adjoining which may be in need of enlargement. 
     
   
   
     Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Acquisition of Howard Lands, Galway. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state whether the Land Commission have taken any steps to divide the Abbeygormacan and Gorthmore grass farm (formerly Quansbury, Lord Clonbrock estate), Co. Galway, now held by Mr. B. Howard. 
     
     
      
       The lands referred to are subject to land purchase annuities, and the Land Commission do not propose at present to take any steps with regard to their acquisition. 
     
   
   
     Question on Adjournment. 
     
      
       Deputy Corry desires to raise on the adjournment the subject-matter of question 6.  There is an amendment on the paper&mdash;amendment 7&mdash;but it does not raise the precise point that Deputy Corry wants to raise.  I could not say at the moment whether any section of the Bill would enable the Deputy to raise the point he has in mind.  There may be such a section in the Bill, but I am not quite sure of that. 
     
     
      
       I am quite satisfied. 
     
     
      
       Then we will take that at some other time. Deputy Cooney desires to raise on the adjournment the subject-matter of question 11.  I take it the case of this gentleman is sub judice.  Deputy Cooney wants to draw attention to the treatment given to this man, Mr. Francis Burke, by the Guards while he was in their custody. I think the Deputy is entitled to bring the matter up here, but not in a way that would prejudice the case when it comes before the Court. If the case is to come before the Court it is not desirable to raise it here; but, of course, if the Deputy desires to do so he can raise it.  I take it that Deputy Cooney is going to raise the matter on the adjournment. 
     
   
   
     Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme. 
     
      
       I beg to move: 
     
     &ldquo;Go gceaduitear Sceim Aois-liuntais na Muinteoiri Meanscoile,   1929, a dhin an tAire Oideachais le haontu an Aire Airgid agus do leagadh fe bhraid na Dala De Ceadaoin, 12adh Meitheamh, 1929, fe Acht Aois-liuntais na Muinteoiri, 1928 (Uimh. 32 de 1928). 
     &ldquo;That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme, 1929, made by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and laid before the Dail on Wednesday, 12th June, 1929, under the Teachers Superannuation Act, 1928 (No. 32 of 1928) be approved.&rdquo; 
     This resolution is on the Paper in consequence of a provision in the Teachers Superannuation Act which was passed by the Oireachtas at the end of last November.  Section 5 of that Act lays it down that when the Minister for Education prepares a scheme and has got for that scheme the consent of the Minister for Finance, the scheme shall be brought up for the definite approval of the Dail and the Seanad; not merely that it shall lie on the Table of the House and pass if there is no objection registered, but that there should be definite approval.  So far as the scheme is concerned, the function of the two Houses of the Oireachtas is limited to approval or rejection, naturally, of course, with a discussion of the scheme.  It is proposed to bring the scheme into operation, if it should receive the approval of both Houses, on 1st August next.  On more than one occasion during the last one and a-half years both the Minister for Finance and myself have made it quite clear that any delay in the introduction of the scheme would not be allowed to operate against those who might wish to retire subsequent to 1st January, 1927.  Provision to that effect is made in the scheme. 
     The scheme is a voluntary scheme. In the existing conditions of secondary education in the country, it would not be possible, and it would certainly not be desirable, to make the scheme compulsory.  There are large numbers of people engaged in secondary education who, after   having been engaged in it for a number of years, may leave that particular occupation, cease to belong to that profession, and, by the time that the pension would arrive, or even long before it would arrive, in the normal way, they would already be outside the scheme.  A variety of considerations like that compelled us to make the scheme a voluntary scheme&mdash;voluntary, that is from the point of view of the teacher. 
     The scheme is also a contributory scheme.  Not merely will there be State assistance but, in addition, provision is made for a contribution on the part of the teachers who join the scheme, and also on their behalf on the part of the schools where they teach.  It is voluntary on the part of the teachers.  But if a teacher in any school elects to join the scheme, the scheme then becomes compulsory so far as that school is concerned, and the necessary contribution from the school is deducted on behalf of the teacher.  Pensionable salary is determined by taking what is known as the normal basic salary, £200 in the case of men and £180 in the case of women, and adding to that the increments which the teacher has received at the time of his or her retirement. 
     When the scheme is in full operation, or when the transition stage is passed, it is proposed that he will get one-eightieth for every year of service&mdash;one-eightieth made up in the way I have described.  The contribution on the part of the teacher will be 4 per cent. of his salary&mdash;that is, the salary that I have indicated&mdash; and 21⁄2 per cent. by the school on behalf of the teacher on the basic salary that the school pays to the teacher.  There is a feature of this particular scheme to which I would like to draw attention.  From the teacher's point of view, it is probably the most satisfactory side of this scheme&mdash;the transitional arrangements made to deal with the teachers who, owing to the number of years that they have already served, and the age they have reached, will not be in a condition to make many contributions to the fund.  There are a number of ways in which that problem   could be dealt with.  In another place it was dealt with by giving the teacher who has served about, say, forty years, simply a lump-pension of, say, £120.  That is to continue for a couple of years&mdash;until, I think, the year 1932.  After that, there will be a gradual increase of contributions from individual teachers coming in. 
     I thought a scheme of that kind might press hardly on people for whom a strong case has been made&mdash; those who have already served a number of years.  What we have done, therefore, is to fix the pension of all teachers by giving them a fraction of the number of years they have served.  For that purpose it is necessary to distinguish between two types of service&mdash;that is, the service for which there has been a contribution to the fund by the teacher and by the school, and non-contributory service for which there has been no such contribution.  The pension will be made up by giving one-eightieth for every year of contributory service, and one-hundredth for every year of non-contributory service. 
     The first proposal was to give one-hundred and twentieth for every year of non-contributory service. That in itself might compare somewhat favourably with the scheme that I have referred to.  But such a strong case was put up by the Secondary Teachers' Organisation that we were able to meet them in this respect, and the result is that one-hundredth for every year of service will be given.  Consequently, if we take a man teacher who has at present served forty years he gets, not a pension of £120 but a pension, roughly speaking, of £160.  Of course as the years go on and as the contributions come in, the one-hundredth computation will be replaced by the computation of one-eightieth.  The pension will gradually increase. 
     Provision is also made in this scheme for the repayment of gratuities on death, for the repayment of gratuities to members leaving the scheme, and, if they return to the scheme, for the repayment into the scheme of these gratuities with the accumulated interest.  Provision is   also made for the case of national teachers who cease to be national teachers and become secondary teachers.  They can enter the scheme by paying into the scheme the amount they have received from the National Teachers' Pension Fund with interest thereon.  The other provision of which advantage is being taken is in the case of secondary teachers who may be appointed to appropriate posts in the Civil Service.  What we have done here is to see that their actual teaching service time will not be actually lost; that they will get pensionable benefit from their teaching time. 
     The drafting of that was rather difficult.  The idea would be more or less this&mdash;if a teacher has had ten years' service or, say, fifteen years' service as a teacher, and is appointed an Inspector of National Schools, then, when his time for retirement from the Civil Service comes, he gets a pension made up partly of what is due to him from the Civil Service and partly what was due to him as pension as teacher in the secondary school, but not at the salary at which he left the secondary school.  It would be at a hypothetical salary which is calculated on the assumption of what he would have been receiving if he had remained teaching in the school.  That is really the gist of the appendix to the scheme. It is intended to bring the scheme into force, if the Dail and Seanad approves, on the 1st August, 1929.  I might apologise for the scheme being held up so long, but each drafting of the scheme led to the presentation of new problems and new cases that might arise, but which were actually not met in the scheme.  It is impossible even yet to guarantee that every possible case that might arise has been met in the scheme.  A few months ago, when we thought the scheme was completed, further consideration of the type of case that might present itself showed a recasting was necessary.  That rather complicated the necessary complications, and the difficulty of drafting has led to delay.  As I said, we have taken provision in the scheme to see that as far as possible delay will not   prejudice any features of the scheme.

       There are just one or two points I want to put to the Minister. There is no reference at all to the fact that these payments will entitle the teacher to any relief in income tax.  I would like to know from the Minister if, as in the case of payments for insurance, the teachers would have the same benefit. 
     
     The second point I would like to   put is the case of a teacher subscribing, say, for 30 years to the pension fund, losing his position through no fault of his own and not being able to get another position. If that teacher had to subscribe to an ordinary insurance company he would not suffer the same disadvantage which he might if a certain interpretation was put on those rules. The main point, however, which I wanted to put was with regard to income tax. 
     
      
       That is a matter the Deputy had better put to the Minister for Finance.  This is not a scheme to amend the income tax law. 
     
     
      
       No, but it affects it. 
     
     
      
       This is a case which might be considered by the Minister for Finance in dealing with the income tax law.  It certainly will not be considered here in this scheme. 
     
     
      
       This arose out of a discussion between the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance, and the point might have been discussed by both Ministers. 
     
     
      
       It cannot be dealt with in this scheme.  I say that this point was not put up to me by the people who came on the teachers' behalf.  Deputy Briscoe mentioned the case of a person paying into an insurance company.  Supposing a person does pay into an insurance company for a number of years and then, owing to circumstances over which he has no control, he is no longer able to pay his premium, what happens? 
     
     
      
       His policy has a surrender value. 
     
     
      
       Yes, but very far from what he has paid into the policy. 
     
     
      
       He can renew it. 
     
     
      
       He may be able to.  This scheme provides for the repayment of the contributions to the person who has paid in; in certain   cases for the repayment of contributions with interest.  I think that answers the Deputy's point pretty fully.  My memory is pretty bad at times, but some time ago a deputation came to me.  I think they were asked to do so by the Secondary Teachers' Organisation.  I understood they were to embrace the members of the different parties.  I forget for the moment whether Deputy Fahy was present or not.  I do not think he was, and I do not know whether any member of his Party was present.  The reason I mention that is that a number of points the Deputy put up were actually put up to me by that deputation.  I indicated in a very general way what I hoped to do under this scheme.  They put up certain objections to the lines on which the scheme was going to be framed.  The most important thing they asked me was whether the Minister for Finance would not consent to the increase of the hundredand-twentieth fraction to a one hundredth fraction.  I told them that I would certainly put that before the Minister for Finance and, as I indicated just now, the Minister was able to agree. 
     
     I quite admit these are not Civil Service pension rights, but neither are secondary teachers in any sense of the word Civil Servants.  They are, just as national teachers are, private employees, doing, if you like, as many other people who are private employees do, very useful and essential national work.  The system itself, possibly to a greater extent than the primary system, is essentially a private system, State aided.  That is the reason I cannot admit the cogency of the analogy with the position of the Civil Servant.  The deputation to which I referred and the Association of Secondary Teachers on several occasions did put up this point about the granting of one eightieth plus a lump sum at the time of retirement.  That is, practically speaking, the Civil Service rights of pension.  Though I said I might be able to meet them on other points, I held out no hope to them that I would be able to meet them on that point.  It raises a lot of   issues, but, as I say, I cannot admit the principle in connection with education that the people engaged in education are in any sense State servants or that the system itself in any sense is a State system. 
     With regard to Deputy Fahy's second question, so far as the payment of interest is concerned, we had to follow the usual system. There was the precedent there about the payment and repayment of 3 per cent. and there were implications involved here that in themselves might be small, but in other matters might be large.  We simply followed the system of the other pension scheme. With regard to the ten years' salary, actually a time comes, as the Deputy knows, in this scheme where, if a person retires owing to ill-health, he really gets much better terms than a year's salary.  No suggestion has been made that the year's salary should equate everything on every side of the ten year limit up to twenty years.  On the whole, the scheme as it stands is much better than the year's salary for those with a certain number of years' service. 
     
      
       What objection has the Minister, then, to putting in this clause? 
     
     
      
       I said &ldquo;on the whole.&rdquo;  Would the Deputy be satisfied to level down as well as level up? 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       I thought not.  We are treating the teachers quite fairly in the matter.  The Deputy has put a question as to compelling schools to pay the minimum salary.  He has put the case this way: The scheme is based on the assumption of a minimum salary plus normal increments.  Pension is paid on that assumption.  Contributions are levied on that assumption. The contribution is paid by the school on the assumption that £200 per man is paid, and contribution is paid by the teacher on the assumption that he gets £200, plus increments.   The Deputy points out that there are a number of teachers who do not get paid the basic salary.  He asked: why not compel the schools to pay the basic salary.  Supposing I tried to compel the schools to pay that basic salary, I might really compel them to get rid of a teacher. Very often a school has more teachers on its list than it is required to have by the regulations. 
       As the Deputy knows, the regulations allow a considerable latitude to the school between the number it must have for recognition for the school and the number it may have, so that the teachers will all be paid an incremental salary.  It is quite possible that if any attempt were made to insist that all teachers above the minimum number get paid the full basic rate by the school, the school would say: &ldquo;While we are satisfied with your regulation about the minimum salary, we cannot afford to pay more.  If you insist on that, our choice is the dismissal of the teacher.&rdquo;  I notice that that was not a point that was put before me, so far as I can remember, as far as this scheme was concerned, by the Secondary Teachers' Organisation. 
     
     
      
       Economic pressure. 
     
     
      
       On the school also.  I think they would realise the unwisdom of trying to compel the school to pay the basic salary.  The last question raised by the Deputy does not concern this particular scheme.  So far as this scheme is concerned, men and women are treated equally. 
       Question put and agreed to. 
     
   
   
     Railways (Amendment) Bill, 1929&mdash;Second Stage. 
     
      
       I ask for a Second Reading of the Railways (Amendment) Bill, 1929, the purport of which appears from a reading of the four sections.  Under the Railways Act, 1924, three standing members were appointed to the Railway Tribunal, the term of office being five years.  Section 13 of the Act of 1924   provided that at the end of five years these three should retire and be eligible for re-election.  Under that Act, if re-elected&mdash;the Tribunal as established then was a tribunal of three persons&mdash;these three members would each hold office for a subsequent period of five years.  It was considered that during the operation of the five-year period the work of the tribunal would have diminished to such an extent that there would be no necessity for a tribunal of three members or for a tribunal with another five years to run.  The Bill provides that on the expiry of the term of office of the present members there should be leave to decrease the number and the appointment should be from year to year. 
     
     
      
       I should be glad if the Minister would give us an amplification of the statement that at the end of another five years the work of the Tribunal will have so diminished that there will be no necessity for a Tribunal at all.  The case that can be made for the reduction of the Railway Tribunal to one member is a good one, and it is a wise economy to effect at this stage.  I do not see that the case for the abolition of the Railway Tribunal is as good, and the Minister seemed to imply that the next step would be taken before the five years of its existence would have lapsed.  I should be glad if the Minister would amplify that statement, and give us a clearer insight into what is in his mind concerning this matter. 
     
     
      
       Provision is made in this Bill to reduce the term of office of the standing members of the Railway Tribunal to one year, and to enable the number of members to be reduced to one.  It seems to me very strange that the Minister should consider reducing the number of members of the Tribunal from three to one before the standard charges dealt with in Part III. of the Act have been settled. 
     
     
      
       It will not be done. 
     
     
     
      
       I would like the Minister to give some indication as to when the standard charges and the Appointed Day will be settled. 
     
     
      
       That depends on the Court. 
     
     
      
       I would point out that under the provisions of the Act of 1924 the Tribunal was composed of three members, one of whom was an ex-railway manager, the other an accountant with considerable commercial experience, and the third was a judge.  I presume that when the number of members has been reduced from three to one the remaining member will neither have commercial nor railway experience though he may be called on at any time to decide new matters arising out of the railway situation.  A development of this kind might far outweigh any saving in salary of the two members whose services have been dispensed with.  I would ask the Minister to state what powers the Tribunal exercises in regard to agreements reached between the Great Southern Railways and other transport undertakings.  The Minister will recollect that some time ago an agreement between the Dublin United Tramways Company and the Great Southern Railways Company in regard to the Dublin to Dalkey district was vetoed at the dictation of the Railway Tribunal.  We have, on the other hand, no indication whether authority was given by the Tribunal to the Great Southern Railways Company to enter into an agreement with the Irish Omnibus Company.  So far as that agreement is concerned, it has been stated by a person with accountancy experience that the agreement was apparently made by the representatives of the Irish Omnibus Company who held revolvers, so to speak, at the heads of the representatives of the Railway Company.  I am sure that the Minister will not deny that so far as that agreement is concerned the Railway Company came badly out of it. 
     
     
      
       I submit that that is not relevant to the Bill. 
     
     
     
      
       I am dealing with the Tribunal appointed under the Act. 
     
     
      
       The Bill does not deal with the authority of the Railway Tribunal. 
     
     
      
       The question which I wish to ask the Minister is in regard to the agreement between the Irish Omnibus Company and the Great Southern Railways Company. 
     
     
      
       Is this relevant? 
     
     
      
       No.  The Deputy's first point in regard to the remaining member possibly having neither railway nor commercial experience is relevant but the other point is not.  I do not think that he can go into the question of the agreement between the Irish Omnibus Company and the Railway Company. 
     
     
      
       I do not intend to. What I want to ask the Minister is whether the Tribunal, which has certain powers, and which has put them into operation in regard to the agreement between the Dublin Tramways Company and the Railway Company, has any authority in regard to the agreement between the Irish Omnibus Company and the Railway Company.  I presume that the object of the present Bill is to economise, but I submit, so far as the railway situation is concerned, that, if the Minister wanted to wield the economy axe he should have wielded it in a better way and in a direction in which there would be much more scope for its operation, with less serious consequences to all concerned.  If the electricity supply of the country can be managed and controlled by a board of five, I submit that, so far as the Southern Railways Company is concerned, there is no administrative or economic justification for a board of fifteen. 
     
     
      
       Does the Deputy think that on this Bill, which proposes to reduce the term of office and the number of members of the Railway Tribunal, he can deal with the number of directors of the   Board of the Great Southern Company? 
     
     
      
       The reason I mention it is to show that although there are fifteen directors of the Great Southern Company, drawing over £700 a year each, the company is really controlled by one director who is not a representative of the company but who has been nominated by an English company. 
     
     
      
       Again I ask is this relevant? 
     
     
      
       I have given the Deputy two opportunities of keeping to the Bill.  I think he ought to come to it now. 
     
     
      
       The reason that I brought in the reference was to show that the Tribunal is going to be a one-man affair&mdash;composed of one member who has neither railway nor commercial experience. That being so and in view of the fact that the Great Southern Company is being run by one director, I think that the Minister should give a better explanation to the House of this particular arrangement. If it were possible that savings would result by having the Tribunal composed of one member with no railway or commercial experience I would like to know how such economy could be brought about.  I say that the Great Southern Company, as controlled by a director who has £7,000 a year from an English company and who has really got no interest in it from a public point of view, should be able to effect economies in that department. 
     
     
      
       I would like the Minister to explain what will happen eventually.  I do not understand what he intends to do under the Bill. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Cassidy said that the Great Southern Company is controlled by someone who is working in the interest of another railway.  I would like to ask him what proof he has of that. 
     
     
      
       We can   have no discussion on that.  It was an irrelevant remark and I presume that the Deputy has not proof. 
     
     
      
       I have proof and can produce it if needed. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy cannot produce it now. 
     
     
      
       I desire to state that I have not said that there will be no Tribunal within the next five years.  So long as this Bill remains there must be a Tribunal.  The only power given is to reduce the number of members to one.  The reason it is expected that the personnel can be reduced to one member is that the duties put upon the first Tribunal will to a great extent disappear. Standard charges will have been fixed and the Appointed Day declared. Deputy Cassidy, however, is afraid that that will not be done because it is going to be reduced before the Appointed Day is declared. That is not so.  It is not stated in the Bill.  The Deputy will have to wait to see what order will be issued by the Governor-General on the advice of the Executive Council.  It is quite obvious that if the Governor-General is advised to that effect the two ordinary members of the Tribunal will disappear and there will be a Tribunal composed of a judicial member.  His capacity to deal with the duties that will then come before him will be one of the matters which will be under consideration when the Governor-General is advised to issue, the order.  The powers of the Tribunal are neither being enlarged nor diminished, as the Bill is intended only to reduce the numbers of the Tribunal and their term of office.  I am not concerned with the directors of the Great Southern Company nor with Deputy Cassidy's allegations about them.  In reply to Deputy Lemass, as to what will happen under this Bill, I am taking powers to prevent myself being landed in the position that in August next I would either have no tribunal or would have to appoint people for three years more. 
     
     
     
      
       That may be quite right and I imagine that the House will agree with that, but some indication of what is actually in the mind of the Minister should be made available for the House. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister state definitely that the membership of the Railway Tribunal will not be reduced until the standard charges have been declared? 
     
     
      
       I do not think it is possible to reduce the Tribunal until the standard charges have been declared. 
     
     
      
       But is it the present intention that the members of the Tribunal shall remain until the standard charges have been declared? 
     
     
      
       That matter has not been considered by the Executive Council.  The only matter before them was whether it was right that in August we should be faced with a situation as a result of which we would have to appoint three people for five years or appoint nobody. 
     
     
      
       Are we to take it that the old position still holds? 
     
     
      
       What was that? 
     
     
      
       That three members shall constitute the Tribunal? 
     
     
      
       The Deputy can take it for granted that the Executive Council have not had the matter formally brought before them and have not said that any change should be made. 
     
     
      
       I am a lot wiser. 
     
     
      
       They have not discussed it. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 26th June. 
     
   
   
     Totalisator Bill, 1929&mdash;Second Stage. 
     
      
       I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  This Bill consists of the totalisator sections of the Betting Bill which has only a temporary life.  The people who are most   interested in racing are very anxious that the totalisator should be set up here.  It is not possible to make arrangements to have the totalisator set up because of the capital outlay that will be involved under the provisions of the temporary Act.  On the other hand it has been alleged that it would be most undesirable to wait until the new Betting Bill could have been prepared and passed by the House.  Consequently this Bill has been introduced.  It is proposed, if this Bill be passed, to give a licence to operate the totalisator jointly to the Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  It will be a condition of the licence that these two bodies shall delegate the management of the totalisator to a committee which will consist of three representatives of each of them, a representative of the Metropolitan Race Meeting Executives, a representative of the Provincial Meeting Executives, and two members representing the breeders, owners and trainers.  It is also proposed that the Government's receipts should be two per cent. of the total takings of the totalisator.  The powers in the Bill, enabling the Revenue Commissioners to set up and work the totalisator, are powers that will not be exercised unless in case of a break down of the negotiations with the bodies represented or some other circumstance that would make it necessary for a Government Department to set up the totalisator in order to have it actually worked and tried out here. 
     
     
      
       We are in favour of the principle of the Bill for two reasons.  While we do not accept the viewpoint that betting is ethically wrong, we realise that in certain circumstances it may be very detrimental to the community as a whole.  We are in favour, therefore, so far as it can be done within reasonable limits, of having betting regularised.  We also feel that if betting is to be regularised and if the State is to derive a revenue from betting, some proportion of that revenue should be devoted to encouraging horse-racing, not so much   because it is a pastime which everyone will approve of, but because it is considered&mdash;at least, so far as I personally, and the members of the Joint Committee which was appointed to consider the operations of the Betting Act are concerned&mdash;to be a pastime essential to the welfare and the development of the horse breeding industry in the country. I, and I think a number of others who know the conditions under which Irish racing has been carried on, feel that the present system of betting on race courses has not been such as to inspire confidence in the mind of the public in the straightness and probity of those who own, run and ride horses on race courses.  There is some feeling that the private bookmaker has acquired an undue influence over certain people associated with the sport, and it is thought that the establishment of the totalisator, by curbing and restricting that influence in some way, will help to secure cleaner and straighter running of horses on race courses, and to improve the quality of the entertainment offered to those who like to go there for wagering purposes. In that way it is hoped to make Irish racing of more interest to the public and to increase the appeal of what has been called the shop-window of Irish horse-breeding to the public generally.  For these reasons we are in favour of the general principles of the Bill.  It is possible that when it comes to Committee we may have some amendments to put down. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 26th June. 
     
   
   
     In Committee on Finance. 
     The Dail went into Committee on Finance. 
   
   
     Finance Bill, 1929&mdash;Money Resolution. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
     
     &ldquo;Go bhfuil se oiriunach a udaru go gcuirfar mar mhuirear ar an   bPrimh-Chiste no ar a thora fais aon tsuimeanna a hiocfar le Ciste na gCairteacha Coigiltis (Cothromu Muirear Uis) fe aon Acht a rithfar sa tSioson so chun diuitethe airithe de Chustuim agus Ioncum Duithche maraon le Mal d'eileamh agus do ghearra, chun an dli a bhaineann le Custuim agus Ioncum Duithche maraon le Mal do leasu, agus chun tuille foralacha i dtaobh Airgid do dheanamh. 
     &ldquo;That it is expedient to authorise the Charge upon the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of any sums paid to the Savings Certificates (Interest Charge Equalisation) Fund under any Act of the present Session to charge and impose certain duties of Customs and Inland Revenue, including Excise, to amend the law relating to Customs and Inland Revenue, including Excise, and to make further provisions in connection with Finance.&rdquo; 
     This Resolution is necessary before the clause in the Bill which provides for the funds to meet the interest accruing on Savings Certificates can be taken in Committee.  I have already in the Budget statement explained the need and the reasons for the establishment of this fund.  The amount of debt owing in respect of Savings Certificates is already considerable. It is a growing amount and it would not longer be possible to allow the interest to accumulate without at the same time accumulating a fund to meet it.  It is intended for the future to have a sufficient amount put aside each year to meet any interest which is to accrue in that year and which has not been paid.  It is also intended gradually to wipe out the accumulated sum which has not already been provided for by means of some extra provision in each year. 
     
      
       The Minister has said that a certain amount of interest had accumulated and was accumulating. What is the amount now? 
     
     
      
       It is difficult to get an exact figure because something in the nature of actuarial calculations would be required. 
     
     
     
      
       A close approximation? 
     
     
      
       About £400,000. 
     
     
      
       This is money that ought really to have been met out of previous budgeting.  The Minister is now disclosing, and confessing in a very careful manner, £400,000 that he ought to have accumulated reserves for in the past, and that he has not accumulated reserves for. He is making a death-bed repentance, to the extent that he will in future, as long as he is allowed to remain, pay his current debts and try and slightly absolve his conscience, or leave it to his successors to absolve his conscience, of the £400,000 that he ought to have paid. If the Minister had frankly said that it would have been more respectful to the Dail and more in keeping with the responsibilities of his position. It ought not to be necessary to extract information of that kind by cross-examination from a Minister for Finance.  Other Ministers may perhaps be allowed some little latitude in these matters, but that this should have been kept from the country up to now, and should only be in this manner casually disclosed, suggests that when it comes to someone else's business to audit the actual conduct of financial affairs in the past by the Minister, we may find that his conscience is loaded with a great deal more than the £400,000 which he has now disclosed. 
       Resolution put and agreed to. 
       The Dail went out of Committee. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dail agree with the Committee in the said Resolution&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     
   
   
     Finance Bill, 1929&mdash;Committee. 
     The Dail went into Committee. 
     SECTION I. 
     (1)  Income Tax shall be charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1929, at the rate of three shillings in the pound. 
     (2)  Sur-tax shall be charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1929, at the same rates as those at which it was charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1928. 
     
        (3)  The several statutory and other provisions which were in force during the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1928, in relation to income tax and sur-tax shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have effect in relation to the income tax and the sur-tax to be charged as aforesaid for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1929. 
     
      
       I move amendment 1:&mdash; 
       Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1920, is hereby amended by the substitution of fifty pounds for thirty-six pounds and of forty pounds for twenty-seven pounds as the deductions in respect of children.&rdquo; 
       The amendment which appears on the Order Paper unfortunately is not the amendment which I intended should appear on the Order Paper.  It relates to Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1920, and is to increase the allowance made in respect of children.  The amendment which we had drafted, and which, unfortunately, owing to a Standing Order of the Dail, is out of order, provided that the increased allowance in respect of children should only be granted to those whose incomes are less than £400 per annum.  We had as a complement to that proposal, and in order to ensure that no additional burden would be cast upon the taxpayer, proposed originally to decrease the allowance in respect of children to those whose incomes are more than £400.  As originally worded, the amendment read as it appears on the Order Paper, with the following addendum: 
     
     in respect of an income of more than £400, to proportionate deductions in respect of one child and each subsequent child, which proportionate deductions shall in each case be equal to the basic allowance or allowances, less a pro rata reduction or reductions   in such allowance or allowances of twenty per cent. of income in excess of £400. 
     We thought by the machinery provided in the latter portion of the amendment to compensate the Exchequer for the loss in revenue which would undoubtedly result, if the amendment as it now stands on the Order Paper were to be adopted by the House.  But, as the latter part&mdash;the addendum which I have read&mdash;in so far as it curtails the allowances made to those in receipt of larger incomes, would contravene the Standing Order of the Dail which precludes a private Deputy, or other than a member of the Executive Council, from proposing a resolution to the House which makes a charge upon the taxpayer, it, of course, does not appear on the Order Paper. We on this side of the House feel that we would prefer that the Minister should pay his way, rather than that he should continue the practice, which he is now endeavouring to discontinue, of putting upon the long finger and refusing to make provision for those liabilities which immediately fall due&mdash;that he should pay his way, rather than that he should involve the State in greater debt than he has.  We feel, of course, that any remission of taxation possible, particularly any remission of income tax at this particular moment, is hardly justified and for that reason I am almost prepared to withdraw the amendment as it appears on the Order Paper. 
     I have really only put it down in order that our proposal might be put, even in this somewhat irregular way, before the House, because we do feel that there should be some sort of redistribution of the burden of taxation among the people of the country. As I showed in my speech, I think on the general Financial Resolution, the burden of indirect taxation has increased altogether disproportionately to the burden of taxation which is imposed directly on the people, and as direct taxation hits most heavily the poorer classes, and I suppose particularly those who have just come   within the ambit of income tax, we felt when we were considering the Finance Bill that we should endeavour to secure some redistribution in order to lighten the burden of the income tax upon the lower middle class taxpayer, and, if possible, compensate the Exchequer for the revenue which would thereby be lost to it by restricting the allowances which have been made to the richer income taxpayer.  As I said, I feel a difficulty in proposing the amendment in its present form, but I should like if the Minister, instead of dealing with the amendment on the Order Paper, would deal with the amendment which has been ruled out, to give us some idea as to whether he himself in future legislation will consider some proposal of the sort to increase the allowance to the smaller income tax payer and, if possible, to compensate the Exchequer for the loss in revenue which would thereby be incurred, by increasing, if you like, the burden, or restricting the allowances at the other end of the scale. 
     
      
       I indicated before&mdash; I think in my Budget statement&mdash; that we had during the year considered a scheme along the lines that Deputy MacEntee desires.  We tried to get compensation largely by reducing the half-rate allowance&mdash;the amount in respect of which it is given&mdash;but we found that there would still be a fairly substantial loss.  If our Budget position had been such that that scheme could have been put into operation without the actual imposition of new taxation outside the income tax scheme, I should certainly have adopted it, but I would not care to find further relief for income tax payers by an increase in indirect taxation, and we, therefore, felt obliged to put the proposal aside for the present. 
     
     I am desirous of giving some increase in the reliefs available for the smaller income tax-payer rather on the lines given in England, if that could be done within our income tax system.  I would like to look at the proposals the Deputy has   put up, but proposals that we had ourselves and that seemed to us to be practicable left a substantial amount to be found.  The real position is that it is impossible to accept this amendment because the money would have to be found by some new charges.  As to the alternative methods of meeting the loss, I am willing to have them further looked into.  It is too early yet to prophesy what the position will be in the next Budget, and I do not feel, therefore, that I can give any promise. 
     
      
       As I said, we are not anxious to press this amendment to a division, and I ask leave to withdraw it. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
     
     
      
       I move amendment 2: 
       To insert before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1920, is hereby amended by the deletion of the words &lsquo;equal to one-tenth of the amount of that income&rsquo; and the substitution therefor of the following:&mdash; 
       (a)  in respect of an income of less than £400, equal to one-sixth of the amount of that income; and 
       (b)  in respect of an income in excess of four hundred pounds, £66 13s. 4d., together with a sum equal to one-tenth of the amount of that income in excess of four hundred pounds.&rdquo; 
     
     This amendment is designed to remove the disproportion which exists between the charges on earned and unearned incomes here as compared with the corresponding charges in Great Britain.  The rate of income tax here upon certain incomes is nominally 3/- in the £; in Great Britain, the rate is 4/-.  Here, however, the actual amount paid by a married taxpayer who does not receive allowance in respect of children and who is in receipt of an earned income of £300 is £3 7s. 6d., whereas the amount paid in Great Britain upon a corresponding income is only £2 10s. 0d.  In the case of a married taxpayer in receipt of an   income of £400, the tax paid here is £10 2s. 6d., as against £10 17s. 0d. which, in the same circumstances, would have to be paid in Great Britain.  If, however, the income happens to be unearned, then the income taxpayer here only pays £11 5s. on £300, as compared with £15 on the same income in Great Britain.  And if his unearned income happens to be £400, he pays £26 5s. 0d. here, as against £35 on the same income in Great Britain. Thus, in the case of an unearned income of £400, the Irish taxpayer would enjoy, over and above the British taxpayer, the sum of £8 15s. 0d., while if he earned his income that advantage would be reduced to 14s. 6d.  Now, if the income was only £300, the advantage would vanish altogether, and instead he would pay 17s. 6d. more than the British taxpayer.  In the case of a single man with £300 income, the sum of £10 2s. 6d. is paid in the Free State and £23 in Great Britain. It would seem to us that the incidence of taxation here is inequitable as compared with the manner in which taxation is distributed in Great Britain. 
     We ought to realise that when a person has to earn his income the amount of the real income he enjoys is probably very much less than the amount of real income a person in receipt of dividends or interest or some other form of unearned income enjoys.  We think, in view of the fact that a greater number of people here have to earn their incomes and that the present distribution of the tax, particularly as between the poorer man who earns his income and the poorer man who enjoys unearned income, seems to be unduly favourable to the person in receipt of unearned income, some attempt should be made to equalise the burden.  Accordingly we suggest a remission here that would go to equalise the burden between them. For that reason we have put down the amendment as it stands on the Order Paper. 
     
      
       The cost of the   adoption of this amendment would be as nearly as can be calculated round about £110,000 per annum. Now, I have to use the argument against that that I used against the other; that is, that if the amendment were adopted some new proposals for taxation would have to be introduced to meet the deficit.  I know that it will be felt undesirable if at any time the reliefs given to the tax-payer lower down the scale here are less than in Great Britain.  But I do not know that if we were to bring our allowances to the British level this year we could adopt it as a principle that we would keep them at the British level.  It may well be that in Great Britain there will be further allowances.  Now, the income tax operates rather differently here from Great Britain.  I have not the figures worked out to cover this point, but I think Deputies will understand readily enough that any allowance would lose us a very much greater proportion of our taxation than in England.  In England a very much higher proportion of the tax is paid by extremely wealthy people.  I once indicated that in the Dail by showing that a tax at the same rate gives a very much lower yield per head of the population here than in England.  That means that in England the wealthy taxpayers are more numerous, and that the relief given to the poorer taxpayers loses a much less proportion of the revenue.  It is quite possible that something that would cause us to lose 10 per cent. of revenue might only cause them in Great Britain to lose two, or even one, per cent., so that it is impossible for us to adopt as a principle that we should have our allowances equivalent to the British scale. 
       The relief in respect of earned income is one of the matters which I feel desirous to attend to along with the increase of allowances for children, but again, I would like to deal with it when it can be done either by shifting the burden of the income tax or by way of relief from taxation, but not by finding the money through the imposition of new charges. 
     
     
     
      
       The Minister's argument with regard to both amendments can be put in a sentence: You cannot get blood out of a stone. That is its meaning, and that particular argument for the moment is unanswerable.  The difficulty is: the Minister went further, and in defending that particular argument he is indicting income tax as a tax applied to this country. 
       He says: &ldquo;I want to increase all these allowances; I am full of the milk of human kindness in relation to these poor people, these people on whom income tax does lie as a burden.&rdquo; Otherwise the Minister would not be concerned to increase it.  He said: &ldquo;I recognise that in this country there are a large proportion of people who, under income tax, suffer as distinct from merely paying.&rdquo;  Everything that he has said as to the amount which he will lose over and above the amount which would be lost by the same provision in another country is a statement that the income tax as applied to this country is a greater hardship than the income tax as applied to another country.  So long as he realises that and will allow that little seed to germinate in his mind between now and the next time he introduces a Budget, I am satisfied. 
     
     
      
       Could the Minister supply the House with figures showing what the loss would be supposing a system such as the English system were adopted&mdash;that is to say, with regard to unearned income? 
     
     
      
       I could not supply the Deputy with the information just now, but I could give him an answer if he put me a question later, or perhaps drew attention to the matter the next day on which this Bill comes up. Calculations have been made, and it is only a matter of bringing them up-to-date. 
       Amendment 2, by leave, withdrawn. 
     
     
      
       It has been suggested that we could take amendments 3 and 4 together and, in the circumstances, I shall now move them:&mdash; 
     
     
        3.  To insert before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
     If any claimant proves that any portion of his income arose directly from stocks, shares or other investments in a manufacturing undertaking (or undertakings, as the case may be) established in Saorstat Eireann he shall, for the purpose of arriving at his assessable income, be entitled to a deduction of one-fifth of the income which thus arose. 
     4.  To insert before sub-section (3) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
     If any claimant proves that any portion of his earned income arose directly from profits in a manufacturing undertaking (or undertakings, as the case may be) carried on in Saorstat Eireann, then for the purpose of arriving at his assessable income, he shall be entitled, in addition to the earned income allowance already provided for under Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1920, to a further deduction of one-tenth of such portion of his income as arose as aforesaid, but such deduction shall not exceed £200 in the case of any individual. 
     There is a slight misprint in amendment 3.  It should be one-fourth instead of one-fifth.  The principle of these two amendments is the principle which we have often urged upon the Minister of endeavouring by way of remission or allowance in the Income Tax Acts to give some encouragement to Irish manufacturers.  The purpose is to render Irish productive and manufacturing enterprises more attractive to the Irish investor.  So far as the first amendment is concerned, we feel that in addition to rendering the enterprises more directly attractive by giving to the person who has invested in an Irish undertaking certain more favourable treatment under the Income Tax Acts, it will counteract the tendency which the present low rates of tax upon unearned income have to make foreign investments more attractive to the citizens of the Saorstat.  It may seem a surprising   statement to make, but it is nevertheless true that the lower income tax here makes foreign investments more attractive. 
     I gave an instance last year for which I worked out the figures.  I had in mind then a shipping company which in that year paid a dividend of 7 per cent. and whose £1 shares were then standing in the market at 30/-.  It is a very well-managed concern, old and prosperous, and the holders of shares at present, in view of the market price of the stock, have hopes that in time the capital value of the shares will appreciate.  Obviously the marginal price at which the British investor would purchase shares in the particular undertaking that I had in mind at that time, in the conditions which then prevailed, went round about 30/-.  If a British resident had £750 to invest in a concern of that sort and felt anxious to purchase shares in that undertaking, he would buy 500 of them and in due course would receive a nominal dividend of £35.  Out of this dividend 4/- in the pound, or £7, would be retained for income tax, making his actual net gain on that investment only £28.  Take the case of the Irish investor in present circumstances. If he bought those shares at the same price he would receive the same nominal dividend of £35, and because he would be liable to an income tax of only 3/- in the pound, he would recover £1 15/- out of the £7 originally deducted from his dividend in respect of British income tax.  If we allow 5/- to cover his time and trouble and the cost of recovering the £1 15/-, we find that the amount of income tax which would be deducted from his dividend in that particular investment, instead of being £7 as in the case of the British investor, would be only £5 10/-, so that his return would be 30/- more, or 5.375 per cent. greater, than that of the British investor. 
     What is the position then?  The net return which will find the stock a ready market in Great Britain is   only 3.75 per cent.  The Irish resident would receive 3.94 per cent. of the stock, and as the market for the stock is made in Great Britain, Irish buying which, as compared with British buying, will be, of course, comparatively small, will not tend to send up the price of the stock in Great Britain.  The Irish investor, therefore, will be always in a position to pick it up at what will appear to him to be a reasonably cheap price as compared with the British investor. You have, then, the stock which can be bought by the Irish investor just at a price which will leave him more than the marginal return.  He knows he can go in there and have a slight margin to play with, not a very large one, and as he finds the British people are buying it and looking at the investment with the history of the company in mind, noticing how the shares have appreciated during previous years, he will say to himself: &ldquo;I have a chance here, and if I do come in on this stock it will appreciate in value, and I will do very well out of it.&rdquo; 
     Therefore, indirectly, when he looks at the Irish concern, the position is slightly different.  The Irish concern, in the same circumstances, does not appear to him to offer the same favourable advantages.  He does not receive anything when he invests in that.  The net return he receives from an Irish concern is not anything over and above what his neighbour in Ireland will receive. When he has a choice between the two, it always appears to him that the British investment is the more desirable one.  We ought to endeavour to counteract that.  We can do so by the amendment which we have down here and which will definitely make an Irish investment always more attractive to the Irish investor than the English one.  That is, all other things being equal. 
     I know it will be said the trouble about Irish investments is that the people have saved money and that naturally when they have saved money, often with great costs and great pains to themselves, they must be very careful as to how they are going to invest it.  They will not   have the same confidence in Irish investments because of the conditions which prevailed here up to recently, and because the past conditions or the present conditions of Irish investments do not appear to be as sound or as safe to the Irish investor as conditions of investments across the water.  I am only arguing on the appearance of the case.  I am not going to say that an investment in a sound Irish industrial undertaking is not much better in the long run than investments in some flotations which have recently been placed upon the British markets.  But if the case is that an investment in Irish securities, even under present circumstances, appears to an Irish investor to be more speculative, though in fact it may not be so, than an English investment, we ought, in the present state of income tax, to offer to the Irish investor some inducement to overcome that, something which would make the Irish investment, notwithstanding all the disadvantages it may suffer on account of the condition of affairs, definitely more attractive to him than a foreign investment. 
     There has been a great deal of money going out of the country.  It has been calculated that our investments abroad amount to over £200,000,000.  We have found recently that some of the flotations made here, though backed by Government security, are such that the Irish investor appears to be chary about putting his money into them. Possibly the disposition of the market recently does not seem to be properly gauged, and the return offered on the investment may be too low.  We could make that return more attractive by increasing it in this way.  Before that is done, we may possibly consider whether by means of the income tax we could not make the investment more attractive. 
     In regard to the amendment, as it appears on the Order Paper, there is a misprint&mdash;&ldquo;shall be entitled to a deduction of one-fifth.&rdquo;  That should be &ldquo;one-fourth.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance said last year that he did not think, as it then stood, that the inducement which was offered to the   investor was sufficiently large.  I propose to meet the Minister by increasing the remission by 20 per cent., that is, raising it to one-fourth instead of one-fifth, as it was last year. 
     
      
       We of the Labour Party have indicated our position in relation to the incidence of income tax for the last few years.  I am supporting the amendment of Deputy MacEntee, and I rather regret that we have not taken amendments 3, 4 and 5 together, because much of what I would like to say on amendments 3 and 4, I would also like to say on amendment 5. 
       Last week, I advocated that certain reliefs should be given to Irish capitalists, Irish industrialists or other persons having money to invest in Irish industry.  This is one of the ways in which this relief might be given.  I rather regret that Deputy MacEntee has withdrawn his first two amendments, because I feel that we should have an indication from every Deputy in the House as to his position in relation to this very important question. The Minister for Finance himself has stated that there is a great difference between the effects of income tax in this country and the effects of income tax in Great Britain.  We see in every phase of our social life the disparity that exists between the present tax in this country and the present and corresponding tax in another country. If there are any two amendments on the Order Paper that have a stronger appeal than any others, they are those two in the name of Deputy MacEntee.  I do not want to refer to amendment No. 1, but really I find myself in complete sympathy with every amendment on the paper. 
       
         An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  took the Chair. 
     
     
      
       Deputy MacEntee, in the first case, asked for relief in the case of children, but, unfortunately, he withdrew that amendment. I would like to have some indication from the Deputies in the House, irrespective of Party, as to   what they think of matters of this kind.  I would also like an expression of opinion from the Minister with regard to the future policy of his Government on the questions opened up by these amendments.  I have not the figures to date as far as they relate to Irish money invested abroad, but some years ago I was rather alarmed at, to me, the extraordinary figures then published as to the moneys of Irish capitalists, financiers and others invested in foreign securities.  One of the ways by which we could attract that money to this country is indicated in these amendments.  The relief asked for is &ldquo;one-fourth of the income which thus arose.&rdquo;  I think that is the least contribution which this House should make towards Irish industrialists who have had, under the circumstances that have obtained in this country, to invest their money in foreign securities. 
       In discussing this matter, a prominent financier some years ago told me that even if a slight encouragement were given to him, by way of relief in income tax for money invested in Irish enterprises, he and many associated with him would gladly invest their money in Irish industries.  I suggested to him that he was getting better value for his money in this country than in other countries, and he, in turn, told me that even as a financier he was not altogether bankrupt in patriotism. He believed that he would undoubtedly get as good a return for his money here as he was getting abroad if the difference were made up by way of income tax or otherwise. 
     
     I suggest that Deputy MacEntee should not withdraw this amendment, but should have the courage that the Labour Party have had all along and should press this matter.  I am not over-anxious for a division in the House, but we want a clear indication from the Government, from the Cumann na nGaedheal, and the Fianna Fail   Party, too, as to their attitude in relation to this matter.  These two amendments, to me at any rate, are the most attractive on the Order Paper to-day.  They certainly propose something constructive.  I rather welcome that on the part of the Fianna Fail Party as, at least, their second or third effort to do something constructive in Irish politics.  I hope this thing will be persisted in, and that Fianna Fail will not withdraw these two amendments, but will let us have an indication from the House of what it thinks on what is a purely business proposition. 
     
      
       I will deal for a moment with what Deputy Anthony has said.  I feel if Deputy Anthony were here when the Minister was dealing with my amendments possibly he would not have uttered the strictures which he has on my attitude in withdrawing them.  The Minister quite frankly admitted what we know to be the case, and in this matter we had to take a sympathetic view of his difficulty that he does not know where he is to find the money.  We would be very anxious if we could possibly manage to press to a division and carry in this House amendments 1 and 2 in my name, but when the Minister tells us he cannot find the money, and that if he is going to make these remissions with regard to income tax he has got to compensate himself for it by increasing the burden on the poorer classes who pay indirect taxation, we on those benches could not stand over that.  We realise that the lot of the income tax payer is hard, but we realise that there is a considerable section of the population in this country who are not sufficiently fortunate to pay income tax.  There may be degrees of misfortune. Below the income tax payer there is a degree lower still. Consequently we could not feel ourselves justified in pressing to a division an amendment which would result in the income tax payer receiving an advantage at the expense of his less fortunate brethren. For that reason we withdraw 1 and 2. 
     
     
     
      
       On a point of correction&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I do not want a discussion on amendments 1 and 2, which have been withdrawn.  Amendments 3 and 4 are before the House. 
     
     
      
       With reference to amendments 3 and 4, this matter has been discussed before.  There was one aspect which I do not know was the subject of much discussion but which I think deserves a little attention and that is the question of complexity. Everybody is in favour of simplifying the income tax code, but simplification can only be brought about if we are determined that we keep the purposes of the income tax code to the collection of revenue and the allowance of such personal exemptions as can be afforded and as seem equitable.  If we try to attain a great number of objects or if we try to attain objects outside the collection of revenue by the provisions of our income tax code, then we increase its complexity.  Of course, that is not by any means a final argument against amendments of this character.  It may well be desirable even to increase the complexity of the income tax code in order to serve the purpose of improvements, but we should not lose sight of this fact, that if the matter were to be done it could not be done really by a simple section such as this.  A number of supplementary provisions would be required and a very considerable new element of complexity would be introduced. 
       I oppose this amendment, however, on the ground that it is not the best or the most economic way to encourage industry.  I believe that in so far as the State can encourage industry the other methods that are in use are better, and if we are to do more it should be by extending our efforts along these other lines, including protection in suitable cases, and even subsidies in suitable cases, and assistance such as is given and is of appreciable value in some instances through the medium of technical instruction. 
     
     
        If we look at number 3 we will see that this particular relief would have to be given in respect of all manufacturing undertakings.  I do not see how we can very well say that in the case of undertakings where there is plenty of capital this should not apply.  It has been estimated if this section were passed that in the case of Guinness shareholders alone there would be a loss of £30,000, which probably would be more with the correction that Deputy MacEntee has inserted. No useful purpose at all would be served there.  There is a concern where the want of capital is not a consideration at all.  We would simply lose £30,000 for nothing.  I could mention other industries where a considerable loss would be involved and no direct benefit given. As a matter of fact, the greatest part of the loss of revenue would really be in relation to the industries which are fully capitalised and which if they require any further capital for development can get it. 
     The proposal also has this disadvantage, that it gives no relief naturally to the exempt taxpayer. It gives comparatively little advantage to the smaller taxpayer, and the weight of the loss to the Exchequer would go to taxpayers who are comparatively well off.  In addition to Guinness, I might mention a concern like the Imperial Tobacco Company.  I do not know that it would be suggested that this should not apply if the company which owned an industrial undertaking were registered outside.  In any case I suppose if a substantial thing like this were given in suitable cases and not in the cases like the Imperial Tobacco Company all the technical steps necessary would be taken to have the industry regarded as being established here. 
     Amendment 3 deals with the case of the private individual. On a matter of detail, it must be unreasonable that the amount of the deduction should be limited to £200 in the case of the individual, where it might really be in the nature of earned income, and   should be unlimited in the case of a shareholder of a company.  In any case the difficulty of administering it in the case of a private individual carrying on business would be very great.  It would arise, for instance, out of a mixed business.  It is difficult enough for, say, the grocer who owns a bakery to present returns dealing with the business taken as a whole.  If we were to have the sort of segregation that would be necessary in one of these mixed businesses, lots of difficulties would arise.  If you apply it to the whole business, so long as it is actually one business on the one spot singly managed, then you might have lots of people starting some very small manufacturing end.  The same sort of difficulty would apply even in the other case.  I am taking the extremes of the scale, but the real difficulty would arise in the middle of it.  Take the extremes. You have a furniture manufacturer. In one case a person gets the timber in an unworked state and he produces the furniture.  The timber is sawn and made into furniture ready for sale.  There is a case in this country of, I think, a private firm where furniture is imported and simply french-polished.  The french polisher, I presume, would describe his firm as a manufacturing undertaking. There would be all sorts of borderline cases and great difficulties would occur in the working of the scheme.  But I oppose it really on the grounds that this is not the best way to promote industry.  I do not think, as a matter of fact, that the question of the return that it is possible to receive on money invested in industries in Ireland has been the great difficulty.  The difficulty, I think, has been the belief that no return whatever would be received.  The lack of confidence that there is in the country is not so much the lack of confidence that only five per cent. would be obtained, where seven per cent. or eight per cent. would be received outside, but the fear of the failure of the business.  I believe that this particular type of provision, if   passed, would involve very substantial losses to the revenue, and the revenue would have losses in cases where no benefit at all would come to the community by way of stimulating industry as a result of the losses. 
     
      
       The Minister has two arguments against this.  One is that the amendment itself is too broad, and the second is that there are difficulties in so far as the onus of proof is to be placed on a beneficiary.  I do not see that that need worry the Minister.  The man who wants an exemption is the man to take the trouble to provide the facts to prove the case, and I think he will go to that amount of trouble.  It is too broad; it includes Guinness's brewery, the banks and various other activities of that kind.  I agree that that is the difficulty, unless one can reach the stage of getting rid of these misbelieving black hordes of harpies that gather around the income tax collection. There has always got to be a gradual method of approach.  It is merely a question of how we are going to approach it.  If the Minister's objection is that this thing is covering too much ground the Minister himself could suggest lines and categories in which that could be reduced in the initial stages.  For instance, when we were dealing with the no income tax campaign previously, certain of the banks definitely stated that while they were in favour of and would advocate that principle they themselves were prepared to stand out of the benefit of it.  It would be quite possible to leave out breweries and certain activities of that kind, in other words, to proceed by exemption.  You simply leave the Act as it is, and you amend Deputy MacEntee's motion to read &ldquo;certain kinds of manufacturing undertakings, and certain kinds of investments,&rdquo; until we gradually find by experience what we can include and what we can exclude. 
     
     The Minister, apparently, objects to using taxation for the purpose of policy.  He ought not to.  He only does   it momentarily when he is reminded of it.  He did not object to it when he declared, in relation to the £100,000 tax on buses, that it was part of a policy which he has never since disclosed, and does not intend, apparently, to disclose.  There is nothing which is more commonly used for the purpose of policy than taxation.  Nearly every critical change in legislation&mdash;I mean things that are fundamental&mdash;has been done in the form of taxation proposals. The Minister knows that perfectly well, and why the income tax code, of all codes, should be regarded as sacrosanct, I am hanged if I know. 
     There is supposed to be £200,000,000 of Irish capital lying idle in England. What I would like people to understand quite clearly is what that means.  We never sent over £200,000,000.  We never invested £200,000,000.  We sent over some hundreds of thousands of cows, some hundreds of thousands of eggs and firkins of butter for which we never took payment.  That is what we have invested.  We have invested £200,000,000 worth of agricultural produce in the industries of another country, and the price of that might very well and very wisely be actively encouraged to come back.  If the Minister knew the sort of feeling that the average person would have if he could say: &ldquo;From this day on I will never see or hear the name of income tax,&rdquo; if he could produce that condition in this country&mdash;the mere thought of being clear of all the trouble and annoyance of that system&mdash;he would be surprised at the amount of inducement it would give. 
     I do believe, without any doubt whatever, that if there could be an active and open discrimination in income tax, say in relation to Irish industries, there would be a very definite advance.  This is not one of the arguments that comes under the Minister's &ldquo;You cannot get blood out of a stone.&rdquo;  Frankly, I have no answer to that argument at the present moment. There is no blood in a stone, but we have the assurance in relation to the things which we do want that when it comes to another object and there is a surplus, whether the Minister   is introducing it from that direction or opposing from this, these are proposals which we do not proceed with, because there is no blood in a stone will have the support of the two large Parties of this House &mdash;of the Government, its successors and its predecessors. 
     If the Minister will recognise that quite apart from the amount of money involved, income tax is, of itself, regarded without any particular love or affection; that it is one of the things that people do not like, and that, if it were removed, it would make the country one to which people would be anxious to come, I think possibly that he will regard the instrument of income taxation as a policy machine of infinitely more power than he now does.  I am perfectly sure that he has no conception, because he has no basis of experience on which to base that conception, as to the degree to which the present administration of income tax law and its amount are hampering the development of Irish industry.  If he had that knowledge he would appreciate the extent to which alleviation could be brought about for the good of the country. 
     
      
       Knowing the conservative attitude of the mind of the Minister for Finance, I would like to ask him whether he would not consider even diminishing the actual application of that principle, first of all in establishing it.  It would be of immense benefit to the country if we could get agreement on the application of that principle first of all in regard to the need for capital for Irish industry, and, secondly, to the need for using Irish money for developing industry.  Perhaps the Minister would confine the principle to giving certain privileges, say, to banks which invest money outside the country on their undertaking to invest money in industries in this country.  We have not a complete set of figures, but I do not see why there should not be some way in which we could get the amount of the investments belonging to Irish investors in stocks and shares outside the country through the Stock   Exchange on the one hand and, on the other hand, the amount of money invested in foreign securities, such as bills of exchange by the banks.  At least, it would be some advance towards the assertion of the principle if we could get the full facts. I submit that in dealing with incometax the Revenue Department ought to be able to supply us with a considerable amount of data.  I would ask the Minister if he would be prepared, even in a detailed way, to admit the principle as being valuable. 
     
     
      
       I could not give the undertaking that Deputy Little asked for, and that Deputy Flinn pressed for.  We do not think that this principle of giving special concessions in relation to income tax on income derived from manufacturing industry here is necessary, or that it is a good principle.  We believe, in so far as revenue must be sacrificed or assistance given by the State, that the other ways by which assistance is already given are better and that anything more that needs to be done ought to be done along those lines. In reply to what Deputy Flinn has said, I do not take the line that income tax should not be used for policy, but I was trying to point out its complexity from the point of view of the taxpayer, and that, in so far as we try to use it for policy, we are likely to complicate it.  We cannot achieve a purpose such as Deputy MacEntee aims at through income tax and at the same time simplify it. It may be necessary to abandon simplification.  I think that we must abandon it if we try to do a number of things by means of income tax. 
     
     I do not base my opposition on the ground of complexity, although I draw attention to it.  I do it in the belief that this is not the best way in which the State can put forward whatever efforts it is able to make towards increasing manufacturing industry in this country.  I believe that this thing would cause grave dissatisfaction, that people not specifically engaged in manufacturing industry but engaged in useful business   and giving perhaps as much employment, would have a considerable grievance, and that whatever harm this system may do, such harm would be increased.  I believe also that the dissatisfaction amongst people who can live either in or out of the country as they like, and who bring considerable sums into the country, would be greatly increased, and, possibly, there might be some loss of revenue owing to the fact that they might leave.  That, again, is rather a minor point.  The main argument I have against it is that the methods of tariff or subsidy or assistance, education, or even assistance by finance along any lines that may be found practicable to substitute for the Trade Loans Guarantee Act, are ways on which we proceed, and that this method of differentiation in income tax is not the right one. 
     
      
       In reply to one or two points which the Minister made, like Deputy Little and Deputy Flinn, I wish to say that this amendment is not in any way meant to be final.  We did not propose to put down all the amendments and consequential amendments which would be necessary if the Minister for Finance were to adopt the principle.  We felt that those could properly be introduced on the Report Stage.  We put down this amendment so as to have the principle involved discussed.  Nor do we argue that this is necessarily the best way of encouraging industry, but we hold that it is one way.  It is the way the Minister himself has already applied.  I think, in the present Finance Bill in relation to debentures, stocks and certificates chargeable by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  He has discriminated in favour of stock of that company.  He has found it necessary to do so in the case of that company, which proposes to finance one industry to render it more attractive than the stock of other concerns not operating inside the Saorstat. 
     
     While we do not argue that the principle which we have embodied in this amendment is the best way to help industry, we believe that one of the ways industry could best be   helped would be to take as little as possible out of production to lighten the general taxation on the producer. We say that comparing it with the other ways which the Minister has suggested, as compared with the tariff or a subsidy, this way is possibly a better way.  I am not prepared to argue the question at length.  We all know that one of the indirect effects of a tariff or a subsidy is that it secures the home market upon more favourable terms for the home manufacturer than for his competitors.  Because he has a sense of security in regard to the home markets he is content perhaps to rest on his oars and to take the benefits swept to him by the tide.  In this way if there is going to be any benefit to the taxpayer or the manufacturer, he has to secure it by his own exertions. 
     There is just a possibility that one could argue that the way to help Irish industry proposed in the amendment, as compared with the ways which the Minister has mentioned, is the better way.  I do not want to argue that point, but we feel, whether this is the best way or not, that it is one of the ways which should be seriously considered by the House, because the fact remains that while there is a very considerable amount of Irish capital invested abroad, Irish concerns do find considerable difficulty in securing the capital necessary for their purposes.  Even when issues of stock are made under the auspices of the Government, backed by a Government guarantee on very attractive terms, they do not appear to be sufficiently attractive in themselves to induce the Irish investor to invest in them. 
     In regard to the point which the Minister made as to the difference between amendments 3 and 4, he argued that there seemed to be an unfair discrimination between a man who earns his income, whose income arises directly from profits of any manufacturing undertaking in the Saorstat, and the man who derives his income from investments in the Saorstat.  I think that is quite justifiable, because a man who derives his income from investments has a much   wider freedom of choice.  He can invest his money in Ireland or abroad, but the man who gets his income from a manufacturing undertaking here is practically tied to the spot. For that reason we feel that such a large inducement is not necessary to get him to continue the development of his business in the Saorstat as might be required in the case of a person who is free to invest his income here in the Saorstat, in Great Britain, or elsewhere in the world. 
     There is one other point to which I would like to refer.  The Minister said, in the course of his reply, that possibly in order to secure the benefits of the principle we have embodied in amendment 4, a person carrying on a multiple business might start small manufacturing undertakings.  We say, well and good.  That is the purpose of the amendment&mdash;to get him to start small undertakings, to get him to take the plunge and to make things in Ireland rather than to distribute them.  That is precisely the point. If a man does start a small manufacturing undertaking he will only do so because he is satisfied that on the balance it is going to be advantageous for him to start it.  It is going to spur that man on to an enterprise which otherwise he would not undertake.  In the Saorstat there are a number of large concerns which have been acting merely as distributors and not as manufacturers.  If our amendment succeeds in getting these people to turn their attention to the manufacturing branch of industry, the amendment will be justified.  There would be a large amount of competition between them which would have the effect of reducing prices and costs, and I believe that ultimately there would be a fairly substantial manufacturing interest in the country. 
     In regard to administrative difficulties, the whole income tax law bristles with them.  I know there are border line cases.  The whole thing turns on the point: Is the principle a sound one?  If it is a sound one, the administrative difficulties   and the cost involved are not any greater than the cost of principles already enshrined in the income tax laws.  Every discrimination, whether relief in respect of children or earned income, was carried in face of some difficulty, and they have all been met.  I agree that it makes for complexity, but if at the same time complexity can be justified by the results, we are not justified in rejecting an amendment on the ground that it would involve complexities.  We think that the principle is sufficiently sound to carry the amendments, and for that reason we could not in justice withdraw them. 
     
      
       I would like to make one other point, in relation to another effect of income tax discrimination, over and above the effect of any other tax that I know of.  At the present moment the Minister is banking on tariffs as practically his one method of dealing with these matters.  He has other methods, but that is broadly his line of country. The difficulty we have with tariffs in such circumstances as we find ourselves, is that the tendency of tariffed industries to change their ownership has actually been increased by the tariffs.  If the Minister will go through things statistically he will find that there is a very real difficulty.  Those who want to look at tariffs fairly are bound frankly to admit that fact&mdash;that it intensifies the trend towards expropriation of industries.  I know two cases&mdash;the Minister probably knows them as well as I do&mdash;of an industry which was applying for a tariff in this country when an Irish manufacturer in that industry got into contact with those who were applying for the tariff and pointed out to them the actual circumstances of that industry in relation to competitors who were not then operating in the Free State.  Simply on the grounds of prudence, until they could find some other means of protecting themselves against the dangers that that application for a tariff would have brought on them, they did not go forward with their application.  It   is only fair that those things should be said, and said openly, by those who are advocating tariffs. 
       In this income tax discrimination, we have the only weapon that I know of which can be used for the protection of Irish capital as distinct from the protection of Irish income.  If, for instance, the whole of the income tax upon an Irish manufacturing industry were remitted, the shares in any Irish manufacturing industry would be more valuable to an Irish resident than a foreign resident by the capitalised value of that income, and the whole tendency would be that Irish-owned industries in this country would, to the extent of the discriminating relief, remain in Irish hands, and non-Irish-owned manufacturing undertaking in this country, to the extent to which that discrimination was allowed, would tend to pass into Irish hands.  That, to me, is the biggest argument in favour of income tax discrimination, and if the Executive Council are not prepared to use this particular means of protecting Irish industry from the expropriation of ownership, a danger which I see growing, a danger which the Minister has experienced and which has been effective in the last few years, they must either be prepared to risk the continuation of that movement or to find some alternative means of dealing with it. 
     
     I, personally, have investigated, over a period of years, various possible ways of dealing with that difficulty. While you can, for France, England, Poland or Germany, whose training has been different, whose surroundings are different, whose internal control is different, formulate a lot of ingenious schemes, which have been very largely effective in these countries in preventing that expropriation of the ownership of means of production in this country up to the present, frankly I have not been able to find a method which is workable. This method, in my opinion, to the extent to which it would be used, would be effective.  But I am very anxious to encourage the Ministery to investigate, formulate and put before the House for sympathetic   consideration and examination any alternative means they have of dealing with that tendency.  They have got to recognise that the tendency exists, and they ought to recognise that in these amendments the principle of the method of dealing with that difficulty is laid down. 
     
      
       On the question which Deputy Flinn has last dealt with, the point of view of the Government is not entirely, I think, that put forward by Deputy Flinn.  We do not see great objection to the coming in of British companies here, though we recognise that there are many cases in which it would be much more desirable to have home companies owning the industry.  We do recognise also that if the process by which concerns founded here by Irish companies are being taken over by English companies were to continue to anything like the extent that it has been going on for the past year or two, steps will be necessary to deal   with it.  I agree, and perhaps the Government agrees, with Deputy Flinn, at any rate to this extent, that while the existence of even a considerable number of concerns owned by English companies here would be no particular harm, there are limits beyond which it would be extremely bad for the country that that process should go, and while not having reached a decision that it is yet necessary to take steps to check the acquisition of industry here by outside companies, we have been exploring two or three tax proposals to meet that matter.  One of them was a certain rearrangement and modification of the Corporation Profits Tax, and there were others.  I do not want to discuss it beyond saying that when we have come to the conclusion that we should take action to prevent concerns here falling into the hands of outside firms, we will take it along somewhat different lines from those indicated by Deputy Flinn.

     Amendment declared lost. 
     Amendment 4 not moved. 
     
      
       I move amendment 5:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (3) to add in line 27 the words: &ldquo;provided that in the case of a manufacturing undertaking any undistributed gains or profits arising out of such undertaking and employed to the satisfaction of the revenue authorities in extending premises or in installing new plant shall be exempt from tax, while so undistributed.&rdquo; 
       I suppose the Minister for Finance is not the only man who has been shocked at being suddenly presented with his own child.  As far as I know this amendment is in the words of the Minister for Finance himself, undistributed profits are to be taken as &ldquo;profits arising out of such undertaking and employed to the satisfaction of the revenue authorities in extending premises or installing new plant&rdquo; and such revenue shall be exempt from tax. On the occasion of the last Budget, when we put forward proposals for discrimination in relation to income tax, the Minister for Finance said that he himself had investigated one line in which that could be done, and that line was one which, in his opinion, was without apparent defects.  He said it would not cost much, that it probably would be effective, and that it seemed to be the most reasonable way in which the matter could be approached. Our answer to that was that we were not concerned as to the manner in which the principle was enshrined in legislation so long as it was so enshrined in legislation and accepted.  The Minister promised to consider very carefully between that Budget and this Budget the form apparently in which this proposal which is now offered to him with another formula would be accepted.  This is one of the amendments that does not come under the description, &ldquo;You cannot get blood out of a stone,&rdquo; because this amendment does intend to produce income. 
     
     If this money does go back and if means are used to encourage people to put their money into the development, the building up, and the improvement of the efficiency of their industrial and manufacturing plants, the income tax which will be got from such investments in any particular year ought to be equal to what the Minister would lose as a   capital sum, even assuming that he loses it altogether. 
     One of the difficulties in connection with this method is that it might be said that a man would keep putting the whole income which he did not want to use otherwise back in undistributed profits, and that then he would be able to sell those reserved included in his business and, therefore, to sell that income clear of income tax.  For the purpose of getting over that difficulty we have defined it, in the words of the Minister himself, as profits employed to the satisfaction of the revenue authorities, in extending premises or installing new plant.  I do not want to speak at any further length on this matter. I feel it would be painting the lily or gilding refined gold to attempt to recommend to the Minister for Finance an amendment which he himself has drafted and a proposal which he himself has picked out of all the possible proposals of income tax discrimination as the one which he would advocate and with which he could find no fault or blemish. 
     
      
       As I said last year, the proposal embodied in this amendment is one which has been a good deal advocated by writers on income tax, and, as I said also, it is one which seems to me to be suitable in the circumstances that exist here.  It would be easier to administer than many other proposals that have been made, and the money which would be lost to the revenue without corresponding profit to the community would be less.  But it is a proposal which needs some more examination than it has yet got.  It is a proposal which involves some difficulties in administration&mdash;indeed all these proposals do&mdash;and it is one which could not be legalised by a single section such as this.  There would have to be clauses containing quite a number of provisions.  It is a proposal to which I will give further examination during the coming year with the view, if a satisfactory scheme can be produced, of recommending it to the House.  I know there are   objections to it; I know that difficulties would be created, but I am not convinced that those difficulties would be by any means insuperable. However, I could not accept the amendment even if the matter had already been fully examined, because, in dealing with any income tax proposal, a very careful examination of the code and of the drafting is necessary in order to make it workable and in order to ensure that results do not ensue different from those which are intended.  I intend to have the idea that is involved here further examined as being one which I believe, on the whole, to be suitable for our circumstances. 
     
     
      
       I rise to correct a misapprehension which something the Minister said may possibly have laid the House under.  In dealing with the amendment he used the phrase &ldquo;lost to the revenue&rdquo;&mdash; money which would be lost to the revenue.  One of the advantages of this amendment is that any revenue which the Exchequer might temporarily have to forego is not permanently lost in any way.  It is only, as it were, lent to the original income tax payer to enable him to utilise it reproductively.  Of course, one of the advantages of the amendment is that it would be reproductive not only from the point of view of the income tax payer, but also from the point of view of the revenue itself.  It would be a source of wealth.  It is more or less in the nature of a revenue investment and, therefore, in considering it we should not come down to the basis that if we do carry this amendment the revenue is going to lose so much. It is going temporarily to forego certain income for the year, but that income is going to be invested, and if, as we believe, the investment will be a profitable one, the revenue is going to derive advantage from it year by year just the same as the income taxpayer who has secured the remission. 
     
     
      
       I think that is a somewhat rosy view of it.  In certain cases, the matter might work out as the Deputy suggests, but there would certainly be other cases in   which the effect of this would be to enable individuals to spend more on their personal enjoyment and still do the things that they wanted to do. 
     
     
      
       Does not the amendment specifically segregate it&mdash;&ldquo;to be used for extending premises and installing new plant&rdquo;?  The Minister accepted that last year.  He has had a whole year to meditate on it, and he tells us he is to spend another year meditating on it.  Perhaps he will not have that amount of time. If he has the time, he will spend another year meditating on it.  When will he do it?  This year?  Next year?  Sometime?  Never?  A Kathleen Mavourneen Minister for Finance! I do not think the interests of this country can afford a Kathleen Mavourneen Minister as Minister for Finance.  It is time the Minister woke up to do something instead of saying what he was going to do next year.  He cannot put forward in this particular case the argument put forward in relation to every other amendment the principle of which he was prepared to accept.  Therefore, he has got to get another.  He has not the time!  He told us at the opening to-day that there are £100,000 that he has not got and that he has not provided for and that that must be provided for. Because he cannot find other money, then he has got to turn down this   proposal.  And he is turning down this proposal because he has been too lazy to investigate the case and to put up consequential amendments to this.  That is a thing which if he wanted to do he could undoubtedly do between this and the Report Stage.  Next year!  If he is here next year he will tell us that he is thoroughly in favour of this amendment and that he thinks it will not lose any revenue, but that he will have to think about it again.  Some year, some time, if the House is patient enough to wait on him, he will carry into law the things which he says are desirable.  We had a clear declaration from the Minister last year, quite as clear as we have had to-day, that the year which has intervened would be used for translating into practical legislation the thing which he now says in another year he may be able to translate into practical legislation.  There was some validity in the excuse which he had made for the previous amendment which he has turned down.  But there is no excuse which is creditable to the Minister or to his staff or is respectful to the House for the reasons now given for not being in a position to put into legislation what he thinks himself ought to be put into legislation and what he led the House to believe last year would now be put into legislation.

     Amendment declared lost. 
     Sections 1 and 2 agreed to. 
     SECTION 3. 
     
      
       Section 3 is really identical with the existing legislation, except that the assessments have no longer to be signed by the special commissioners.  As I explained, we had this signing in the case of Schedules A and B.  Signing and allowing in the case of other schedules have been the merest formality.  There are something like 600,000 assessments, and it merely meant that a batch of books was signed by the special commissioner. 
       Section 3 agreed to. 
       SECTION 4. 
     
     
      
       Section 4 is for the same purpose. 
       Section 4 agreed to. 
       SECTION 5. 
     
     
      
       Section 5 carries out one or two amendments which, I think, will be convenient.  It enables, for instance, the inspector to amend an assessment by agreement with the taxpayer and the appeal is then taken as being withdrawn.  At present, if there is agreement with the taxpayer the appeal has nominally to go before the special commissioners. In sub-section (5), Section 5, there is one other change.  It is provided that the hearing may be by one special commissioner.  At present, as I explained already, hearings take place before two special commissioners. The effect of that is that inconvenience is caused at the beginning of a circuit because inspectors have not sufficient time to have correspondence with taxpayers which might lead to adjustment of differences, and at the end of the circuit because the commencing of collections was   delayed and the circuit lasts too long.  The system of having appeals heard by two special commissioners was taken over from Great Britain. In Great Britain, however, the circumstances are quite different. There is no inconvenience in the system of hearing by two commissioners there, because there are local commissioners, and moreover, there is no appeal from the special commissioners, whereas here there is an appeal to the Circuit Court Judge on all matters of fact, with, of course, the usual appeal to the High Court on a matter of law.  In certain matters in regard to which the decision of the special commissioners is final, applications for certain reliefs, the hearings will still be by two special commissioners.  The hearing by one is confined to appeals against assessments, in which case there is the further appeal to the Circuit Judge. 
       Deputy Law raised a point the last day about one of the special commissioners. As a matter of fact, that special commissioner has been for a considerable time permanent in the post which he occupies. 
       Section 5 agreed to. 
       SECTION 6. 
     
     
      
       Section 6 is carrying out the same idea.  It allows the granting of reliefs by the inspector. As a matter of fact, what happens at present is they are allowed in the assessment, and they are supposed to be allowed by the special commissioner who signs and allows the assessment.  It is simply carrying out the idea of having no longer the troublesome formality of books of assessment being signed and allowed by the special commissioners. 
       Section 6 agreed to. 
       SECTION 7. 
     
     
      
       Section 7 is necessary because there is a provision, for instance, for the adoption of the basis for the preceding year.  At present persons have to make returns based on the amount of profits and gains on the fair or just average of three preceding years, and so on.  That will   go, and it is necessary to have this. 
       Section 7 agreed to. 
       SECTION 8. 
     
     
      
       Section 8 provides for the transfer of certain profits from Schedule A to Schedule D.  At present mines, quarries, railways, gas works, waterworks, canals, ferries, fishings and various markets are chargeable under Schedule A on the annual value computed by reference to profits.  The present state of the law is obscure in several respects. They are chargeable under Schedule A, according to the rules of Schedule D, and it is simply proposed that these matters be transferred definitely to Schedule D, which will remove certain complexities that exist at present. 
       Section 8 agreed to. 
       SECTION 9. 
     
     
      
       Section 9, with the two sections which follow, brings into operation the change from the basis of the average of three years to the preceding year.  In addition, it makes provision that at the beginning, in the first year of the assessment, under the change, in the case of a new business, the assessment shall be on the profits of the period. Then if it were started as is indicated in the section, during that year, in the next year it will be charged on the basis of the first twelve months working along the actual profits of the second period. 
       
         An Ceann Comhairle  took the Chair. 
     
     
      
       As this section and some of the other sections are consequential upon the new basis of assessment which the Minister proposes to adopt, we do not really intend to oppose them.  There is a good deal to be said on both sides. We feel that on the whole possibly the advantage will be to the Exchequer. We believe it is going to be so, because the Minister, according to his own statements, believes that we are passing through the lowest point of the economic and business   depression which has visited this country, and that consequently two of the worst years are going to be dropped out of the calculation for the purpose of computing an average income over these three years. For the first year or so possibly the income taxpayers may be paying on a higher basis of assessment than hitherto.  Of course, one could argue that it might be better to have delayed making the change until things were better in this country. But as the change must eventually be made, we are not disposed to oppose it simply on the point of time. 
     
     
      
       I think there will be comparatively little difference to the taxpayer because the change will always be by way of improvement and, consequently, it will be effected with less of a jolt now than it could be done at any other time. 
       Section 9 agreed to. 
       SECTION 10. 
     
     
      
       Section 10 is consequential. It will avoid certain difficulties in connection with assessment where investments are changed.  All invested incomes will be regarded as issuing from a single source and the assessment will be made on the basis of the income in the preceding year.  The difficulties of a change from British War Loan to National Loan or from American Railway Shares to National Loan or anything of that sort will be avoided.  There will not be separate assessments in respect of these different classes of income. There will be one investment income assessment. 
       Sections 10 and 11 agreed to. 
       SECTION 12. 
     
     
      
       Section 12 deals with the discontinuance of trades.  We have a provision here corresponding to the provision with regard to the commencement of a business.  If the business is commenced in the middle of a year, the assessment will be on the actual profits for that part   of the income tax year.  Then on the next year the taxpayer is entitled to have his profits assessed on the actual profits of the second year. Here it is provided where a trade is discontinued during a year, it takes in the profits of that part of the year which is passed and then the revenue will have the right to go back and tax the last complete year on the basis of the profits actually earned.  The reason for that is to prevent a formal and fictitious discontinuance of business after a year when it may have made abnormal profits and is re-established under another name. 
       Sections 12 and 13 agreed to. 
       SECTION 14. 
     
     
      
       Section 14 has reference to the case where there is a change in partnership.  If a partnership is only partially changed, if one partner remains in business and another comes in, then it may be charged normally as a continuing business; but if all the people concerned agree to go out of the business it can be treated as a business which has been discontinued and recommenced.  Where there is a complete change of proprietorship, it is regarded as a winding-up of the business and the starting of a new one.  The provision in regard to losses is really parallel to the existing provisions. 
       Section 14 agreed to. 
       SECTIONS 15-20. 
     
     
      
       How many of these sections deal with a particular matter? 
     
     
      
       All the sections up to 20. 
     
     
      
       If we take 15 to 20, inclusive, and let the Minister make a statement on them, perhaps it would meet the case. 
     
     
      
       That would be better.  It might be no harm if the Minister, in his statement, would go back and point out how persons   may secure a refund in respect of losses.  It would be well to have that cleared up. 
     
     
      
       On the question of losses, I think that the new arrangement is, on the whole, more satisfactory and should be more favourable to the taxpayer than the old one.  If losses occurred under the old arrangement, they were taken into account in the computation of the three years' average.  Now it is proposed to allow losses to be carried over a period of six years and to be set against the profits that may be made in the first or all of these six years, if necessary.  This particular section is, of course, parallel to the section which was adopted in Great Britain when the change was made there.  It is proposed, for instance, under Section 16 and, I think, under Section 15 also, that where accounts are presented for broken periods the average shall be based on twelve months.  For instance, in the past, where accounts for eighteen months and accounts for six months had been presented in order to obtain the amount for the year, we might have had to add the six months' profits to the eighteen months and their total divided by two.  Under the new arrangement, part of the eighteen months &mdash; say six months &mdash; that would fall within the period will be taken and one-third will be added to the profits shown in the six months' accounts, so that the average, following the general principle, will not be over any greater period than one year. 
     
     There is a change in the basis of Schedule E assessments in the same way as in regard to other assessments. It will be put on the basis of the preceding year, and there are certain minor modifications in regard to double residence.  There is also provision postponing Part 2 of the Bill until the year 1930-31.  The effect of all these changes is to make a very definite move in the direction of simplification.  It is only a comparatively small step in that direction, but it will be of appreciable value to some people.  So far as the taxpayer   is concerned, the new arrangement, in view of the times in which the change is being made, will affect them very little.  In so far as arrangements are made for setting off all losses, I think the new arrangement is rather more favourable than the old.  There is no interference with the present position except an interference which is consequential on the change from the three years average, or whatever other basis existed up to the present.  In the case of British dividends accruing to persons resident only in the Saorstat since 1926, they have been chargeable on the basis of income arising in the year of assessment, and a great deal of trouble arose from that because estimated assessments had to be made in virtually all such cases, and there was the question of an endeavour to get payment on account, and, at the end of the year, to make either additional or reduced assessments.  Under the new arrangement that will be got rid of entirely. 
     Sections 15 to 20, inclusive, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
     
      
       Section 21 continues the duties that have, with certain others, been called the MacKenna duties. 
       Section 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
     
     
      
       The next section, 22, continues the dried fruit duties.  The original duties have been in force since 1876. 
       Ordered that Section 22 stand part of the Bill. 
       SECTION 23. 
     
     
      
       I move the following amendment:&mdash; 
       Before Section 23 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;The duties of Excise chargeable on tobacco grown in Saorstat Eireann under Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1918, shall cease to be chargeable or leviable as on and from the First day of January, 1930, and no duty of Excise shall be chargeable or leviable on tobacco grown in Saorstat Eireann which is sold or kept for sale in Saorstat Eireann as on and from that date.&rdquo; 
     
     
        I would like before moving this amendment to say that it would be a good thing if the House agreed to a free vote.  That is one privilege I ask for and the other is that the Ceann Comhairle would give as much licence as he may think it is possible for him to give during the discussion on this question.  I know very well that the Minister for Finance and others will consider that this is a very big question.  I am aware that something approaching three and a half million pounds in revenue is obtained from tobacco.  It is at present almost entirely on customs or imported tobacco that that revenue is obtained.  It is undoubtedly an extremely heavy tax, especially on the poorer class of people who are unfortunately the most numerous in the country.  Several attempts have been made to revive this industry.  We have had schemes and we have had subsidies and rebates of duty.  They have all failed but that is no reason why the industry itself should be a failure in Ireland.  There are times when industries are started, when cooperative organisations are started, times of big prices and perhaps times of abnormal prosperity when in reality it is not good for either cooperative organisations or industries to be started.  People are inclined at such times to take abnormal viewpoints, which afterwards have serious reactions when we get into a normal position.  A rehandling scheme was started in the tobacco industry which would undoubtedly have been successful &mdash; and which was, in fact, to a certain extent successful &mdash; but for the particular period of prosperity in which that occurred.  We find that tobacco was grown then in competition with other crops which had a guaranteed price, a price which was higher than that paid for tobacco. It was then an infant industry. 
     People had not a great deal of experience, and it was not quite so well understood as other crops, with the result that farmers naturally went in for crops which, at the moment, gave them the greatest returns.  In those particular times, those other crops gave that special return.  Afterwards,   when that scheme had fulfilled its time, a rebate of duty was given.  That rebate had very extraordinary effects, because the Minister for Finance, and perhaps the Minister for Agriculture, will at once multiply that amount of rebate by 800 pounds, which is supposed to be the produce of one acre of tobacco, and will tell us candidly that the farmer pocketed that amount.  That, of course, is not the case.  The farmer, under those conditions, pocketed no money whatever except what the manufacturers cared to pay him.  The manufacturer may have pocketed the rebate, so that that method was not a good one for reviving the industry. I have, in fact, heard a man who knows the industry pretty well say that if the intention really was to kill the industry, the proposal made to revive it would have effected that end.  Tobacco, unfortunately, from the time it was first introduced into this country, became a means to political ends, and at other times it actually entered into international politics.  Charles II. found that it was a good method for raising revenue, and he proceeded to prevent the growth of the crop in any of these islands, because he had the monopoly of colonially produced tobacco.  The only colony that produced tobacco was the United States. Of course, it was not the United States then.  We find, at a later period, that what is the United States now did not at all agree with the economic policy under which it had to live, so it decided to change things by force, and it did so.  The British Government, in order to intimidate that country to a certain extent, allowed tobacco to be grown in Ireland, but there was a proviso that it should not interfere with the commercial prosperity of England. The crop was grown most successfully here, and up to 1830, after 100 years experience, the crop was well and properly grown. 
     We had then begun to compete with the biggest tobacco producing country of the world, the United States.  We were then, according to statements made in the House of Commons, the only country capable   of competing in quality with the United States.  As it interfered with commercial interests in England and as London manufacturers found that Irish manufacturers were able to produce tobacco of superior quality and at greatly reduced prices, they at once took steps to crush the industry here.  We find that in that year, 1830, amongst many who lamented the industry from the point of view of the employment it gave and from the point of view of the cultural effect it had on the people of Ireland, especially the farming community, was the Royal Dublin Society.  They lamented the fact that unemployment would increase and they wondered at that time what would become of the people engaged in the industry. There were then thirty-two factories in Ireland and in County Wexford as much as a thousand acres of tobacco were grown.  Before the Union an Irish acre produced 15 cwt. of tobacco.  The producers got one and sixpence per pound and the Government of this country which then was the Parliament in College Green, in order to protect the industry, levied a duty of three shillings per pound on imported tobacco.  It is an undoubted fact that Ireland from the agricultural point of view was then in a most prosperous condition. That prosperous condition excited the jealousy of the British Government and they at once took steps to bring about the Act of Union.  I believe if we adopted to a certain extent the method then adopted to protect agricultural industries we would be successful. In moving this amendment, I am not asking for any subsidy or any rebate.  Neither am I asking the taxpayer to contribute any sum of money.  Therefore, I am in agreement with the Minister for Finance.  As long as we do not interfere with the revenue or ask the taxpayer for anything else, I am quite sure we agree. 
     Another point in connection with the industry is this: This amendment, if passed, will not come into force until January next.  In order to grow a crop of tobacco next year, it will be necessary to sow the seed in February and March.  The plants   will not be planted out until May and June, and the crop will not be harvested until September and October. The tobacco itself will not be ready for manufacturing for almost nine months or a year after that. Therefore, before anything at all could possibly happen to affect the revenue, two full years would have to elapse.  After the two full years have elapsed, and if on the second year the industry is revived and home-grown tobacco replaces any of the imported tobacco, there will be a small loss, perhaps, in revenue, but it will be very small, and, like most other industries, especially agricultural industries, we may take it that there will be no displacements of revenue of any kind for at least three full years.  If the then Minister for Finance finds that the displacement is very serious, he has his remedy.  He has succeeded in establishing an industry, which is a native industry, and which will undoubtedly be capable of producing some revenue.  The Minister for Finance will have made an investment, I hope not for himself, but for some Minister for Finance who may succeed him.  At any rate, I take it, it is the duty of the Minister for Finance to make such an investment.  As the amendment is not going to cost anything within the next two years that the country cannot stand, I do not see what objection the House should have to accepting it.  There are a few difficulties, as I said before, but the Revenue authorities, with their ability, will easily get over any difficulties that may arise. 
     There was one point that struck me.  I do not know much about revenue laws, but it struck me that certain trouble may arise in regard to stalks and wastes. As I understand the matter, on the imported article a certain rebate is given to manufacturers on what are called wastes and stalks.  If an industry were started under those conditions, I am quite sure that subsidiary industries, such as the manufacture of nicotine and other things, would also be started.  These would encourage the farmer to sell his stalks to the manufacturer in order that he might get a larger rebate.  I   am quite sure that the rebate could be easily settled on the question of averages.  The revenue authorities must have data sufficient to calculate what would be the average rebate on a ton of tobacco for the last three or four years.  That would not present any great difficulty. 
     There are no other difficulties that I see.  We have only adopted this system of taxation of tobacco because of habit.  I am quite sure the Minister will admit that he found it there, and found it very convenient and handy as there is not very much trouble in the collection of the tax.  But I believe that the time has arrived when we no longer can use handy methods and no longer can get money by any of these handy methods.  That is the reason that tobacco has been singled out as being a commodity that can be taxed indirectly with the greatest amount of convenience to the revenue authorities.  The present tax was a war tax.  It was a tax started when they multiplied £1 by two and got £3.  These conditions do not prevail to-day, but the tax is the same, so that it is bearing rather heavily on the people whose income is greatly impaired.  In those days people looked on tobacco as a luxury, but we have ceased to look on this industry as being anything in the nature of a luxury one. Tobacco is to-day to most of us a necessity and, therefore, that taxation habit should cease as far as possible. 
     It would be well in considering this to see what the world outside is doing.  We find that the British Government some years ago decided to encourage the growth of tobacco in their colonies, and they gave 2/- preference on the British market. If we had the plant grown here and had a free market we could avail of that 2/- in selling any surplus.  At present we cannot do that.  Several commissions were set up in Great Britain to inquire into this matter. The Imperial Economic Committee's reports are rather interesting reading, and they give very definite figures regarding the position of   tobacco-growing in the colonies. They tell us that in Nyasaland and in some of the South African colonies the industry is looked upon by the people as being their only hope from the agricultural point of view. But Nyasaland and some of the South African colonies do not seem to have the advantage of a free home market.  They have not the advantages that Canada and other countries have.  In order to give an example of what a home market really means to the industry, and what bearing it has on the prosperity or success of the industry, I may say that the following is the position, the figures given representing thousands of pounds.  You have India, probably one of the greatest tobacco-producing countries in the world, and also one of the greatest consumers.  Of every thousand lbs. grown in India, 970 lbs. are consumed in India and 30 lbs. exported.  Canada, which is more or less similar to this country in conditions, and to a certain extent in history, has a local production of 47.  She consumes 38 of that in her home market and exports 9.  The production of the Union of South Africa is 201⁄2.  They consume 11 and export 91⁄2, whereas Nyasaland and Southern and Northern Rhodesia export all that they produce. Their exports are: Nyasaland, 8 millions; Southern Rhodesia, 16; and Northern Rhodesia, 21⁄2.  There you have had the least development. The industry there gives the least employment because they have not any home market. 
     It may be said that we cannot smoke the tobacco grown in Ireland. In fact, people stated that it could never become a habit with the people.  We find, however, in South Africa something of the same conditions prevailed.  As the taste in smoking, like a good many other tastes, is simply an acquired one, we find that in all these countries price governs the taste, and that if a new commodity is introduced, like tobacco, and the manufacturer can get it at a reasonable price, and has a reasonable chance of continuity of supply, he will take that tobacco and   put it on the market and sell it, and it will be acceptable at once to the purchaser.  What happened in this country previously was that we never had either of these things.  We did not have the tobacco cheap, nor did we have any chance of continuity of supply.  As to South Africa, this is what the Committee stated on page 26: 
     &ldquo;In South Africa cigarettes made from imported American leaf have been practically ousted by those made from local growth. There is a parallel change in progress in the United States to-day, where cigarettes of blended tobaccos of Virginian and Turkish types are gaining ground at the expense of the purely American.&rdquo; 
     That is a matter of taste.  One of the arguments put up here has been that Irish tobacco would not be smokeable. We have it, however, on the authority of at least one of the managers of a very large firm here in Ireland that he is prepared to blend a very high percentage of Irish-grown leaf, and that it can actually be sold to the public without the public knowing that.  Of course, it is known in all countries that new seed introduced into a country is neutral.  The flavour of the plant is to a certain extent neutral for a number of years.  Until the seed gets a sort of naturalised and acclimatised it will not adopt any definite flavour.  Several experiments have been made here, but most of them were confined to one class of tobacco &mdash;the strong dark leaf, which grew without any trouble.  That is practically the usual class of weed&mdash; because tobacco is really a weed&mdash; which grows without any difficulty. There was no encouragement, and perhaps permission was not given, to grow the other, which is the most important leaf to-day&mdash;that is the cigarette leaf.  We find that in different counties plants of different qualities will grow.  Kilkenny produced a really good class of cigarette leaf, while we have to-day a really good cigar being produced in County Wexford. 
     
        That brings me back to the point as to why I asked that the duties and restrictions should be removed. There are certain conditions which at present the revenue authorities will exact from the tobacco grower and one of these conditions is actually in existence in the County Wexford. There we find that an individual who is growing tobacco even against these odds, in order to comply with the excise regulations was compelled to build his factory at least three miles away from where the tobacco was grown.  And he had to enter into very heavy bonds and at present such bonds are not easily obtainable.  The result of the Agricultural Credit Corporation operations is a proof of that.  People are timid in going security for individuals throughout the country for any purpose whatever. 
     These are some of the restrictions which I would like to see removed in order that the industry may have a fair chance and which will be gone into more deeply later on.  The present position of the tobacco industry is that the colonies which in the world production have an advantage of 2/- preference, have made great progress.  Of all the countries that have made progress in this direction Canada is the foremost and as I said a few moments ago Canada is a country that in climate and otherwise is most akin in conditions to those here.  I am aware that statements were made that tobacco is a tropical plant and that we might as well try to grow tea or sugar cane.  Of course I know these statements were made in a humorous way and that there was nothing serious about them. The person who made these statements did not mean them to be taken seriously because tobacco is grown all over the world.  We find the Canadian Government are taking very definite steps to still further encourage the production of the plant.  At the present time they are actually making a survey of land suitable for tobacco production, in order that that land may be earmarked for that purpose.  To say, therefore, that the industry would be of no importance would be completely   wrong.  The industry is one that employs a great number of people.  It is an industry which the small farmer can profitably engage in provided he gets these particular opportunities.  It is an industry into which the human element very largely enters.  The grading and handling of tobacco cannot be done by machinery.  It is an industry in which the chief work is done when other work cannot be done and one of the best parts of it is that in order to grow half an acre or an acre of tobacco you must have tilled at least four times as much as you grow in tobacco.  The crop is only a short time in the ground after which catch crops can be very successfully grown and one of the most successful catch crops that can be grown is wheat.  The land is perfectly clean.  I do not mean that wheat can be grown in big quantities but I mean that wheat can be grown for the purposes of the small farmer and for his own use.  That has been done previously and with great results and it can be done again.  It is with confidence that I ask the Dail to accept this amendment. 
     
      
       It has often been said that this little island of ours is a green isle.  I think if the House accepts this amendment it will be also said that we are a green people. I do not propose to go back to the days of Charles II. which the mover of the amendment did, but to deal with the question in more modern times about which we have more information than we have of the days in which King Charles lived.  I would like to deal with the question purely from the commercial point of view and purely from the point of whether the starting of the tobacco industry in Ireland is likely to be an asset to the State.  Now the nearer times to which I have referred have clearly demonstrated three things: the first is that the growing of tobacco in this country can only be accomplished at serious financial loss; the second is that even when we have a crop grown we are unable to dispose of it, and the third is that it will never be a revenue-producing   industry so far as this State is concerned. 
       I listened to Deputy O'Reilly dealing with Nyasaland and Rhodesia and various other remote countries, but I wondered why he did not deal with the actual facts, which he could easily have got, as they exist about tobacco-growing in this country.  He said that Irish-grown tobacco at reasonable prices would be bought by the tobacco manufacturers, completely ignoring the fact that the tobacco manufacturers here absolutely refuse to buy the tobacco and that portion of the crop is still unsold. We are asked to embark on tobacco-growing to-day entirely regardless of the fact that tobacco-growing has already cost the State something not less in amount than £100,000.  After we have already wasted £100,000 we are asked to-day to go further and waste more money. 
     
     The Committee set up to deal with this particular question of the growing of tobacco stated that to embark on the successful production of tobacco it would be necessary that the country should be involved approximately in a loss of about £116 for every acre of tobacco grown.  Paragraph 3 of the Report on home-grown tobacco states that this project has been tried for a period of 22 years up to 1923, that a bonus of 1/- per lb. was paid to growers, that this was changed later to a subsidy of £50 an acre, which was afterwards reduced to £25, and that this was provided for out of a special grant from the Development Fund amounting to about £70,000. And what was the net result of these subsidies?  There was a steady decline in the total acreage under tobacco, and we still hold that £140,000 worth of home-grown tobacco in bond which we are unable to sell.  The total acreage under tobacco was, in 1914, 2173⁄4 acres; in 1919, 761⁄2 acres; 1922, 511⁄4 acres; 1923, 331⁄4 acres; 1924, 201⁄2 acres and 1925, 153⁄4 acres; so that from 1914 to 1925 the total acreage declined from 217 acres to 153⁄4 acres.  It states in that Report that that decline in Irish tobacco-growing is due first to   the refusal of the Irish manufacturers to buy home-grown leaf at the lowest price which the growers can afford to accept, and that the operation of the Imperial preference of two shillings in the pound in Great Britain had resulted in flooding the market with the cheap Indian and Colonial leafs.  These are very important points which the mover of the amendment failed to deal with. They are difficulties which have got to be surmounted if the growing of tobacco as a profitable industry in this country has got to be embarked upon.  The Report states that at that moment the produce of several years' crop, amounting to 140,000 lbs., was retained in bond, for which there was no Irish market available and which could only be sold in Great Britain at a substantial loss to the grower. 
     I wonder why Deputy O'Reilly, who is by no means a fool in industrial matters, did not deal with these particular points so vital to the tobacco-growing industry as it is affected in this country.  I note here, in another portion of the report, they say: &ldquo;Assuming that home-grown tobacco would displace a corresponding amount of imported leaf, the additional loss to the revenue over and above the present rate of preference would be, approximately, £116 for every acre of tobacco grown and marketed.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Reilly, a practical farmer, asks the farmers of this country to embark on a proposition which involves the loss of £116 per acre.  Now, I know that this is a green isle, but we are not quite so green as to embark upon a wild-cat project like that.  The result of tobacco growing in this State has shown another very important thing; that is, if we continue to produce tobacco, it will have to surmount three barriers.  These three absolutely negative the possibility of growing tobacco in this country at a profit. The first of these is that the cost of production tends to increase.  The second is that the yield of tobacco tends to decrease, and the third is that the average selling price obtained tends to diminish.  I would   say, in the face of these actual results obtained in this country, that I cannot see how this House can be reasonably asked to entertain a proposition of this kind.  Deputy O'Reilly referred to various parts of the country in which tobacco was grown. 
     If the Deputy only consulted this Report he would find there a lesson that we must take to heart in considering this question.  In Louth the average yield per statute acre for tobacco in 1911 was 949 lbs.; in 1912 the average yield was 588 lbs.  The average price in 1911 was 5d. per lb., and in 1912 it was 2.7d. per lb.  The loss per statute acre in 1910 was £8 5s. 6d.; the loss per statute acre in 1911 was £19 7s. 6d., and the loss in 1912 was £20 10s. 3d.  So that the loss, as we went on and gained experience in the growing of tobacco in the Co. Louth, rose from £8 5s. 6d. in 1910 to £20 10s. 3d. in 1912. 
     The same thing may be found in Wexford.  In 1911 the yield in Wexford was 1,111 lbs. to the acre.  In 1912 that yield fell to 770 to the acre. The average price was 5d. and 2.7d. respectively for these two years.  I want you to get on to the net loss, and the net loss was, in 1909, £10 6s. 9d.; in 1910, £15 13s.; in 1911, £16 6s. 2d. and in 1919, £19 8s. 7d. Deputy O'Reilly is not satisfied that this State should cut its losses.  He wants us to go back again and pile on to this country in its present economic position further losses.  He told us that this was an admirable country in which to grow tobacco, a sort of ideal State, and he made suggestions that we would be justified not only in growing tobacco but in growing rice and other similar crops. I think there are more serious issues behind this matter than Deputy O'Reilly suggests.  In 1912, 39 of the 50 small growers had heavy deficits. Yet it was one of Deputy O'Reilly's points that this was an admirable crop for the small farmers, and the crop to be dealt with in the same way that small holders deal with such crops.  That was the result. There are only 11 cases where there were any sales to meet the charges. As to climatic suitability, I have only   to say that in that particular year the frost did considerable damage. Forty thousand lbs. of tobacco was produced; 8,554 lbs. was so damaged that it had to be sold at 2d. per lb., and 7,975 lbs. were completely destroyed.  Fancy having similar results in 1929 or 1931, to which Deputy O'Reilly refers.  Surely the Irish farmers have got sufficient sense to see that this proposition is wholly impracticable.  We have here 40,000 lbs. of a tobacco crop, of which one-fifth was useless, and one-fourth so damaged that it had to be sold at 2d. per lb.; there only remains about 23,000 lbs. of tobacco which one could call saleable tobacco, and the larger percentage of that tobacco was of a very inferior kind. 
     I am sure that this House will know that I have as much interest in the establishment of Irish industry as any individual here.  I would be as anxious that the tobacco industry would be established in this country, as genuinely and sincerely anxious as Deputy O'Reilly himself, provided he could show the House that this country could make money by the establishment of such an industry. The first great essential in production is that we are to produce something for which there is a demand &mdash; that we have to produce that article for which there is a market.  There is an economic law that nobody in this House can ignore, the law of supply and demand.  Deputy O'Reilly wants us to produce an article for which there is no demand in this country, and an article which, when we have it produced, is entirely unsaleable. We produced home-grown tobacco here, and when we had a subsidy of something like £50 an acre for home-grown tobacco in 7 different centres &mdash; and I would ask Deputy O'Reilly to take particular note of these figures &mdash; the cost of production was 10.2d. per lb.  The sale price was 4.3d.  The result was that 5.9d. per lb. was lost on every lb. of tobacco grown and marketed in this country. 
     Deputy O'Reilly further elaborated the point that there was no reasonable chance given to the production   of what he termed the lighter tobacco.  I find in the same invaluable report, which Deputy O'Reilly evidently did not consult, that the cost of production of cigarette tobacco in one centre was £40 5s. 8d. per acre, whilst £17 15s. 6d. was the amount received by the sales, so that on the production of light tobacco there was a loss of £22 10s. 2d. per acre. 
     If we turn to the heavier tobacco. Deputy O'Reilly led the House to believe that it could be grown very easily; in fact, it was something in the nature of a weed.  He said pipe tobacco was a very suitable product and it could be easily cultivated in this country.  Pipe tobacco was grown in five centres, the cost of production was £27 1s. 0d. per acre, and the amount received was £9 10s. 0d.  There was there a loss of £17 11s. 0d. per acre.  Let us look at this as a commercial proposition. We realise that pipe tobacco has proved a dead loss, despite a subsidy of £50 per acre.  Deputy O'Reilly is optimist enough to think that the mere removal of this duty is going to start a flourishing tobacco trade.  I do not know what wages the people engaged in the trade will get.  I do not know if the wages would be something like what is paid in remote countries and which amount to something like 2d. a day.  I would like to see Deputy Corry offering an Irish agricultural worker 2d. a day. 
     
      
       I would pay him better than you would pay for the shamrock shovel. 
     
     
      
       The shamrock shovel stood the test of this House and it has not been protected yet.  Evidently it did not appeal to that side of the House, and neither do the figures which I am giving now.  The result of these experiments has shown very clearly that from a practical point of view, from a commercial and profitable point of view, the growing of tobacco here is an absolute impossibility.  It cannot be grown here with profit.  That is a lesson we apparently have yet to learn.  We have already paid   £100,000 towards learning that lesson, and the sooner we digest the lesson the better.  I think it is nearly time we had the moral courage to face up to this matter and to admit that tobacco growing has been a complete failure.  There can be no financial return from tobacco grown here.  It cannot be recommended to Irish farmers as a crop that will give a single penny profit.  I see the Minister for Agriculture on the front bench.  I fancy he will agree with me when I say that the £30,000 referred to by Deputy O'Reilly could be much better expended on behalf of the Irish farmers if it were invested on the same lines as the £8,000 invested in the Live Stock Breeding Act.  If it were invested in some measure of that kind that the country sadly stands in need of, it would have more beneficial results. 
       I do not wish to say any harsh word of criticism about Deputy O'Reilly.  I do say, however, that he does not seem to have studied the question before he put down this amendment.  His proposal will not stand careful examination or any comparison with such figures as I have mentioned.  Already we have lost enough in an attempt to grow tobacco, and my advice to the House is to advise the farmer to leave tobacco-growing alone, and if he does so he will find himself in a much better position. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Byrne seems to have constituted himself as a judge on this important matter. There is nothing in the amendment which would permit him to constitute himself a judge of such a matter as tobacco-growing.  The object of the amendment is to allow the farmers of Ireland to be the judges. 
     
     
      
       I am willing to submit to the judgment of the House. 
     
     
      
       The amendment seeks to allow the farmers of the country to find out whether they can grow tobacco or not.  Deputy Byrne talked about a loss of   revenue.  There will be no loss of revenue, and it is quite obvious from his speech that the Deputy knows very little about the matter. 
     
     
      
       There are one or two aspects of this question that I would like to refer to.  Since Deputy Byrne made his contribution to the debate, I became very interested, and I hope that he will stay for a few moments so that I can put him a few questions. 
     
     
      
       There is somebody outside anxious to see me. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Byrne speaks of a loss of £116 per acre.  Who suffers that loss?  Does he mean the farmer who grows the tobacco? Does he actually lose £116 per acre or is it the State that loses that amount in revenue for every acre of tobacco that is grown? 
     
     
      
       I mean the State, the growers, and everybody involved.  If we start growing tobacco it is going to mean a loss of £116 per acre.  The apportionment of the loss is immaterial. The State will lose £116 per statute acre for tobacco grown here. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy says that the State loses £116. 
     
     
      
       I never made that statement.  What I said was that there was a loss of £116 on every acre.  The apportionment of that loss is another matter. 
     
     
      
       We have now a clear idea of Deputy Byrne's outlook as far as the country is concerned.  His point is that if you send £30 out of the country to bring in goods which will produce £116 in revenue for the State, that is a better proposition than to keep the £30 at home. 
     
     
      
       Do you want to ask me any other question before I go? 
     
     
      
       That is enough for you. 
     
     
      
       That is what Deputy Byrne is arguing all along &mdash; that a loss to State revenue is a loss to the country.  I think the Minister for Agriculture will agree that if you   want to stimulate industry it would be well to put on a protective tariff, and if you want to see the industry growing you will give it every possible encouragement.  He will agree also, I am sure, that every £30 saved to the country is a net gain, and that is a very different thing from the £116 Deputy Byrne says is lost to the Exchequer.  The Deputy spoke about tobacco-growing in County Louth, and the frost destroying the crops. I am sure the Minister for Agriculture must have concealed himself for a few moments.  Listening to that, he would surely realise that at one time, not very long ago, they had to throw potatoes into the sea in the neighbourhood of Louth because they were affected by blight. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy has the wrong end of the stick. 
     
     
      
       It is the right end of the stick.  The potatoes were diseased. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is entirely wrong.  Ask Deputy Derrig. 
     
     
      
       I suppose it never happened that a crop had any kind of disease? 
     
     
      
       It is a pity to see the Deputy going wrong.  The point is made that a certain amount of potatoes in Cooley were thrown into the sea.  They were thrown into the sea, but that was because there was no sale for them.  They were in perfectly good health, and they were sound, eatable potatoes.  There was no sale for them, and they were thrown into the sea.  It is not because they were diseased. 
     
     
      
       I stand corrected.  In certain areas in the Free State potato crops are affected and are not allowed to be used for seed purposes. That is no reason why potatoes should not be grown any more in the country.  If Irish tobacco is so horrible that there is no market for it and that nobody would ever smoke it, then why put on any restrictions? I have heard of people who on occasions were driven to smoking tobacco made from cabbage leaves?  If there is   an inclination on the part of people to smoke cabbage leaves, why not put the same restriction upon the growing of cabbages as upon the growing of tobacco?  Why not instruct the people that before they can grow cabbages in their gardens the revenue officials must make investigations and must inspect their cabbage plots? Then before the cabbages are ripe the revenue officers will come along, count the heads just as they do the leaves of tobacco, and enforce the regulations common with the production of the tobacco leaf.  Why not instruct cabbage growers to put their leaves in a specially built shed three miles away? 
       There are all sorts of regulations in connection with tobacco and I have tried to get them.  A certain gentleman has tried hard to produce tobacco and to a certain extent he has been successful.  There are certain restrictions imposed upon him. In order to grow tobacco to manufacture cheroots or small cigars he has to comply with all sorts of regulations. He has to get two citizens to sign a bond for £2,000 which would be forfeited for a breach of any of the regulations.  One of the regulations is that he must get the revenue officer to inspect the produce in the bonded warehouse, and in order to meet other regulations he must provide a room of a certain temperature.  He must provide certain prescribed sanitary accommodation and he must have at all times warm water for the gentlemen. Down in County Wexford it is rather hard to require all those things to be provided for the officer who arrives. 
     
     
      
       Any sugar or cloves? 
     
     
      
       These things are in the regulations. 
     
     
      
       Do you want him to get a punch? 
     
     
      
       The regulations are there, and these are the restrictions you place on the marketing of tobacco in this country.  The point that appeals to me in connection with the amendment introduced by   Deputy O'Reilly is this: If the tobacco is as bad as it is supposed to be &mdash; the Minister for Finance when speaking recently said &ldquo;The question of tobacco has often been discussed in this House.  I would like to say that if ever there was a dud proposition it is the growing of tobacco here.&rdquo;  He goes on to refer to the subsidy, and the President, interjecting a remark in connection with a remark made by Deputy Dr. Ryan, said: &ldquo;People eat the sugar, but would the Deputy smoke the tobacco?&rdquo; If there is no danger of anybody smoking the tobacco, there certainly would be no danger then of any loss of revenue accruing, and the £116 an acre Deputy Byrne speaks of would not come into being.  Therefore why not place less restrictions on the growing of tobacco and let us see if, after a period, a taste cannot be developed for Irish-grown tobacco. The duty on Irish-grown tobacco is something like 6/8 per lb., but in view of the fact that this tobacco is weighed almost immediately after it is gathered in you are paying more, because the leaf is moist, and you are paying 6/8 per lb. on the water content of the tobacco you gather in.  Then we are told you have no restrictions.  In the first instance, it is impossible for people who want to experiment to get on with these experiments because of the regulations.  Even if the amendment of Deputy O'Reilly is not accepted by the House, I would recommend the Minister to revise the regulations in regard to the growing of tobacco.  Make it possible for people to experiment and then we will see if the people can get on. 
     
     Deputy Byrne referred to large quantities of tobacco lying in a bonded warehouse.  Naturally no one wants to buy it, because it is bad value.  If Deputy Byrne travelled and was marooned in America, he would have to smoke American cigars.  At first he would not like them, but if he left America he would be sorry he did not take a supply with him, because he would have   acquired a taste for them.  The same thing would happen if he were marooned in Egypt.  He would have acquired a taste for Egyptian tobacco.  It is a matter of acquiring a certain taste for tobacco.  I believe if the regulations were less rigid, and if tobacco growers were able to develop even in a small way, the sale of their own tobacco in this country that after a while people would acquire a taste for it.  The tobacco would be cheaper for the workmen and the people, and if this huge duty were not put on it the State would be saved the terrible inconvenience their officers would be put to in travelling around the country.  Imagine the shock an officer would get if he arrived in Wexford and did not find warm water to suit his requirements. I am quite satisfied if the tobacco is as bad as it is made out to be there is no necessity for Government regulation.  No one would use it, and consequently there would be no loss to the Exchequer.  If the tobacco would be used, as Deputy O'Reilly pointed out, in two or three years time, and if by that time the revenue was affected, taxation could be put on native grown tobacco, at first in a small way, and then increased to a larger amount.  By that time we would be able to judge by giving it a free hand, whether the people of the country would support it or not.  Revenue would be got from the use of it, because if people got used to it they would not return to imported tobacco when the home-grown tobacco would be cheaper than the imported.  No one expects to be able to produce a Corona cigar here, but no workman is in a position to pay 2/6 for a cigar.  I have discussed this matter with a gentleman who produced cigars in this country. I believe that, according to him, workmen could get cheroots, or small cigars, for a nominal sum, and that after a while we can develop a taste for our own cigars.  The revenue could then impose this duty on native grown tobacco.  To argue, on the one hand, that Irish tobacco is no use and never would be smoked, and at the same time to enforce all those regulations, seems to be an argument   for not wishing to have any tobacco produced in this country. 
     
      
       I said on the Second Reading of this Bill that I was not wholly satisfied that this matter of tobacco-growing had received all the consideration it was entitled to, and I remain of that opinion still, in spite of the unfavourable circumstances to which Deputy Byrne has called attention.  I think still that there is a good deal more that requires to be gone into.  I do not believe that the British Government in the old days was so anxious to throw money away that they were prepared to give large subsidies to an industry which was quite worthless. In fact for a good many years this industry, though it never paid commercially, was reasonably successful. So far as the suggestion was made that the tobacco produced was unsmokeable, I still survive, although for a good many years I smoked a particular brand of cigar known as Turco Irish.  As to the particular state of affairs Deputy Byrne called attention to, that a large stock of tobacco still remained in bond and is at present unsaleable, I have been informed that that was due largely to the fact that there was, under present conditions, no certainty of continuity of supply.  For that reason the manufacturers were disinclined to go into the market and put themselves out. When that stuff was once disposed of, there was no further prospect of a supply of a like kind. 
     
     
      
       May I explain to the Deputy the report says, &ldquo;It is retained in bond and there is no Irish market available?&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       My information was that it is quite true there was no market available for the manufacturers who are not disposed to take an offer for tobacco, not seeing any prospect in the circumstances which then existed of getting any further supply.  That was, at any rate, what I was told. 
     
     I am also told that at the present moment conditions are very much   more favourable.  It may or may not be true, but I am told that certain important manufacturers have indicated that if the excise duty were removed or reduced they would be prepared to handle the stuff in considerable quantities.  If that is so, I certainly should not despair of seeing the industry established.  At any rate, all I want to suggest to the House is that there is a case for fresh inquiry.  We obviously are not going to get much further by debate in this House.  Most of us have not really got the information that would be necessary.  Deputy Byrne, Deputy O'Reilly, and some few others, may have.  Nor is the method of debate here in this Chamber or in any popular Chamber very suitable for arriving at a solution of a somewhat complicated financial and economic problem.  On the one hand, I would press upon the Government that they should give this matter further consideration under present-day conditions.  It has been represented to some of us that the conditions to-day are more favourable for the revival of the industry than formerly.  On the other hand, I would suggest to Deputy O'Reilly that he might be content with the discussion here.  I say that quite respectfully. I have no axe to grind; I have a real desire to see the industry re-established, but I do not think that a division taken on an amendment to the Finance Bill is likely to be very helpful to the re-establishment of the industry.  I do not know what the intentions are with regard to a free vote, but I should myself feel that it is a very difficult matter to upset, in however small a way, the delicate adjustments of a Finance Bill once it has been introduced. I do not believe that you will get a really considered opinion of the Dail on the subject if the matter is pressed to a division.  Even if we were better informed on the matter, than I, for one, consider myself to be, I would suggest to Deputy O'Reilly that he would be content with the discussion that has taken place and reserve his persuasiveness for another occasion when we might get a really clear and distinct vote on   this question apart from any other consideration which might unfortunately arise. 
     
       An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  took the Chair. 
     
      
       This particular matter was debated at very considerable length on the Third Stage of the Finance Bill in 1926.  I do not know to what extent the position may have changed within the past three years, but I do not think it can have changed very substantially.  The position is, at the moment, by way of a reduction of duty there is available for anybody who grows tobacco here 1/4 a pound, equivalent to about £50 an acre.  When the Committee was considering the question before it was estimated that the cost of labour in growing an acre of tobacco, including rehandling and marketing, was, taking one thing with another, from £30 to £35.  In order to secure an expenditure of from £30 to £35 an acre, there is now available a subsidy of about £50 an acre.  I think, therefore, it is quite true to say that instead of giving a subsidy for the growing of tobacco, or giving any further facilities for the growing of tobacco, it would be better to pay 30/- a week to anybody who would be engaged in the growing of tobacco without their doing the work at all. If Deputy O'Reilly's amendment were carried, it would be better to support these people on the scale of a rural labourer, without the trouble of doing all this work.  Attempts have been made to draw a parallel between the case of tobacco and the sugar subsidy.  But let us remember that in one way or another since 1907 assistance has been available for the growing of tobacco.  There has been a very long experimental period, and the evidence that was available when this matter was examined three years years ago showed if there was no duty at all on tobacco, neither a Customs duty nor an Excise duty, that tobacco could not be grown here unless we paid a subsidy round about £40 an acre in perpetuity.  Before there would be any justification for re-examining the matter we would   need to get some sort of indication that the circumstances are entirely changed.  Of course, the proposal of Deputy O'Reilly is so utterly preposterous that it hardly merits any discussion, because it is all based on the maintenance of a customs duty. It would work out at a subsidy of about £260 an acre for the growth of tobacco.  A loss of £260 of revenue for every acre of tobacco grown. 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister state how much is collected in revenue from every acre of tobacco grown? 
     
     
      
       About £260. 
     
     
      
       It is more.  What is really suggested is that for every acre of tobacco grown the revenue would lose £320.  It would lose the equivalent of the duty at present collected on 800 lbs. of tobacco.  That revenue would have to be made up in some other way.  We would have to put it on tea or something else, and all that in order to get £35 an acre on wages paid to labour.  That, as I have said, is too preposterous for consideration. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister still argue that the tobacco would be useless, that it would not be smoked by anyone? 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy was listening to me he would understand that it was on the basis that it would be smoked, and that it would replace imported tobacco, that I was arguing. When the experiment was started a lot of people believed that ultimately tobacco growing would become economic here without a subsidy. That has not turned out to be the case.  There is no prospect at all that it will become economic.  As I have said, the suggestion is this &mdash; prices may have altered slightly within the past few years, but when we were discussing it, it was suggested here that farmers could not grow it, that it would not pay to grow it, unless they could sell it at 1/6 per lb.  The position then was that the better liked tobacco grown elsewhere could be got at 7d. per lb. 
     
     
        If you remove the duty altogether from tobacco, both Customs and Excise, then Irish tobacco could not be grown here at all, and in order to have it grown, if there were no duty on tobacco, the position would be that we would have to pay the equivalent of 11d. per pound, or something like £40 an acre, and we would have to pay that in perpetuity for the luxury of having that article produced here.  As a result of the £40 an acre, which would have to be raised off the taxpayer in some other way and which would have to go on permanently, we would only have from £30 to £35 an acre expended on labour.  As I say, I think the proposal is so preposterous that it deserves no discussion whatever.  Deputy O'Reilly began by suggesting that he was not looking for anything from the taxpayer, that it was going to cost us nothing, but when any person gets an exemption from duty that is really, especially in a case like this, an equivalent to a subsidy.  We are not proposing to abolish the tobacco duties.  We obtain a very large sum from them, and if we abolished them we would have to put a duty on some other article.  I do not think that there is any other set of articles from which we could get revenue with so little disadvantage to the public as from tobacco.  It is proposed, I take it, to continue the Customs duty on tobacco. If that is so, then, proportionately as tobacco is grown here, for every acre we lose £320.  For one, two, three or four acres nothing appreciable would result, but if the acreage increased, as the Deputy suggested it would, undoubtedly we would have to put taxation on some other article.  It is quite a good thing if there were any crop that is likely to become economic and likely to pay, and quite a good argument could be made even for a substantial subsidy in the beginning; but it would be impossible.  I think, to justify a subsidy to the amount suggested by the Deputy. 
     At present, even allowing for the difference in the price which the Irish farmer must get and that paid   for the imported article, there is an advantage, I think, of sevenpence in favour of the Irish article.  I am dealing with the figures given three years ago.  That article, of course, proved unsaleable even with such inducements and, apparently, a much larger inducement is necessary. The position clearly is that the present remission of duty is not going to get any tobacco grown.  I do not believe that any increase whatever, without going the length that Deputy O'Reilly would have us go, on the present advantage, could be justified.  As I say, the matter was discussed at great length in 1926 and, in opposing a motion for an increase of 1/6 in the difference between the imported and home-grown tobacco, in addition to the Minister for Agriculture and myself, Deputy Johnson and others spoke against the proposal, and as we were dealing with something that was more like a reasonable proposition than that of Deputy O'Reilly, the matter was fairly well discussed.  If Deputies would go back to that debate they would see, as the House clearly believed at that time, that the arguments were against going further in an attempt to subsidise this crop.  When the House divided there were 14 for and 48 against the proposal.  It was not a free vote. I do not believe that a matter like this, involving substantial sums, could be put before the House on the basis of having it decided on a free vote.  There was, however, considerable division of Parties, and I think there was a very general feeling in the House that the sort of stirring propaganda carried on in connection with tobacco-growing for a considerable time was without basis and was generally put forward without regard to the figures involved. 
     
      
       Would the Minister say what is the duty on imported tobacco, on colonial tobacco, and on Irish-grown tobacco? 
     
     
      
       There is no Colonial preference here.  Part of the history of this was that at one stage we were told that, if we did away with   Colonial preference and kept out Kenya and other tobaccos of that kind, Irish tobacco would be all right.  Colonial preference was abolished and the duty for imported tobacco became a flat 8/- on unmanufactured tobacco.  There is a variation with the moisture content. 
     
     
      
       Irish tobacco has a preference of 1/6 over all other tobaccos? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       If the Minister would not agree to this amendment, would he be prepared to reconsider his decision with regard to the regulations in connection with the growing of tobacco at home?  It is said that the duty on home-grown tobacco is 6/8, giving it a preference of 1/4.  The Minister does not dispute the fact that on every pound grown there is a duty paid on the moisture, which is not the case with imported tobacco. 
     
     
      
       The moisture regulations are the same. 
     
     
      
       I have been told that the amount of tobacco put into the warehouses shows a difference in weight.  If the Minister would go so far as to state that he would try and meet the growers and manufacturers by removing these impossible restrictions he would at least be doing something.  It is impossible for a man to get a bond to the extent of £2,000 for the compliance with the regulations, which stipulate certain conditions in regard to temperature, and so forth.  If, for instance, a Customs official gets a cold, the bondman may forfeit £2,000. 
     
     
      
       So far as matters like that are concerned I have no hesitation in saying that I will be ready to examine them, and if there is anything unreasonable or anything that could be reasonably changed, I will change it.  I am, however, determined on the question of money, and my determination is that there   is no case for increasing the present preference. 
     
     
      
       I can see, from the attitude of the Minister, that he is not going to give this question even a fair trial by getting it examined further, as suggested by Deputy Law.  He will admit that there is something over half a million pounds' worth of tobacco coming into this country in a raw state every year.  If that can be produced here, why not produce it?  The arguments of the Minister would be much more convincing if he did not apply them to practically every proposal made here to produce things which we can produce.  If we had not the advantage of having other countries around us which can supply us with every article we require, is he going to say that we should not produce them ourselves and that we should continue to import them?  Is it not obvious that we would at last reach a stage when we would not be able to import anything? Ultimately we would have to produce something, or starve.  It is obvious to me that there is a fundamental fallacy in the argument used by the Minister.  I am not saying this in reference to this particular matter, but generally to the arguments of the Minister.  There are very few articles to which that would not apply.  If we had reached saturation point in regard to work, if all our people were employed, and if we had alternative lines of employment, then we would have to be careful, I admit, as regards the line we select, but we have not reached that stage.  We have people unemployed, and every line that can absorb unemployed people should not be turned down, as the Minister for Finance has turned down this.  Those engaged in the manufacture of tobacco hold that, so far, the experiment has not got a fair trial and that vexatious interference and regulations have, in many cases, prevented the development of the industry. 
     
     I was listening to Deputy Byrne a while ago, and it is quite obvious that he wanted to have it both ways,   like a number of people.  On the one hand, he said that Irish tobacco is of no use, that nobody will use it, and that there will be no market for it.  On the other hand, he said that the revenue was going to suffer to some extraordinary amount.  It is quite clear that he cannot have it both ways.  Let us find out on which leg the opponents of tobacco-growing are going to stand.  At the present time they are trying to have it both ways.  On the one side, we are told that no matter what you do it is a tropical plant which cannot be grown here.  Why is it that in Belgium they find it profitable to grow 8,000 acres &mdash; practically sufficient to meet the home requirements?  In France and in other continental countries they do the same.  I admit that there is an argument from the point of view of the Minister for Finance in favour of tobacco as a commodity to tax.  In a sense it is a luxury, but unfortunately it is a luxury used by poorer people for the most part.  If we are going to consider it from the tax point of view, my view is that if you raise here at home half a million pounds' worth of extra produce you will have that half million pounds in the country.  You will have half a million pounds more to tax provided the labour and the raw material are not being used in a way &mdash;&mdash; 
     
      
       Will the Deputy say what is the good of producing half a million pounds' worth of tobacco for which we cannot find a market? 
     
     
      
       This proposal of Deputy O'Reilly's is just the way to test it.  Let us see whether it is worth half a million pounds.  The farmers will not produce it if they do not get a market for it.  If it is not produced there will be no loss to the revenue, so that the purpose of Deputy O'Reilly's amendment as far as I can see is to give us a chance of testing whether, in fact, tobacco which would be smoked in this country could be grown in it. You do not give the experiment a fair trial unless you do that.  As I have said, the fact which strikes me most is that there is half a million   pounds worth of a product coming into this country which experiments have proved can be produced here. If the labour and the soil which can be used for that cannot be more profitably used, then there is an increase of half a million pounds which the Minister can tax.  The net product of the community is increased to that amount which is available for further taxes. 
       I admit that from the technical point of view of finding suitable taxable commodities it may be difficult to get something else which will be suitable for taxing.  If the Minister wishes to rely on that argument, well and good, but he should not attempt to rely on three or four arguments which are really conflicting arguments. So far as we are concerned, some of us are going to support the amendment because we believe the attitude of the Minister is typical of the present Ministry not merely on the tobacco question, but on a number of other questions of the same kind.  Some of us would be prepared at any rate, seeing that there is no definite Party attitude on the matter, to let it go on the ground that the Finance Bill is a technical matter, and that it would be difficult to include all these matters at the moment, if we got an assurance that this matter would be examined, and that the stone-wall attitude adopted by the Minister at present would be abandoned.  We feel that his arguments are most inconclusive and by no means satisfactory. 
     
     
      
       This is a matter which I think should be settled definitely one way or another by the Minister for Finance.  I have heard any amount of argument for and against the amendment.  I have heard the argument that the farmers could not afford to grow tobacco.  The Minister for Finance, in one breath, said that the farmer could not grow it, and again he said that if he grows it he would have to pay £300 an acre to him out of it. 
     
     
      
       (Minister): Are you going to spend money on tobacco or wheat? 
     
     
     
      
       We might as well spend it on that as on the black-tailed pig.  We will have the same profit. 
     
     
      
       Or on grass. 
     
     
      
       You want money for both. 
     
     
      
       I find that in the year 1924, for instance, out of Irish-grown tobacco, the Minister drew £8,146; in 1925 he drew £5,565, and in the nine months ending 31/12/'25 he drew £6,463 in duty.  When we consider that we are paying the foreigner something like £700,000 for tobacco, and that the person who pays this money, and the duty and the tax on the tobacco, is the same labourer who, the Minister for Local Government said, must not get more than 29/- per week to support himself and his family, and that we can succeed in growing here at home tobacco which will satisfy his needs, I think it is a matter to which the Minister for Finance should agree.  I think that is the first point to which we ought to look, that there is £700,000 paid out of this country every year for foreign tobacco.  I am not going into the figures to show what the Minister gets out of it afterwards, but the foreigner gets the sum which I have mentioned out of it.  If we can succeed in producing that tobacco at home we will be keeping that £700,000 at home.  If the Minister for Finance takes the view that the farmer cannot afford to produce it because he will have to pay him £300 per acre, then we shall know where we stand. 
     
     
      
       I would not intervene in this debate were it not for the fact that the Minister for Finance is so uncompromising in his hostility to the amendment.  There are certain difficulties in reference to this crop which the Minister for Finance cannot afford to ignore.  But the same difficulties will affect any crop grown in this country, if it comes into the same category, in the same way dependent upon the exigencies of the Exchequer.  With reference to the crop grown in 1926,   there is really some of the tobacco in bond yet.  This time last year a market had been found for that tobacco.  It had been found after a good deal of difficulty, and after certain restrictions had been removed by the Revenue Commissioners to allow it to be sold.  The Revenue Commissioners were so long in coming to a decision, and the regulations were so rigid, that the price of the nicotine extract of the tobacco was reduced from 10/6 to 9/-.  Even then the regulations did not permit the sale of the entire crop of tobacco on the hands of the Meath growers and Offaly growers.  The bond for the consignment and the sale of the Meath crops did not include the Offaly crop, and consequently it was necessary to get a second one, with the result that the people could not undertake the expenditure or the trouble, and the purchaser would not, except he got the entire crop, incur the initial expenditure on the machinery.  Therefore the market has been lost.  I will just read an extract from a letter of Mr. Villiers Stuart, of Waterford, in reference to the purchase of the crop.  The letter is dated the 7th June, and is as follows:&mdash; 
       I am glad to hear that you have persuaded the Commissioners to assent to the disposal of the tobacco on hands.  One difficulty, unfortunately, has arisen, however &mdash; viz., price.  Nicotine was selling in quantity at 10/6d. per lb. at the time of our last correspondence. I now have before me an offer from a large German firm offering, in larger quantities, at 9/- per lb., a reduction of 1/6 a lb. This means I have no option but to reduce my offer accordingly &mdash; and you will see from enclosed memo, that the margin of profit is rather narrow even at that.  As stated previously, it would not pay me to spend £150 or more on grinding machinery unless I can get Sir Nugent's tobacco also. 
       That finished the deal for the 1926 crop last year. 
     
     The restrictions referred to by the purchaser are as follows.  This is   from the Revenue Commissioners, dated 7th August, 1928:&mdash; 
     I am, however, to point out that the existing bond furnished by Mr. Villiers Stuart to cover removals from Dublin to his store at Lismore will not cover the removal of the Offaly tobacco. 
     Finally the sale had to be abandoned and the tobacco is still on hands.  Therefore, that one market has been lost.  The final decision of the Revenue Commissioners was to smoke out tobacco.  The letter, which is dated the 8th June, 1929, is as follows: 
     I am directed by the Revenue Commissioners to call upon you to dispose of your 1926 crop of tobacco according to the regulations, or, alternatively, to destroy the tobacco not later than the 8th July, 1929. 
     That is typical of the sympathetic consideration this matter is getting. The amendment only asks that the experiment should be given a trial. It will not interfere with the existing revenue for at least two years. The Revenue Commissioners will have the experiment under observation, and if it interferes adversely with the revenue returns they can impose any terms that they like.  I do not suppose any useful purpose will be served by asking the Minister to give any undertaking to consider this on another occasion, and I, therefore, think the amendment should be pressed to a division. 
     
      
       On the question raised by Deputy Boland, as I said already, I am ready to look into the regulations and see whether they affect future crops or affect any crops on hand.  I am prepared to consider what opportunities can be given to enable people who have tobacco on hands to dispose of it.  I do not want to treat them with lack of consideration and I am prepared to look into that point.  It may be that owing to difficulties or misunderstandings a market has been lost, but if any other market can be found, or if there is the prospect of   any other market.  I am willing to consult with the Commissioners and see what can be done to help people who have this crop on hand in some way.  As I said to Deputy Briscoe, I am prepared to have the existing regulations looked into, in case anybody should think of growing tobacco with the existing preference, to see if those regulations could be amended in any way that would help them.  I would, however, ask Deputies to remember that it is not a case of no encouragement being available for tobacco-growing. There is encouragement available at the moment for tobacco-growing to the extent of £40 per acre.  No matter what views Deputy de Valera, or other members of his Party, may hold as to the need for giving encouragement to certain crops, I think that that is certainly a very substantial encouragement, and we are not proposing to withdraw it from tobacco. If any change takes place in the circumstances that makes that sufficient, or that makes it possible for people to grow tobacco under it, it will still be available. 
     
     I should like to say that no complaint had come to me about the regulations before.  I have met representatives of the tobacco growers, and we have always discussed the question of the subsidy.  I had some complaint about the question of disposing of tobacco within a certain time after it was grown, but on the regulations, to which Deputy Briscoe referred, I never had any complaint.  I am prepared to look into this.  I think that Deputies should really consider whether a preference to the extent of £40 per acre is not a very good thing for any crop whatever, considering the labour that will be employed and the value it is to the country.  I do not think Deputies can reasonably take the view that we ought to have this crop grown here irrespective of cost, either to the revenue or to the community, through maintaining a Customs tariff which will raise the internal price. To carry it to the extreme, if we were to say that the main factor is to   produce five hundred thousand pounds at home, and if we carry that argument to its conclusion, I think Deputy de Valera will admit that that argument is not valid to any length that one may care to take it. 
     
      
       Neither is the other. 
     
     
      
       I have not suggested, so far, that no preference should be given to tobacco, simply because it cannot be grown as cheaply here.  I pointed to the very substantial existing preference, and I have suggested that it should in all conscience be regarded as enough.  If you took the other line of argument, you might say that we should, regardless of cost, attempt to grow the tea used here, or something like that &mdash; to grow it in glass-houses &mdash; that the cost would not matter, provided we kept the money here that it now costs the country.  I think the Deputy will see that that is not a reasonable point of view.  If they argue it, I am prepared to admit that it is not defensible to say that in no circumstances should you pay more than the cheapest price.  Nevertheless, the whole thing must be looked at in a reasonable way, and I do not think that because there was a good deal of propaganda in connection with tobacco, we must take up the line that we must go to great lengths. 
     
     It is not fair to suggest that this matter has not been considered.  It was considered a great deal, and, as a matter of fact, most of us &mdash; I certainly myself did &mdash; came to the consideration of this matter with the desire to extend the tobacco crop.  I believed in it because of the propaganda which had been carried out by the late Arthur Griffith and others.  Most of us were believers in the prospects of the tobacco crop and we all came to the consideration of it prejudiced tremendously in its favour, and a great deal of departmental and other consideration has been given to it.  If there are substantial new facts they will be considered, but I do not know whether substantial new facts have arisen.  I think that really the supporters of   the industry themselves, if they still believe in it, ought to examine and see whether there is any other thing that can be done, whether there is something that can be suggested other than merely an enormous increase in the preference.  That would be the better way for them to approach it.  If they did approach it that way, they might have something to put up to the House that would merit a great deal more sympathetic consideration than this could merit. 
     
      
       The Minister said that I made a very preposterous proposal. I disagree with him in that. I do not see anything nonsensical in it at all.  There was a lot of nonsense talked about subsidies and committees, and all that sort of thing, in a great many cases by men who did not know anything about the business.  I dealt with the point about setting up committees, and I said that what I would like to see was that a group of farmers should be consulted and let them determine whether they would grow a crop like tobacco or not.  If they did succeed in growing it there would be a loss of revenue, which could be filled up, and if they did not succeed there would be no loss to the revenue at all.  I think I see what was behind the Minister's mind.  He fears that we might be making an attempt to break down the economic barrier, and to break down the principle adopted by the other country, and for the adoption of which that country had special reasons.  The policy that was adopted does not suit us at all.  If the farmers are to be expected to pay their land annuities, and the Government has power to make them pay or put them out, then these farmers should not be restricted because of revenue, from production, because it must be remembered that revenue lives on production.  It we continue this we will eventually get into a strange position if we do not get somebody to lend us money, and if we are not more sensible in our methods we will not get people to lend us money.  It is by production that we must live.  If the Minister does not allow production to go on   unhampered, then I say he is not going to get the revenue that he wants. 
       The point that I want to make particularly is that instead of asking a committee to decide whether a farmer could or could not grow tobacco you should let the farmers decide that matter for themselves. You need spend no money upon it. Subsidies and all that method of spending money through departments on agricultural industry always leads to corruption and demoralisation. When a farmer got £50 an acre as a subsidy for the growing of tobacco he put in about six plants to the acre, and then said they failed, and demanded his £50 and he got it.  That was what killed the operations under a subsidy.  Of course the growing failed.  You have the other process of the 1/4 rebate. Of course the farmer does not get it at all; he does not handle it.  The manufacturer gets it, and he tells the farmer that his crop is no use.  He tells the farmer that he does not grow enough, and there is no use in buying it because people will find out, that they are able to discern the home-grown tobacco, and that they will be disgusted with it. This kind of talk goes on and the manufacturer pockets his 1/4 and pays as little to the farmer as he can. He trades upon the farmer's position. 
     
     As far as the tobacco industry is at present concerned, the Minister talks about getting any substantial new facts.  There are substantial new facts, and these are some of them.  The manager of one of the biggest tobacco factories in the city, not speaking on behalf of his company, but speaking on his own behalf, distinctly stated that 40 per cent. of Irish-grown tobacco could be blended, as I said already, on account of the neutral flavour of   Irish-grown tobacco.  That is a new fact showing that you would have a market.  In any case the market would depend upon the price at which the article could be sold, and more than that upon the continuity of supply.  As long as the farmer is suspicious and as long as he finds officials wandering about his place at any time of the day or night, no matter what the subsidy may be, the farmer will not grow that crop. He feels it is an artificial something which has been started by the Government out of which he might get a few handy pounds easily.  We want to be much more practical in this matter and we want to allow the farmer to stand upon his own legs.  There is no use taking the opportunity from them and giving a subsidy.  The farmer is as smart as the Government, and if he gets the opportunity he will do the Government down.  The objection to a subsidy is that it causes demoralisation and it creates lack of confidence. 
     The tobacco industry gives a revenue of three and a half millions. The whole taxation system in this country will have very serious results for us, because the system adopted is to collect always more than you want.  The surplus is distributed to the advantage of the Government in control, and the result of the thing is that the Government in control&mdash;no matter which Government&mdash;would have a certain fixity of tenure because of that system; whichever Government gets in is likely to continue in for a generation.  I had in mind&mdash;and I admit it, and if the Minister suspected me he was quite right&mdash; the breaking down of that system which does not suit this country and which is killing it.

        Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 23 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo; 
     
      
       I was wondering if the Minister for Finance had any statement to make in connection with this section.  Certain paragraphs appeared in the papers relating to negotiations which were in progress between representatives of the readymade clothing manufacturers and the woollen manufacturers on the one hand, and the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the other.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance may have some statement to make in that connection. 
     
     
      
       I have not any statement to make.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself are considering the matter.  We have had certain representations and certain information has been supplied from the woollen manufacturers; some more has been promised.  I may be in a position to make a statement on the next stage of the Bill. 
     
     
      
       The issue involved is obviously a difficult one to decide. The Minister has stated that he might be in a position to make a statement in connection with the negotiations in progress when the Report Stage of the Bill is being considered.  It is hardly sufficient for us to be informed merely that the Minister may make a statement. We would like to know definitely, before we permit this section to pass unopposed, whether any proposals which the Government may have to make in order to modify the arrangement now in operation will be brought forward in connection with this Bill.  We are in opposition to the section as it stands, but if we were informed that the particular portion that I have in mind would be modified before the Report Stage is adopted, then we might be prepared to allow this section to pass without opposition. 
     
     
      
       I could not give the Deputy a promise that a statement on the subject will be made. 
     
     
     
      
       In that case it will be necessary for us to vote against this section of the Bill, and perhaps it would be advisable for me to make a brief statement setting forth our reasons in order to bring the matter back to the minds of Deputies. This section embodies the proposals made by the Government to meet the contention of the ready-made clothing manufacturers in the Free State that the imposition of the duty upon imported woollen cloth in February last, accompanied as it was by only a 5 per cent. increase in the duty on wearing apparel, decreased substantially the effective protection which they had been enjoying before that duty was imposed.  Deputies will remember that in the year 1925 a protective tariff of 15 per cent. was imposed upon imported ready-made clothing. That tariff was one of a number imposed at that time which have adequately justified themselves. Since that date, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has informed us that the number of persons employed in the production of ready-made clothing in the Twenty-six Counties has increased by 2,234. We know, from the trade and shiping statistics, that the importation of boys' and men's suits has decreased by just 70 per cent., since the year 1924. 
     
     I recollect that shortly after the imposition of that tariff a number of speeches were made by Ministers throughout the country, in which they justified their action in imposing a tariff on ready-made clothing, while at the same time not imposing a tariff on woollen cloth, on the grounds that it was necessary to take steps to establish firmly the ready-made clothing industry here before proceeding to afford protection to the woollen manufacturing industry.  It was a natural step to the protection of the woollen manufacturing industry from the ready-made clothing industry, whereas to proceed in the other direction and protect the woollen industry at the same time as, or before, the ready-made clothing industry, would operate against the successful working   of the ready-made clothing industry here.  It was generally believed then, and the impression was given to those concerned by officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce, that if and when a duty was imposed on imported woollen cloth, the duty imposed in respect of ready-made clothing would be increased by an amount sufficient to bring it to a point at least 10 per cent. above the duty in operation on the clothing.  The reason for that was that the ready-made clothing industry developed upon imported cloth.  The suits that were sold here between 1925 and 1929 were made almost exclusively out of imported cloth.  The woollen manufacturers in the Twenty-six Counties did not produce cloth in the same variety of designs as could be obtained abroad, and because of the fact that design plays a very large part in the demand for these ready-made suits, it was necessary to import the cloth.  The demand for suits of the particular designs that happen to be fashionable at the moment will continue and may not be met in full by the cloth available from Irish mills. 
     In fact, it was almost certain that it would not.  Because while it was probable the quantity of cloth would be sufficient it was likely, for some time to come, that the variety of design would not be sufficient.  As everybody concerned in that industry knows, the introduction of a new design or a new series of designs helps considerably to increase sales.  While the operation of the woollen duty would induce ready-made clothing manufacturers to purchase as much of Irish-produced cloth as possible, nevertheless the fact that they would have to sell their suits in competition with suits produced in England and imported into this country, would make it necessary for them, for some time at any rate, to continue to import certain English cloths in order to hold their customers. 
     If the duty upon ready-made clothing is not increased the effect will be that English manufacturers   will be able to sell their suits in this country on the same footing as Irish manufacturers, and the protection given to the ready-made clothing industry here will have been very largely destroyed, if not quite destroyed. In February last, a duty of 25 per cent. was imposed upon imported woollen tissues, but as the Imperial preference was allowed the effective tariff was 20 per cent. At the same time the duty upon ready-made clothing was increased by 5 per cent. to 20 per cent., with certain exemptions allowed in the case of cloth costing 1/6 per square yard and under seven ounces in weight.  The effect of that arrangement was to reduce the protection that had been given to the ready-made clothing manufacturers in respect of these suits for which they would still have to import the cloth. 
     The Tariff Commission undoubtedly considered the matter.  They expressed themselves of the opinion that the five per cent. increased duty which they recommended would be sufficient to protect the firm engaged in the ready-made trade from suffering any loss because of the duty upon imported cloth, but after some time, when it became evident to the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance that a mistake had been made, a proposal to increase further the duty upon imported clothing was again referred to the Tariff Commission. The Tariff Commission, however, rejected that proposal and brought in a recommendation to increase that exemption limit from 1/6 a square yard to 2/6 per square yard.  The effect of increasing the exemption limit, although it met the case of the ready-made clothing manufacturers, reduced the possible demand for Irish woollen cloth and weakened the protection which had been given to the Irish woollen industry here.  The arrangement which came into operation in February gave the ready-made clothing manufacturers of the Free State a very strong inducement to purchase the cloth produced here that was suitable for their business, but that inducement was destroyed,   in part at any rate, when the exemption limit was raised from 1/6 to 2/6. I see it now suggested in the Press that an arrangement is likely to be made whereby the exemption limit will be reduced from 2/6 to 2/-, but it seems to me that all those proposals and counter proposals which are in the air are more or less attempts made to sidestep the obvious solution of the difficulty which was suggested from these benches on each occasion when the matter was before the House, that is, the increasing of the duty upon ready-made suits to at least 25 per cent.  If that is done the inducement to Irish ready-made clothing manufacturers to purchase Irish cloth will remain unimpaired, while at the same time the protection which these manufacturers enjoy themselves will not be weakened. The only argument which has been advanced against that proposition is that it may mean a rise in the price of the ready-made suits to the consumer, but I think if that argument is examined properly it will be seen that it bears very little weight.  It would undoubtedly, of course, raise the price of an English suit made out of English cloth and imported into this country, but surely that is the purpose of the protective duties, to discourage the sale of such suits here. It will not raise the price of the suit manufactured here whether manufactured from English or Irish cloth.  The effect of the duty upon woollen cloth will undoubtedly result in a rise in the price of the suits made here from English cloth, but the suggestion to raise the duty upon wearing apparel will not have that effect by itself, and that is the proposition that is now before us. 
     Of course we know we will get the argument that the ready-made clothing manufacturers here will probably increase their prices if the duty is raised by the full amount, or almost the full amount of the increased duty.  I do not think, however, that is likely, although it would be very hard to get that idea into the minds of Ministers in view of the attitude they always take in relation to such matters.  I would like to point out, however, that in   this business there is a very considerable competition.  There are numbers of firms in this country all anxious to produce to the maximum of their capacity, in keen competition with each other.  At the moment there is no indication that that competition will be lessened.  We must also bear in mind that if such a rise in prices did take place the manufacturer could easily establish a very large trade for himself by putting on the market, as undoubtedly there will be on the market, a suit made from Irish cloth which will pay no tax whatever and which will offer an inducement in price to the consumer which will be increased as the prices of the other suits are increased.  The fact that competition is in operation will mean that suits will be sold at the lowest economic price at which they can be sold. 
     We must also remember that this industry is in competition with another industry&mdash;the handicraft tailoring&mdash;and if the price of clothing is increased to a certain extent there is a very strong inducement for people to get suits made to measure in an ordinary tailor's shop. The industry is in a peculiar position in so far as the competition of another industry comes into operation. I believe, therefore, that we are satisfied that the rise in prices in consequence of the duty is almost negligible.  On the other hand, if that course were adopted we will be keeping unimpaired the full effectiveness of the woollen tariff which the Tariff Commission and the Government considered advisable to impose, and the full effect of the duty in respect of the ready-made clothing industry which the Government considers is necessary to impose. I cannot understand why it is that the Minister for Finance or the Tariff Commission have refused to take the course that was obviously open to them on this matter on numerous occasions.  As I pointed out before, they brought in a recommendation when the matter went to them a second time which they were not asked to consider.  They were asked to consider a proposal to increase   the duty on wearing apparel and they turned it down with practically no explanation as to why, and brought in an alternative proposal which no one asked for, neither the woollen nor the ready-made clothing manufacturers.  I think if the Minister would ignore the Tariff Commission in this matter now when it is obvious that they have made a mistake, and act on his own judgment, he would take the line we are suggesting and increase the ready-made clothing tariff by at least another five per cent. 
     
      
       I think Deputy Lemass has pointed out very effectively that it is very likely there will not be an increase in the cost of ready-made clothing if his suggestion is followed and another five per cent. is put on imported readymades. The whole attitude and action of the Government in regard to the tariff on woollen goods and on ready-made clothes is typical of this.  They have been chopping and changing continually about these tariffs since they first began to consider them.  Deputy Lemass has pointed out that the tariff which has been put on imported woollen goods will operate to reduce the tariff on ready-mades.  Ready-made manufacturers in this country are not as well able to compete with the foreign ready-made manufacturers as they were previous to the imposition of the tariff on woollen goods.  That is a very bad thing.  What promise of security are the Government going to hold out to future manufacturers when they are going to put a tariff on their goods?  We hope that they will go ahead with their tariffs and protect other manufacturing concerns in this country.  But what inducements have the manufacturers of goods which we hope will be tariffed later on to increase their plant or increase their production? They may say to themselves that what happened in the ready-made clothing may happen in their case, that when they had increased their plant and trained their workers so that they were in a position to supply the home market and compete   favourably with outsiders the Government might change their minds again.  I hope that the Minister for Finance will accept Deputy Lemass's suggestion.  There is no reason why he should not.  Even if the cost of clothing did go up a little bit the people would have the money to pay for the clothing.  At the present time you have a couple of hundred people employed in making ready-made clothes in Drogheda.  It would be very little consolation to the workers who might be thrown out of employment if the price of clothes is lower when they have no money to buy them.  At the present time they are getting employment, and even if clothes did go up a shilling or two per suit they would have the money to pay for them.  If they are thrown out of employment it will not matter how low the cost of clothing is when they will not be able to buy them. 
       Another thing about the ready-made clothing is that if we have factories here making up ready-made clothes they will be close to the factories which are making the cloth and they will be able to tell the cloth manufacturers the designs they want.  It is well known that a lot of clothing manufacturers are behind the times in the matter of designs, and it would be too bad if the ready-made clothing went out of existence and the manufacturers of clothing got further and further away from the people to whom they are going to sell their completed goods. 
     
     
      
       It is not correct to state that the Tariff Commission was asked to report on an increase of the tariff on wearing apparel. What happened when the question arose after the tariff on cloth was put on as to the ability of the manufacturers to meet the needs of the clothing manufacturers, was this: that the case as it then appeared was put to the Tariff Commission. It was pointed out to them that the cloth manufacturers would not be able to supply the needs of the apparel manufacturers for a considerable time and that, in consequence of that, manufacturers   of apparel would have to import their cloth, and pay duty on goods and that the protection which they enjoyed would be diminished. Having considered all the circumstances, the Tariff Commission made the report which led to this particular section in the Bill.  The desire of the Tariff Commission, as shown in their report, was that the manufacturers of wool cloth should have this opportunity which will come to them from the clothing manufacturers.  At the same time the Tariff Commission felt that only a moderate increase in the apparel tariff could be justified without special and separate consideration, because the application was for a tariff on woollen cloth.  Incidentally, the position in regard to apparel had to be considered, but the Tariff Commission felt that they should be very slow to recommend what some people wanted, the doubling of the apparel tariff or an increase of 66 and two-thirds per cent., which Deputy Lemass suggests, without a separate application and the complete consideration of the matter.  The position now is &mdash;I do not know whether Deputy Aiken adverted to it&mdash;and will continue to be if this section is passed, that the bulk of the cloth which apparel manufacturers require is imported free and, consequently, that they are not deprived of the protection which was given them by the apparel tariff. 
     
     It is true that as long as this section continues, the protection as regards that particular range of cloth must not be taken as equivalent to the abolition of the tariff on woollen cloths.  As a matter of fact, at the present time the mills generally are doing very well.  There is only one mill, I think, which could be said to specialise in a cheaper cloth.  The other mills have been manufacturing the better class of cloth, and they are now finding a ready market.  It is admitted that there is a great deal of work going on in the mills, and that this will make it possible for them to compete in those lower grades.  It is undoubtedly a fact that the better trade and the resources   that will come to them will make it possible for them to do something in these particular lines.  It is open to them to make a further application in regard to this range of cloths if they so choose and to show the Tariff Commission that they will be prepared to meet the requirements of the clothing manufacturers. The Tariff Commission has shown that it is anxious to give them protection so far as these ranges of cloth are concerned. 
     It has been extremely difficult to get at all the facts in this case.  Undoubtedly when the original application was before the Tariff Commission the entire facts of the case were not freely and immediately put before them.  Facts that should have been disclosed immediately had, as it were, to be dragged to life.  I think a great deal of the difficulty in dealing with this, as in dealing with many of these cases, is that everything is not always frankly disclosed, and difficulties and doubts about the possibilities of executing things are not put forward.  The best side, naturally, is advanced.  It is difficult for the Tariff Commission to know the facts. 
     As I have already indicated, representations are being made and information is being supplied by the Woollen Manufacturers' Association. That information will be examined with a desire to do the best that is possible both for the woollen manufacturers and the clothing manufacturers.  I would not be prepared to adopt Deputy Lemass's suggestion and impose an extra five or, as some other people want, an extra ten per cent. on apparel without any recommendation to that effect from the Tariff Commission.  I believe if that were done that there would be an increase in the cost to the public. 
     I would like to remind Deputy Aiken that it is not only the 200 employees who are working in Drogheda who would have to pay the increased cost, but people all over the country who have no connection with the clothing manufacturers or the woollen manufacturers.   People who are miles from them, and who will not benefit in any personal way will have to pay any increased cost that may result.  I would be inclined to go a certain distance with Deputy Lemass, and to say it is not as likely in this case as in many other cases that the full amount of the tariff would be added to the price.  The manufacture of apparel is comparatively easy, and it would not be so easy therefore to make a ring which would include all or the bulk of those engaged in it and that would continue to include them. 
     If there was a tariff which made it easy for the manufacturer to buy Irish cloths, I think that probably these cloths would not be supplied at as cheap a rate as they would be if there was any great margin to spare.  Consequently I am satisfied, apart from the cloth manufacturers altogether, that the price of cloths would be such that some extra cost would fall on the purchaser, and I believe that even the cloth manufacturers themselves, without any ring, would tend to make somewhat better profits if there was a good margin.  Without saying that the entire five or ten per cent. would be taken from the public, I believe that some substantial portion would be taken from them. For that reason, and the reason I have indicated when I said that many people who would not benefit at all by the increased employment would have to pay the increased cost, I would definitely take up the position that I would not propose an increase that had not been recommended after examination by the Tariff Commission. 
     
      
       There are just a few points to which I would like to refer.  In the first place, the Minister mentioned that when the matter came before the Tariff Commission on the second occasion it was not on a proposal to increase the duty on wearing apparel.  In the report it is mentioned that the cloth manufacturers stated that their view was that the situation would be met by increasing the clothing duty by ten   per cent. and the woollen manufacturers agreed to that proposition, but the Tariff Commission turned it down and brought in alternative proposals. 
     
     
      
       The Tariff Commission is supposed to consider more sides of the case than one; that is, to consider more than the case of the applicants.  In this case, you might say that the clothing manufacturers and the apparel manufacturers were the applicants.  The Commission had to consider all the matters and was really revising its original recommendations.  It was not like a new recommendation.  It was revising certain aspects of recommendations dealing with the woollen tariff.  If two years had elapsed and the woollen manufacturers and the apparel manufacturers had come forward with a formal proposal that the apparel tariff should be increased, then there would have been nothing for the Commission to do but either to recommend the tariff or recommend against it.  What they were doing was dealing with certain points that arose out of their original recommendation. There was no fresh evidence given. 
     
     
      
       There are three parties concerned, namely, the ready-made clothing manufacturers, the woollen manufacturers, and the consumers. Both sets of manufacturers agreed to the proposition and, so far as the consumers are concerned, they are only articulate through this House and not through the Tariff Commission.  It is my view that when you have both applicants and opponents, if I may term them such, in agreement it should be automatic for the Commission to bring that forward here and let the Deputies in this House, as representing the consumers, express their opinions instead of confusing the issue by bringing forward different proposals to that about which the applicants and opponents had been prepared to agree. The Minister stated that the recommendation to increase the exemption to 2/6 per square yard means that the bulk of the cloth for ready-made   clothing is now imported free of duty.  We have no information to test the accuracy of that statement except that available in the Census of Production.  In the section relating to the ready-made clothing industry the figures are given as to the total quantity of cloth used by the ready-made clothing industry in 1926.  It represented something like £1,500,000 in round numbers.  That would show that the average price was 4/3 per trade yard, which is over the 2/6 stated here.  It would appear that the bulk of the cloth would be within the tariff limit and it is only the cheaper cloths and less than half the quantity which will be included in the 2/6 mentioned in this section. In other words, the better class cloth will still be liable for duty whereas the poorer class cloth will not.  I pointed out before when this matter was under discussion that the effect will be that there will be more suits of the poorer class sold and less of the better class because the difference in price between them will have been increased as a result of the tariff in this section. 
     
     The Minister said that the mills are doing well.  I have no doubt that he is correct in that.  The situation is probably all right at the moment in so far as the mills are taking advantage of the additional market made available by the imposition of the duty, and the ready-made clothing manufacturers are able to deal with the bulk of their business, but the Minister himself is fondest of emphasising the undesirability of chopping and changing in the matter of tariffs.  When a proposition of this kind comes before us we like to see it settled at once instead of modifying it by successive steps in the hope that we will ultimately reach the right solution.  The Minister said that if the ready-made clothing manufacturers are not satisfied they can come forward to the Tariff Commission with new proposals. Later on he said that certain information was submitted to him by a deputation which he received.  I would like to know if it is intended that he will take action on his own behalf as a result of these representations   or whether he will refer the matter again to the Tariff Commission after hearing all the representations that could be made to him.  It seems to me that there is a degree of uncertainty in this matter.  That is most undesirable.  If the Commission is to deal with every suggestion in regard to the modification of a tariff we know where we stand, but if, on the other hand, as has happened, the tariff recommended by the Commission can be modified without further reference to them it is another matter.  It happened in the case of the woollen duty&mdash;I am speaking from recollection. 
     
      
       It did not happen.  The only case in which I know that that was done in any substantial way, apart from verbal alterations, was in the case of glass bottles, and there there was agreement from all parties. 
     
     
      
       I would like to be informed whether the Minister proposes to refer the representations made to him to the Tariff Commission or whether he proposes to deal with them before this Bill passes. That is a matter of some importance. 
     
     
      
       I do not wish to instil new life into this discussion, but statements have been made by Deputy Lemass which I feel I cannot let pass without saying something about them.  He stated that there are three parties to an application for the tariff, namely, the ready-made clothing manufacturers, the woollen manufacturers and the consumers. He stated that the two manufacturing parties agreed on a certain proposal, and that, therefore, it is the duty of the Tariff Commission to recommend the combined wish of those parties.  From my point of view that is an extraordinary statement, and I do not believe that the Deputy meant it seriously, because he must be very well aware that among the duties laid down for the Tariff Commission in the Tariff Act is that they must examine into the effects which any particular tariff will have on other industries, on the production cost, and on the general cost of living.  The extraordinary   thing about the discussion so far is that Deputies opposite seem to have only one point of view, namely, the interests of a particular manufacturing industry.  Although I am not absolutely a free trader, and although I am opposed to the general imposition of tariffs, I am anxious that manufacturing industries should be fostered, in so far as it is possible to do so, without increasing the cost of living, and without increasing the cost of production in a still more important industry. Deputy Aiken talks lightly about the imposition of a 25 per cent. tariff on ready-made clothing, and, in fact, stated that it might be increased to 30 per cent.  I need not point out to him that 25 per cent. is equal to 5/- in the £, and 30 per cent. to 6/- in the £.  There is no use in pretending that that is not so.  The general trend of industry where a tariff is imposed is that the price paid for such goods will increase almost to the extent of the margin allowed in the tariff.  That is the result as shown by the effects of tariffs all over the world. 
     
     
      
       Not at all. 
     
     
      
       It has been proved all over the world.  The day may come when internal competition may be stimulated to such an extent that it will force manufacturers down below that margin if these internal competitors do not agree. 
     
     
      
       We cannot have a debate on tariffs generally. 
     
     
      
       Generally speaking, that is the effect, and that will be the effect in this State if this proposal is carried out.  The price of ready-made clothing will, to a considerable extent, be increased almost permanently, certainly for a very long time, by the suggested tariff. The price has already increased by a certain amount owing to the existing tariff, and if the Deputy's suggestion is carried out it will be increased further.  Deputies opposite say that they are very much interested in the   farming community.  The farming community, largely owing to existing economic conditions, are obliged to purchase ready-made clothing.  There are not many farmers who can afford to go to a tailor and buy tailor-made clothes.  There is general agreement that economic conditions among the farming community are not particularly good.  Yet it is calmly suggested that in the interests of a small section&mdash;after all the ready-made clothing and woollen manufacturers are a comparatively small section of the community&mdash;we should be prepared to impose a tax of 5/- in the £ on ready-made clothing which farmers and other workers will have to purchase and which they find it difficult to purchase at present.  Surely there ought to be reason and common sense in such matters.  Some of us, are, perhaps, just as anxious to improve the industrial condition of the country as Deputies opposite, but we must approach the matter in a common-sense way and must not impose burdens on consumers which they cannot bear.  I have nothing to say against the woollen manufacturers. I stated when the tariff was first introduced that, in my opinion, of all industries it was the most suitable to the natural conditions prevailing in the country.  It is an old-established industry which has its roots in the history of Ireland.  We have had a certain amount of tradition and training in that industry, and if there is any industry which can be made prosperous by a certain amount of artificial stimulation it is the woollen manufacture and its subsidiary industries. As I say, we should approach the question from a commonsense point of view.  Although we may be anxious to stimulate the industry, we must consider that the persons who put forward the case for tariffs are persons who have a substantial amount to gain.  There are people in that industry who are bound to become rich men, even under the existing tariff, and who would become even richer if that tariff were increased.  It is, of course, impossible to prevent certain individuals gaining personal advantage,   and probably it would not be wise to prevent them.  We must remember that such persons have at their disposal various weapons of propaganda and are able to bring before Deputies and other people interested their claims for a tariff, whereas the vast unorganised body of consumers who are grumbling about these small but cumulative effects on the necessaries of life are almost inarticulate.  They are protesting, in their own way, against this ready-made and easy fashion of pretending to stimulate industry, regardless of the undoubted effect it will have on other industries, particularly on agriculture, a struggling industry which is endeavouring to stand on its own legs. If we are to do anything we ought to go slowly and balance the rights of various sections in the country. We ought not glibly and without a full sense of responsibility advocate what amounts to an enormous increase in tariffs without being fully cognisant of the unfortunate effect which it will have on the main producing industry in this country. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Heffernan thinks that all is well when he gets up and says that we must approach this matter from a commonsense point of view.  I do not think he has approached the subject with any commonsense.  If he has any commonsense to approach it with I wish he would show it now and then.  He says that an increase of five per cent. on the ready-made clothing is going to increase the burden on the farmer.  If he carries his argument to its logical conclusion we should not have imposed any tariff whatever. I do not know why he is a member of the Government that has been imposing tariffs&mdash;not as many tariffs as I should like to see, but at any rate they have been imposing tariffs.  He says that these bear hardly on the farming community. If he thinks that, he should not be a member of the Government that is imposing them.  I do not agree that they bear hardly on the farming community.  I think it would be one of the best things that ever happened to the farming community if   the 41⁄2 million pounds which we sent out yearly a few years ago for clothes of all descriptions, were kept in the country so as to give people employment in the towns to whom the farmers could sell their produce.  The Deputy talks about a few men being made rich because of tariffs.  His policy if carried out would make men in other countries rich.  If we began to buy all our ready-made clothing and woollen goods again from foreign manufacturers we would be making them rich instead of our own people.  We should keep all the people that we have employed in the ready-made clothing industry and in the woollen weaving industry, and we should add to them, and then our farmers instead of having to go abroad looking for markets would have a market at home for their produce.  We have practically no competitors at home in selling the products of our farms to our own people working in our towns, but we have competitors when we go over to sell our goods to the people whom Deputy Heffernan, I suppose, wants to continue to be made rich at the expense of our farmers&mdash;the foreign manufacturers.  The whole woollen industry is one which is particularly suitable for this country and it should get every possible encouragement.  In every country in the world where they pay attention to the organisation of industry they are trying to get their factories as near the centre of production of the raw material as possible. 
     
     We have wool here, and we have weaving going on, and we should try to keep the ready-made factories going, so that there will be no possibility of their failure.  They have proved their ability up to now, and with a little more encouragement they would be on their feet, and in a very short time might be doing an export trade.  Undoubtedly ready-made clothing manufacturers could exercise a good influence over the people who weave the material.  I certainly would like to see the ready-made clothing industry progressing, not alone for its own sake, but for its effect on the designs of the   weavers.  Our woollen manufacturers have proved, even in the last few years, handicapped as they were, that they were capable of developing their industry.  In the United States, against a 60 per cent. or 65 per cent. tariff they are sending in goods and selling their materials.  They did that with practically no help from the Government, and if they got a little help they should be able to develop that and other markets.  If we go ahead and better our designs and our marketing system we can develop a very big business in woollen goods.  It is the one industry for which we have a name abroad, and we should hang on to it and make the most out of it.  We approved of the Government putting on the 20 per cent. tariff on woollens, but we did not approve of their allowing that tariff to operate to reduce the tariff which had previously been put on ready-mades.  When the tariff went on the woollen goods the tariff on ready-made clothing should have been increased so as to keep the ready-made clothing manufacturers in the position in which they started a few years ago. 
     
      
       I think there is general agreement that the woollen industry is one suited to this country and that everything should be done to increase and extend it. But unfortunately when one gets to details as to how it is to be extended the lamentable fact comes to light that the only point upon which the apparel people and the clothing people can be got to agree is that an increased tariff should be put on ready-made goods coming into the country.  One would imagine that when two sections of the community enjoy protection&mdash;enjoy it certainly at the beginning and in so far as they are not able to supply the entire requirements of the country at the expense of the consumer&mdash;that there would have been some accommodation likely as between these two sets; that the apparel people would have gone to the clothing people and given them orders, and that the   woollen manufacturers would have made the best efforts they could to produce not exactly variety of design, because I think, as far as variety is concerned, the ready-made people are putting up impossible demands, but as far as quantity and certain variety of design is concerned they would have made a very good attempt to meet them.  One cannot get agreement or accommodation even on these terms.  As far as lack of accommodation is concerned, on the evidence put before me, I would be definitely against the ready-made clothing people as opposed to the others.  In so far as they put forward an argument founded upon a big variety of designs that they claim they require to suit the needs of their customers, I would not give in to them a great deal.  But when it comes to quantity of material at a certain price, then their contentions must be listened to. 
     
     What do we find with regard to this tariff?  Deputy Lemass has spoken vaguely of the mistakes made by the Tariff Commission and of the lack of public confidence likely to be brought about by constant changing.  There was no mistake made by the Tariff Commismission. Many a court case has been referred back after having been heard before impartial judges in whose capacity and discretion there is every confidence, simply because new evidence has come to light.  That is the case here.  There was new evidence with regard to the bulk of the cloth required by the ready-made clothing people.  On that I am not taking averages from the Census of Production figures.  I am taking an inquiry made into the books of three or four of the biggest firms in the country by officials of my own Department at a time when it was not realised what that inquiry was for and when no change in the presentation of the figures could have been made to suit their case. On that, there was definite agreement that the old exemption limit would have brought within the scope of the tariff the bulk of the   cloth required by the ready-made people. 
     
      
       The old exemption limit of 1/6? 
     
     
      
       Yes, and that the bulk of their requirements lay between the 1/6 and the 2/6 per yard. 
     
     
      
       I think the Minister has made two contradictory statements. He said the bulk of their requirements was within the old exemption limit and then he said that the bulk of their requirements lay between the 1/6 and 2/6. 
     
     
      
       Were within the tariff with the old exemption limit on.  I will put it this way: An examination of the books of three or four firms in the ready-made clothing line showed that if the woollen manufacturers could not supply cloth of the value of about 2/6 per square yard, and under, and if a tariff was still on all cloths excepting only those of 1/6 per square yard and under, that the ready-made people would be in this position: they would have to go abroad for their cloths and these cloths would be tariffed, and the woollen mills are not at the present moment producing, and are not likely to produce, in the immediate future, in any great quantity, cloths between these two points. 
     
     The ready-made clothing people had a grievance, distinctly, at that time.  It might have been said that they did not put forward their evidence in a sufficiently clear way and that they would have to suffer the consequence, but rather than do that it was decided to refer the matter again to the Tariff Commission, with the result shown in the Second Report. But once the ready-made people are faced with this situation that for these cloths which the woollen mills here do not manufacture at present, and are not likely for some time to manufacture, they can import their raw material free, and with regard to the others are getting their requirements met to a great degree here at home in the dearer cloths, and, at the same time, have some increase added to their tariff,   then they have no grievance so far as the change of tariff is in question. It may be said that they have not the exact percentage&mdash;if a mathematical calculation was made that there is a decrease.  They may not have the same mathematical percentage of tariff that they had before, but they have a tariff judged by the Tariff Commission to be sufficient, and if they think it is not sufficient&mdash;if they think the old tariff was not sufficient, or that under the new conditions the present increase does not give them the old protection they had, and can prove that the old protection was the minimum they required, at least was the reasonable protection they required, then they have a clear case to go before the Tariff Commission, and they can proceed with it.  That is a distinct case altogether from this modification of the woollen tariff. 
     
      
       Could not the Minister do what he did with the exemption limit?  When new representations were made he referred it back to the Tariff Commission.  Could he not refer this question back also? 
     
     
      
       No such request has been made to me either through the Advisory Committee or otherwise, that, ordinarily speaking, the old tariff was not sufficient, or that with the exemption granted with regard to the cloths which the ready-made people cannot get at home they are not now in as good a position as they are likely ever to get from the Tariff Commission with regard to reasonable protection.  If that case is made it should be forwarded in the ordinary way to the Minister for Finance, who would refer it to the Tariff Commission in the ordinary way that the thing goes through. With regard to the woollen people, I would much rather be subject to the charge of chopping and changing, although I do not think that that is a proper criticism to make on that point, than have a situation, when that situation as established by a particular Act was found to be a wrong one.  This matter must be looked at in its setting, and it is this: That on evidence heard&mdash;insufficient evidence &mdash;but on evidence heard, the Tariff   Commission clearly declared its mind, and that point of view was accepted by the Government, that there should be a tariff on woollen goods exempting only cloths of a value of 1/6 per square yard.  The exemption there was only given because the woollen manufacturers said they were not going to go into that end of the business&mdash;the shoddy end, the 1/6 and under.  In this situation, the Tariff Commission declared its mind exempting only the 1/6 cloth and under and tariffed everything else. 
       Then a new set of circumstances arose, and to meet that temporary difficulty&mdash;and I personally hope it is going to be very temporary&mdash;this modification is suggested.  There is the difficulty that there is not being supplied at present in any quantity the cloth between 1/6 and 2/6 per square yard.  I do not think that that will be denied.  The only thing is how soon are we going to get these supplied.  We have the mind of the Tariff Commission that all woollens should be tariffed except only what the woollen manufacturers declare their unwillingness to manufacture, and the temporary difficulty caused by the fact that at present the mills here are not manufacturing certain other cloths for which the exemption limit is raised. That exemption limit will be lowered as soon as the mills show that the consumer is not going to be mulcted heavily for cloth which the woollen mills cannot at present produce or are not able to produce in any great quantity.  Let them show that they are preparing to meet the requirements within a certain time, that they are going to be able to meet the requirements of any big percentage of the needs and the matter will be reconsidered. 
     
     Deputy Lemass raised the point as to how it will be considered. Ordinarily speaking, I think that every application for a tariff or every application with regard to modification, increasing or decreasing, a tariff should again come before the Tariff Commission.  We have a very peculiar set of circumstances   here, and if it was a matter of an application made some time hereafter to reduce this 2/6 to 2/-, I think again that is a matter that should be referred to the Tariff Commission because it is only when evidence can be got on oath, when people's mills can be visited, when there can be ocular demonstration of how many looms can be put upon certain types of work, that one gets the facts accurately.  If there was to be a sliding down of that by means of reducing the exemption limit in periods, I think there again the manufacturers should go before the Tariff Commission.  But there are certain other modifications that might be made or that might suggest themselves from time to time and, according to the importance of them and how much they depend upon evidence as to the capacity of the mills at any time to supply cloth of a particular type, they again should go to the Tariff Commission. I would hesitate to make any rigid rule in these cases of referring again to the Tariff Commission. There are certain slight modifications that might be made and I think there should be power to have these modifications made without direct reference to the Tariff Commission. 
     When this thing is looked at in its proper setting I do not think there should be any difficulty about it. Woollens are to be tariffed except a small class of goods which manufacturers say they are not going to produce although they are asking the Tariff Commission co-operatively to set up one mill to go in for the cheap type of cloth that they call shoddy to meet temporary difficulties and to meet circumstances which are clear for everyone to see.  As to the type of cloth likely to be tariffed and not likely to be produced here, obviously the consumer is going to pay for that. To meet these circumstances this modification was put in.  That may be described as chopping and changing but I would go in for further modifications as the situation rights itself because we have a very small body of territory here unoccupied by either side and the attitude I certainly   will have towards both parties in the subsequent periods will be this: That I will endeavour to get both parties to occupy it, to get the ready-made people to feed in their orders to the manufacturers so as to induce them to go into this cheaper line and the manufacturers to supply in a sufficient variety of design whatever the requirements of the ready-made people are, and whichever party shows reluctance to advance towards the other in its own way then we will have no hesitation in penalising that particular party if and when the tariff has finally to be modified.  That is the situation. 
     As to the general remarks made about the increase on the purchaser with regard to this tariff Deputy Lemass quoted certain figures which show that there has been a decrease in the import of certain articles.  So there has been.  The figures reveal further the fact that there is a big amount of work not yet done by the ready-made people and in so far as there is that there is going to be, I think, necessarily an increase of the burden put upon the consumer who is not getting his needs supplied by the ready-made people here.  Remember that the application made was for an all-round increase in the apparel tax without any reference being made as to hosiery or shirts or anything like that, without any case being made that the tariff was not sufficient and a demand made that really it should be raised by 66 per cent. 
     
      
       That was only incidental. The difficulty in that case was to get a definition that would cover suits and exclude other articles.  It was not a case of any particular desire to bring the other articles within the tariff. 
     
     
      
       That was one of the difficulties the Tariff Commission was presented with&mdash;that one would have to impose a tariff on articles still being brought into the country and including articles coming in against the higher tariff and which are still coming in because the needs are not supplied here.  To   that extent, the purchaser is feeling the pinch of it. 
       I would also like to quote the statement made here on the general debate.  It was somewhat irrelevant, but it has been referred to.  In making application for a tariff, a well-known manufacturer in this country said that, as a life-long and convinced free trader, he nevertheless applied for a tariff, because he believed, he said&mdash;this was why he was a life-long and convinced free trader&mdash;that the inhabitants of a country imposing a tariff would pay up to the hilt the full value of the tariff and also the extra profits which the retailer would seek to make on the tariffed articles.  That was in connection with Senator Dowdall's application for a tariff on margarine.  That was the statement that accompanied his application. That was a statement in the proposal for a tariff from a man who now poses as a tariff reformer, while a few years ago he was a convinced free trader. 
     
     
      
       Has that been proved correct? 
     
     
      
       He wants to be free to rob. 
     
     
      
       I do not know whether it has been proved correct or not.  I would not like to say it has. 
     
     
      
       The Minister would have in his possession evidence of proof in relation to that particular tariff, and&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I am not speaking of that particular tariff.  I say it is a peculiar thing to find a man applying for a tariff on an article in which he is interested and to find along with his application for a tariff this statement that he is a life-long and convinced free trader, and that he is a free trader because he believes the natives of the country imposing a tariff will pay up to the hilt the full amount of the tariff, and in addition the extra profits which the retailer would seek to make as a result of the tariff. 
     
     
     
      
       Is it not a most peculiar thing that the Minister should quote that very significant statement, and though he can get possession of the evidence which will enable him to say whether or not that statement was borne out by subsequent events, that he will not do so?  He has brought in this margarine case, and, as a student of these matters, I would like to know from him whether or not, having an opportunity of making a test case, he has done so and whether he can give any information to the House in proof of the truth of what he has quoted with reference to margarine? 
     
     
      
       I am not discussing margarine at the moment. 
     
     
      
       Then why refer to the application for a tariff on margarine at all? 
     
     
      
       I merely referred to Senator Dowdall's statement made when applying for a tariff on margarine. 
     
     
      
       It was wrong in both parts; the statement was wrong. 
     
     
      
       I would not like to hear the Senator being turned down without being allowed to give evidence on his own behalf. 
     
     
      
       Produce the evidence now and we will know where we are. 
     
     
      
       That was a statement made by Senator Dowdall when applying for a tariff. 
     
     
      
       The Minister now is in possession of the evidence relating to a particular tariff.  Was that statement that he has quoted borne out by any facts?  Did the consumer have to pay up to the hilt, or did he not? This is just the question, the very essence of the question, and if the House could now, from the documents and evidence in the possession of the Minister, get a straight and definite answer on that question, this would influence the whole opinion of this House in relation to tariffs.  The Minister ought be able to produce that evidence.  I do not know what   answer has he to give, but whatever that answer is, whether it proves or disproves it, I would ask for that answer and I would like the House to get it. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister going to get back to woollens? 
     
     
      
       I accept that. 
     
     
      
       The Minister would be very fortunate in getting back to woollens. 
     
     
      
       I was dealing with the matter of general tariffs brought in by other Deputies, a matter which I stated was somewhat irrelevant. 
     
     
      
       The Minister would like to be back on safe ground. 
     
     
      
       The statement I quoted was a statement that accompanied an application for a tariff. Suppose it was generally true, as Deputy Heffernan stated&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Or supposing it was generally untrue. 
     
     
      
       Let us have the precise truth about it in relation to this present tariff.  Deputy Lemass read out figures showing that there was a very big amount of tariffed suitings brought into this country, and a very big quantity still coming in.  We are asked to increase the tariff.  When the ready-made manufacturers in this country are not able to supply the needs of the country in ready-made clothing, does it stand clear to commonsense that there is to be an extra increase of articles sent in? 
     
     
      
       I am not sure that that is correct, that the ready-made clothing manufacturers cannot supply the needs of the country.  The only information I have is this information in the Census of Production. According to the Census of Production for 1926, the trade represented 75 per cent. of the total imports of 1924, the year before the tariff was imposed. 
     
     If they have been increasing between 1926 and 1929 at the same   rate as they did increase between 1925 and 1926, then the ready-made manufacturers should be more than able to supply the total needs of the country now. 
     
      
       They are not. Quite the contrary is the fact, because there are still articles coming in. 
     
     
      
       The mere fact that there are articles still coming in does not prove that they are not able to supply the total needs of the country. 
     
     
      
       The fact is that they are not able to supply as cheaply when they are in competition with the outside stuff.  There are articles coming in for some reason.  Is it altogether a matter of price? 
     
     
      
       Or a matter of taste? 
     
     
      
       Nine times out of ten it is a matter of price as far as the ready-made stuff is concerned. The whole question is one of price in relation to the durability of the article and the value a man gets out of it. 
     
     
      
       I may assure the Minister that that is not the case, and I happen to know something about the business.  It is really advertising that sells the foreign stuff. 
     
     
      
       It is alleged, anyway, that the principal consideration is the price.  There is, at any rate, stuff coming in.  Is it a reasonable thing for Deputy Heffernan to say that in so far as that stuff coming in is going to be subject to a double tariff, there is going to be an increase in the cost to the purchaser?  I think it is. 
     
     
      
       Is not the Minister assuming that the stuff will still come in despite the double tariff? 
     
     
      
       The Minister is not assuming anything.  The consumer is going to have his choice between the stuff that used to come in at a certain price and that will come in at that price multiplied by two,   and Irish material somewhere midway between the two.  Surely it is clear that some section of the community is going to have an extra burden imposed upon it by reason of this increase in the tariff?  A case has to be made for it.  If it is going to be a matter of cultivating a taste and if it is a question of not pandering to people's tastes over a certain period so that their liking for a particular thing will disappear, then there is a case to be made. Until that matter would come before the Tariff Commission it would be quite wrong, as Deputy Heffernan said, for the House to agree lightly to an increase which would mean the doubling of the old tariff. 
       This is the best way out of the difficulty that has arisen.  It is the only way, because information which should have been supplied to the Tariff Commission was not previously submitted to it.  There is going to be chopping and changing and necessarily there must be chopping and changing.  It has been recommended that no clothes free of duty should be let in except those articles which the Irish mills are not able to make or will not make.  It has been recommended that the Irish mills should get into the cheap end of the business, the shoddy end, and that then there should be a tariff without exceptions. To get to that point we will have to make certain changes with regard to time or price as the situation warrants.  I would not like to be tied rigidly to a reference back to the Tariff Commission.  I agree that, strictly speaking, the only way to deal with the matter is by reference back to the Tariff Commission. 
     
     
      
       The Tariff Commission did recommend that this matter should be reviewed after five years or that their first recommendation should come into operation automatically at the end of five years. This section seeks to impose an exemption limit and will remain. 
     
     
      
       No&mdash;&ldquo;or within five years.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Five years after 23rd May, 1929, the first recommendation   of the Tariff Commission comes into operation.  Is not that so? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       The question then arises as to the efforts which the Minister for Industry and Commerce says he is going to make to induce both parties concerned in this matter to cover what he will refer to as no man's land, the area between 1/6 and 2/6.  Does he not think that his efforts will be fruitless because of the obvious fact that it will be contrary to the financial interests of either party to secure the position which he hopes by his efforts to secure?  It will not be in the interests of the woollen manufacturers to produce a cloth within these limits because of the fact that they will have to sell it in competition with the cloth imported here and without any substantial hope of making a profit; whereas, on the other hand, the ready-made clothing manufacturers, because of the fact that they can and will continue to import that particular cloth, the design and variety of which they have been accustomed to, will not be under any inducement to give orders to the Irish mills to supply cloth of that nature.  It will be profitable to the woollen manufacturers to keep out of that area altogether, and it will be profitable to the ready-made clothing manufacturers to keep them out.  Therefore, I believe the Minister's efforts will be largely fruitless.  I believe it is unlikely that any party will go to the Tariff Commission with a proposal for the reduction of the exemption limit and an increase of the duty.  The ready-made clothing manufacturers might go looking for an increase in duty, but not for a decrease in the exemption limit.  The woollen manufacturers may look for a reduction in the exemption limit, but they will not seek an increase in the duty.  It is unlikely that such a recommendation will at any time go to the Tariff Commission within the terms of the Tariff Commission Act unless it is made by the Minister himself. 
     
     
        We find it practically impossible to vote against this section.  There are three sub-sections included in it, with two of which we are in agreement. Also, if we succeeded in carrying our opposition to the first sub-section we would be merely getting back to the original situation which existed after the duty was imposed last February.  We are prohibited in the circumstances from opposing the section and consequently we will have to let it go, having voiced our objections to it, and we will record our objections to the Government's attitude by voting against the Bill. 
     
      
       The way that I would seek to try to show both parties that it is profitable for them to agree to help each other in this matter is this: I would say to the woollen manufacturers: &ldquo;Your complaint at the moment is that you are being deprived by reason of the exemption limit of what amounts to 80 per cent. of your entire business.&rdquo; They say they are being deprived of what amounts to 80 per cent. of the entire business because the ready-made people hold the cloth of those other business firms, and that cloth represents 90 per cent. of their business.  There is a big amount of the trade to be done in selling cloth to the apparel people. You have more left than the mere promise of the Tariff Commission that as soon as you show yourself able to supply the material in any quantity the tariff goes on. 
     
     
      
       Automatically&mdash;that is the point. 
     
     
      
       As soon as they are able to produce the cloth in sufficient quantities the tariff goes on.  To the other people I would say: &ldquo;There may come a day, a year or two, or five years hence, in which you will be faced with the same position.&rdquo; The woollen manufacturers may say that they are in a position to supply.  The apparel people may have made changes, but they are not absolutely ready at a given date to supply.  The ready-made people will have to make their complaint again,   and if that tariff is put on we will have to buy from England, importing against the tariff.  We will say to them: &ldquo;It serves you right because it is through your own negligence that you are left there.&rdquo;  It is in the interests of both parties to help each other.  Under the old report of the Tariff Commission the exemption limit was 1/6d. 
     
     
      
       I would not intervene at all in this debate except for the attempt made by the ex-leader of the Farmers' Party to misrepresent the Farmers' Union.  When we hear statements made here that the farmers are opposed to tariffs, or that they are opposed to any tariff, I say here publicly that I represent as many farmers as Deputy Heffernan any day of the week, and I say&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       There was no such statement made. 
     
     
      
       I beg your pardon. You would want to get the official report of what you said.  Perhaps you do not remember it.  I say here that anything in the way of industry that is started in this country which would succeed in giving employment to one hundred more people here will be welcomed by the farming community. I say further that Deputy Heffernan's statement that the farmers, owing to their present condition, have to buy ready-made clothing, is in itself a sad comment on the action of his Party here, and that statement throws a great deal of light on what has been happening here.  I think if Deputy Heffernan's influence and the influence of the farmers here was used towards getting a tariff on the £6,000,000 worth of agricultural imports and foodstuffs they would be doing more for the farmers than&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       The Sligo-Leitrim election is over. 
     
     
      
       I am not accustomed to making speeches like Deputy Heffernan, but if a tariff were put on agricultural products&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       What about woollens? 
     
     
     
      
       Yes, I am talking straight about woollens, but I have to reply to the statements made by Deputy Heffernan&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Oh, no.  The Deputy must talk about woollens. 
     
     
      
       Well, after all, the case was made and it was brought up here in that form, and my intervention in the debate is just to say that, in my opinion&mdash;and I express the viewpoints here of practical farmers &mdash;every effort should be made to find a home market here by finding employment in this country for our own people.  I say that action on those lines by the Government will be welcomed by the farming community. I think that every statement made here on tariffs is made with the object of misleading this Assembly and the people whom they pretend to represent here, or rather, to misrepresent here, for so many years, but I think they are now getting their answer.  I do not think there is any occasion to go further into the matter, but I say that Deputies should be careful when they stand up here and make statements about people whom they do not really represent. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy will be more careful in future. 
     
     
      
       I want definitely to say that Deputy Heffernan was repudiated by the farming community recently when he made an effort to dismiss 700 men in his Department. The farming community repudiated him and then he had to come in here and crawl. 
       Section 23 put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I want just to say&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       What is the Deputy going to speak about? 
     
     
      
       On the section of the Bill.  I want to move, if necessary, the adjournment for the purpose of calling attention to what I consider a matter of great importance to this House in relation to the   whole question of this tariff on woollens. 
     
     
      
       Section 23, on which I understand the Deputy wishes to speak, has been carried. It was under discussion for some time. 
     
     
      
       I did not notice that it had been put. 
       Sections 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       To insert before Section 30 a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       On and after the First day of August, 1929, entertainments duty within the meaning of Section 1 of the Finance (New Duties) Act, 1916, shall not be charged or levied on payments for admission to any entertainment which on application by the promoters has been certified by the Minister for Education, or other authority recognised as competent by the Minister for Finance to be in the actual effect on those taking part in or witnessing same as predominantly educative. 
     
     As the Minister has repudiated the child of his own that I offered him to-night, perhaps at this late hour he may be more willing to take one of which he, I think, is god-father. I think he will be reasonably familiar by now, and probably a few members of the House are reasonably familiar with the subject matter of this amendment.  We have been faced by the fact that there are particular so-called entertainments in Ireland which have behind them, not merely a background, but an absolute structure of educational effect, and I think the Minister for Finance is quite as strongly as I am in favour of seeing that entertainments of that character which can be so described shall not be penalised and used as a method of inland revenue.  Anything more absurd than to suggest that educational activity in the country should be actually taxed for revenue I can   hardly conceive as a proposition. Now the position that the Minister took up on the last five or six occasions, I think, on which we discussed this matter was that he was entirely in favour of doing this thing.  He did not know how to do it without increasing the area of exemption further than was desirable. He and his staff were to go into it in the last year.  He was to consider a formula which I put before him.  He was to consider some alternative formulas of his own and see if, by any possibility, a formula could be got which was watertight, which would exclude from the area of taxation educational activities under the form of entertainments, and which would not allow, under that exemption, entertainments which were not strictly educational.  In this amendment we have taken every means of assuring that they shall be actively educational. We have taken the responsibility of saying that the onus of proving to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that they are educational shall be upon the promoters of those enterprises, and that the cost of proving that they are educational to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance shall be on the promoters.  I do not think we can possibly go further than that. 
     I have one particular entertainment, or series of entertainments, in my mind, and I merely take that as typical, because of what I know of that particular activity.  It is the Cork Shakespearean Company; if that will not pass as an educational activity, I do not know that you can get anything to pass as an educational activity under the form of entertainment.  We have had it certified as being actively, continuously, and effectively educational by the highest educational authority in the city of Cork; that is, the President of Cork University.  You have its effect, as an actual educational effect, certified by every representative of the city of Cork of all political parties.  You have its educational effects certified by public men of all sorts and kinds; men who are   fully competent to form an opinion on the subject.  We have merely taken that as a test case, and we ask that the Minister shall now accept this god-child of his, and at this late hour of the night give him a hearty and fatherly welcome and enable us to get quietly home to bed.  It will save us a lot of discussion if the Minister will say that he accepts the principle of the amendment; and if there is any detailed changing to be made in the wording, conditions or qualifications of the certificate, or anything else, he can put this in in the Report Stage.  We have tried to meet him in every possible way.  The onus of proving that it is educational to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance shall lie upon the promoters of the entertainment, and shall be at the cost of the promoters of the entertainment. 
     
      
       I asked a question of the Minister this morning in reference to a matter which has direct bearing on this amendment. 
     
     
      
       It has no bearing whatever on it.  The Deputy's question was of a different nature.  The Deputy's question referred to concerts for a philanthropic purpose.  This amendment refers to entertainments which are predominantly educative. 
     
     
      
       The matter I intend introducing is educative and philanthropic. 
     
     
      
       We will hear the Minister for Finance and then adjourn. 
     
     
      
       I will deal with this matter from the educational point of view.  I have here before me letters received from the honorary secretary of the Aghada Development Association. 
     
     
      
       That is not relevant.  The Deputy cannot go into that. 
     
     
      
       I hope to prove, A Chinn Comhairle, that this matter is directly educative; and I think it   will be an education to the Minister as to the manner in which his officials are working.  I think it will be an education that will be of great benefit to him and the community in general. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy cannot raise that particular matter. He had better sit down. 
     
     
      
       When I raised this matter this morning I think I was informed that I could raise it on amendment 7. 
     
     
      
       At the end of Questions I told the Deputy that the matter he wanted to raise did not arise on amendment 7. 
     
     
      
       Will Deputy Corry be entitled to raise it on the clause itself when the amendment is out of the way? 
     
     
      
       I cannot answer that until I see the clause. 
     
     
      
       If I cannot raise it in this way I will only have to ask another question or raise it on the adjournment. 
     
     
      
       As I cannot accept Deputy Flinn's amendment, I will move to report progress. 
       Ordered that progress be reported. 
       The Dail went out of Committee. 
       Progress reported. 
       The Committee to sit again tomorrow. 
     
   
   
     Adjournment Debate. - A Sligo Arrest. 
     
      
       Deputy Cooney has given notice to raise the matter of Question 11 on to-day's Order Paper.  I have come to the conclusion that it would not be desirable to raise what Deputy Cooney wants raised until the court proceedings in the case are finished.  Therefore, I cannot allow Deputy Cooney to proceed. 
     
     
      
       Could you not allow me to proceed until I infringe the   regulations?  I know that the Minister said&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I am not going on what the Minister said at all.  I am concerned with the rules of order which prescribe that we cannot deal in the Dail with matters which are coming before the courts. Having read carefully the question and answer, the supplementary questions and answers, I have come to the conclusion that what Deputy Cooney desires to raise could not be raised at all without in some way impinging upon matters which will come before the court.  I, therefore, cannot allow this matter to be raised. 
     
     
      
       May I submit that what I want to raise was a matter against the Guards?  The Guards are not charged in connection with this matter at all.  There is a charge against a man whose name is mentioned in the question, but there is an allegation against the Guards which I wish to put before the Minister. 
     
     
      
       It was on that ground that I accepted the Deputy's notice to raise the question. But on consideration of the matter since it seems to me that that question also is very likely to arise in the court.  Certainly, in other cases it has arisen.  If the conduct of the Guards at the arrest and subsequent to the arrest is to be dealt   with in the court, you cannot deal with it here. 
     
     
      
       One point should be taken into consideration here.  It is that Deputy Cooney, I think, was a witness of the arrest. 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       Even if he were, that would exactly corroborate the particular decision which the Chair has given.  If he were a witness he should not be heard here until the matter was dealt with in court. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Cooney could go down to Sligo and give his evidence. 
     
     
      
       You are not ruling now that we cannot deal with the conduct of the Guards at all? 
     
     
      
       No. I am simply ruling that as the matter is coming before the court, it cannot be dealt with here now. 
     
     
      
       Will you allow it to be dealt with on Wednesday? 
     
     
      
       When it has come before the court I can give the matter further consideration.  At the moment I am ruling that until this comes before the court we can not debate it here. 
       The Dail adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until Friday at 10.30 a.m. 
     
   
   
     Written Answers. - Dail Eireann Loan. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state if Cormac McDermott, Main Street, Castlerea (now living in Cloonarrow, Castlerea), subscribed £5 (five pounds sterling) to Dail Eireann Loan, 1919-20; and, if so, when he proposes to repay it. 
     
     
      
       Authority to issue a Savings Certificate to Mr. Cormac McDermott, of Cloonarrow, Castlerea, which will enable him to obtain repayment of his subscription to the Dail Eireann Loan, has been given to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. 
     
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether the following are registered as subscribers to Dail Eireann Loan for the following amounts: Andrew Parle (£5), Michael Redmond (£1), John Lambert (£1), Michael Forde (£1), Edmund Murphy (£2), B. Murphy (£1), W. Walsh (£1), J. Keating (£1), P. Carey (£1), J. Fitzhenry (£1), and R. O'Brien (£1), all of Tagoat, Co. Wexford. 
     
     
      
       I would refer the Deputy to previous replies given by me to similar questions and to the statement I made in the Dail on the 22nd June, 1928.  The claim of any subscriber who applied in writing before the expiration of the prescribed time for repayment of his subscription will be dealt with in my Department in due course. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Mr. Michael Finan (Philip), Lisalway, Castlerea, sent his receipt for £1 (one pound) subscribed to the Dail Eireann Loan, 1919-20, to the Finance Department twelve months ago, and has not since been repaid; if he will state whether it is intended to repay Mr. Finan's subscription; and if he will give instructions for the return of the receipt. 
     
     
      
       Authority to issue a Savings Certificate to Mr. Michael Philip Finan of Lisalway, Castlerea, which will enable him to obtain repayment of his subscription of £1 (One Pound) to the Dail Eireann Loan, has been given to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is not the practice to return receipts in cases in which repayment has been authorised. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state how soon he expects to be in a position to authorise issue of Savings Certificates to the following subscribers to Dail Eireann Internal Loan (1919-20):&mdash;Mrs. Deborah M. Condon. Ruphla, Kilfinane, Co. Limerick, £25; Patrick Kennelly, Ballinagoul, Glin, Co. Limerick, £2; Thomas Dillane, Kinnard, Glin, Co. Limerick, £3; Margaret Pierce, Ross, Dromcollogher, Co. Limerick, £3;   Maurice Drake, Ballinacourty, Kilfinane, Co. Limerick, £25; and Daniel D. Casey, Killeedy, Ballagh, Charleville, Co. Cork, £5. 
     
     
      
       I would refer the Deputy to previous replies given by me to similar questions and to the statement I made in the Dail on the 22nd June, 1928.

     Written Answers. - Reconstruction of Ballinamore N.S., Donegal. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Education whether any tenders were received for the reconstruction of Ballinamore N.S., Fintown, Co. Donegal, before 8th May, 1929, and what is the cause of the delay in having this work, which was sanctioned in 1923, put in hand. 
     
     
      
       The lease of the school plot which was required precedent to the making of a grant was completed in November last.  A grant for the enlargement and improvement of the school building was then definitely sanctioned and the fact was communicated to the Commissioners of Public Works. 
       Tenders for the work were obtained on three occasions before May last, and I am advised that, of the contractors, whose tenders were accepted, one withdrew, and another desired to make a considerable increase in the price tendered, which was not allowed.  The remaining tenders were regarded as excessive in price. 
       Consequently it became necessary to obtain fresh tenders, which have been received and are under consideration. 
       It is expected that the work will be commenced when the school is closed for summer vacation.

Mayo, for a loan to enable him to erect a dwellinghouse on his holding (R. Kelly estate, Rental No. 21). 
     
     
      
       The Commissioners have considered Patrick McMyler's application and cannot see their way to grant him assistance.
