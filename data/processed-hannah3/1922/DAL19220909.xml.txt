     ELECTION OF CEANN COMHAIRLE. 
    
      
       It is necessary that the Dail should now proceed to elect a Ceann Comhairle.  The Clerk of the Dail will accept a Motion for that purpose. 
     
    
      
       May I ask at this stage whether all Deputies are supposed to sign the Roll? 
     
    
      
       Yes.  All are supposed to have signed it. 
     
    
      
       I have not signed the Roll.  I want some explanation before I sign.  I have been elected in pursuance of a Decree of Dail Eireann, which Decree embodied the Decree of May 20th, 1922.  I have heard nothing read with reference to that Decree, nothing but an Act of a foreign Parliament. I have not been elected to attend any such Parliament.  I have been elected as a Member of Dail Eireann.  Will anyone tell me with autlority whether it is&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       There is no Ceann Comhairle in the Chair and you cannot address the Dail in those circumstances. 
     
    
      
       Oh, bosh!  Will anyone tell me&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       The election of a Ceann Comhairle will now be proceeded with. 
     
    
      
       Will anyone tell me with authority whether this is Dail Eireann or a Partition Parliament? 
     
    
      
       It is now necessary that the Dail proceed to elect a Ceann Comhairle. 
     
    
      
       I want a definite answer to my question.  The public are watching.  I want to know whether this is Dail Eireann or a Partition Parliament.   I want to know that, and I want to know if the Republican Member for Fermanagh attends here will he be heard? 
     
    
      
       I beg to propose that Prof. M. Hayes be elected Ceann Comhairle. 
     
    
      
       I wish to second that. 
     
    
      
       Are there any other nominations? 
     
    
      
       I do not want to create a scene in the Dail, but I am going to continue talking here until I get an answer.  If the answer is not satisfactory, then I will walk out and there will be no harm.  If the answer is as I wish it to be, I will sign the Roll and keep my seat.  Is this Dail for the whole of Ireland? 
     
    
      
       The usual procedure is to have a Speaker elected. When the Ceann Comhairle is elected the business of the Dail proceeds. 
     
    
      
       The business of the House cannot proceed while a Member of Parliament in my position is not given a definite answer.  It is easy to say yes or no.  Is this Dail for the whole of Ireland? 
     
    
      
       Before the motion is put I want to ask for a general understanding for every Member of the Dail, that the Speaker or the Chairman, whatever be the title, is the Officer of the Dail and not a Member of the Ministry. 
     
    
      
       Hear, hear. 
     
    
      
       Are we to understand that his duties will be to safeguard the interests of the Dail, or the Members of the Dail, against any authority within the Dail or outside the Dail? I think it is well we should understand right from the beginning that there is a difference between a Minister and the Chief Officer or Guardian of the liberties of the Members. 
     
    
      
       This business can go on as peacefully as you wish, and as I wish, if I get an answer.  I want to know whether I am entitled to sit here or not.  I am not entitled to sit in a Partition Parliament.  I am entitled to sit in Dail Eireann.  Can someone say whether this Dail is for the whole of Ireland or not?  A courteous answer will satisfy me and there will be no more friction. 
     
     
    
      
       A Ceann Comhairle has been proposed and seconded.  As I understand his duty, he is to discharge the duties of his Office impartially.  The Ceann Comhairle who has been proposed is not or will not be proposed for membership in the Government, and there is really no necessity for mentioning such a matter at all.  We are not such children in the matter of Government that we would propose to put a Minister holding Office or holding a Portfolio in the Government, in the Chair. 
     
    
      
       I think the proper procedure to take is to elect a temporary Chairman for the time being, and then put a motion afterwards for the election of a Speaker.  Consequently I beg to move&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       I cannot take any amendment to this.  It is only a proposal that Prof. Hayes be made Ceann Comhairle.  It is proposed by Mr. Blythe and seconded by Mr. Hogan. No opposition?  I therefore declare&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       The matter cannot be disposed of that way. 
     
    
      
       If there is no other nomination I declare him elected Ceann Comhairle. 
     
    
      
       You have not waited for a nomination. 
       
         At this stage the Chair was taken by Mr. Ml. Hayes. 
       
     
    
      
       Before the Speaker takes the Chair I want to support a few remarks made by a gentleman on the other side. 
     
    
      
       Do hiaradh orm an Chathaoir a thogaint annso.  (I was asked to take the Chair here.) When the Ceann Comhairle is speaking, you, Sir, cannot speak.  That is an elementary rule of debate. 
     
    
      
       Before you&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       You cannot speak while I am addressing the Dail.  That is an elementary rule of debate.  Do hiarradh orm an Chathaoir seo a thogaint.  Do cuireadh an cheist orm an mbeadh an Cathaoirleach 'na aire don Rialtas nu an mbeadh se sa Chathaoir chun saoirse na dTeachtai do chosaint.  Ni bheidh aon bhaint agamsa leis an Rialtas agus tabharfad cheart do gach aoinne sa Tigh.  Is mor an onoir   domhsa bheith sa Chathoir.  Ni doich liom gur gadh dhom a thuille a ra. 
       I thank you for the honour you have conferred on me in electing me Chairman of the Dail, and I should like to say in reply to, I think, the very proper question that was put that, as Chairman of the Dail, I can promise no more than to do my very best to give absolute fair play to any and every member of the Dail.  The idea of a Minister of the Government being Chairman of the Dail is preposterous, and I would not accept such a position.  If the statement I now make that fair play will be given to every member of the Dail is accepted, I shall go on with the business.  If it is not accepted, it will be obviously impossible for me to remain in the Chair. 
     
    
      
       My desire was that there should be a general understanding that the position of the Speaker of the Dail should be that of a servant of the Dail directly, whose business it would he to safeguard the interests of the members.  I accept your statement unreservedly, and I only desire that it should be recorded at the beginning of the business of this Assembly. 
     
    
      
       Arising out of that matter, I am perfectly certain that we will receive on all sides impartial justice from you.  Now, I am speaking of the administration of the Dail, of which, presumably, you are in charge. Can this Dail assume that the administration will be conducted by you impartially&mdash;the ordinary administration? 
     
    
      
       The Dail may be assured that any administration under my authority will be impartially conducted. 
     
    
      
       May I ask whether you will reply to me, please?  I have not signed the roll, and I am willing to do so if this is a Parliament for the whole of Ireland; otherwise not. 
     
    
      
       The Dail has been constituted and the Chairman elected, and Deputies who have signed the roll have the right to speak; Deputies who have not signed the roll have not the right to speak. 
     
    
      
       They do not want to speak. 
     
    
      
       Very well. 
     
     
    
      
       They don't want to speak. 
     
    
      
       This summons is to the Dail for the whole of Ireland, and I am unable to solve these other problems. 
     
    
      
       Will any member of the six counties be allowed to sit in this. Dail? 
     
    
      
       It is my pamful duty to move that this gentleman be excluded from the House.  Only members who have signed the roll have the right to appear here. 
     
    
      
       I want to know&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       Everyone recognises what his position is, and what his responsibility is, and what this Parliament is. 
     
    
      
       No.  Is it Dail Eireann? 
     
    
      
       You are not entitled to speak here since you have not signed the roll. 
     
    
      
       I have been elected to Dail Eireann.  Are my constituents to be disfranchised by you, sir? 
     
    
      
       By yourself. 
     
    
      
       I ask you to exercise your authority in the Chair.  This is not a baby show. 
     
    
      
       I have been referred to the Chair and I want to leave quietly. If this is Dail Eireann I am bound to sit here.  Will you not answer the question? You promised to be impartial. 
     
    
      
       To members of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       Is this Dail Eireann or is it not?  You began by shifty conduct. I am prepared to sign the roll if this is Dail Eireann. 
     
    
      
       The motion is that the gentleman who has not signed the roll be and is hereby removed. 
     
    
      
       I began by testing your fairness; you begin by shifting. 
       The motion was put and declared carried. 
     
    
      
       The motion, is declared carried, and the gentleman must be removed from the House. 
     
     
    
      
       Is this Dail Eireann or not?  Is it Dail Eirearm for the whole of Ireland, or is it a Partition Parliament? 
       
         Mr. Ginnell was then requested to leave by one of the officials. 
       
     
    
      
       You have to begin your proceedings by expelling a member. 
     
    
      
       It has been done. 
     
    
      
       Then this is a Partition Parliament.  I am a member of Dail Eireann.  Take care about expelling me. 
       Having been again requested to retire by an official Mr. Ginnell again asked: Do you expel a member of Dail Eireann?  Do you expel by force a member of the Dail? 
     
    
      
       Mr. Ginnell has not signed the roll of this Parliament, and therefore cannot be in this Parliament. 
     
    
      
       I want to sign the roll.  If it is a Partition Parliament I do not want to do so.  Am I allowed to sign as a member of Dail Eireann? You have promised fair play.  Your position in the chair entitles us to fair play. 
     
    
      
       The motion has been carried that the person interrupting be removed.  I see no other method of conducting the business. 
     
    
      
       I am being put out. 
       
         Mr. Ginnell was then conducted from the precincts of the House. 
       
     
    
      
       The next business of the Dail will be the election of An Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We will now receive nominations for the post of An Leas-Cheann Comhairle. 
     
    
      
       proposed Padraic O Maille. 
     
    
      
       seconded. 
     
    
      
       It is proposed by Deputy P. Beasley, and seconded by Deputy de Roiste, that the name of Padraic O Maille be accepted as An Leas-Cheann Comhairle. 
       There were no other nominations. 
     
    
      
       If there are no other nominations I may take it that the name of Padraic O Maille as An Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been   accepted.  I therefore declare Padraic O Maille elected An Leas-Cheann Comhairle. 
     
    
      
       Gabhaim buidheachas libh i dtaobh gur toghadh mise chun na Leas-Chathaoireach.  An fhaid a bhead-sa sa Leas-Chathaoir tugaim gealluint dibh go dtabharfa me ceart do gach einne anso. 
     
   
   
     ELECTION OF PRESIDENT. 
    
      
       The next business on the Agenda is the election of President of the Dail, and we will now-receive nominations for that position. 
     
    
      
       Before nominations are received may we hear from you what the intention is regarding proceedings generally; what are the functions of the President of the Dail, and whether we shall receive any declaration of policy or reports of the past conduct of the Government before these officers are elected, and generally a statement regarding intentions for the future? 
     
    
      
       It is tor the Dail itself to determine temporarily its own procedure.  I see upon the Agenda here the appointment of a Committee to draw up Standing Orders which would determine the procedure.  Some temporary measure must be adopted. That is for the Dail. 
     
    
      
       For what period is the President of the Dail to be elected, because the conduct of the past business of the country and the prospects of the future business will have some effect on the decision of the Dail as to who maybe elected President? 
     
    
      
       That can be discussed on the motion for the election of President. 
     
    
      
       In reference to the election of President and the Ministry&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       There is nothing before the Dail at present except the matter of procedure. 
     
    
      
       I thought you were going on to the election of President. 
     
    
      
       No. Until we get this question of procedure adopted I would suggest that we temporarily   adopt the Standing Orders of Dail Eireann. 
     
    
      
       Temporarily, I take it, until the others are agreed upon. 
     
    
      
       Precisely. That is my suggestion. 
     
    
      
       Can copies of the Standing Orders be made available? 
     
    
      
       Copies can be available for the Dail, but only a limited number, I am afraid. 
     
    
      
       I can facilitate with one copy, if that is of any use to the Dail. 
     
    
      
       Will you permit me to move formally that for the temporary business of the Dail we adopt the old Standing Orders until new Standing Orders are adopted? 
     
    
      
       I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that we should understand before going to No. 7 what is the intention of the Ministry of the Provisional Government in regard to giving information to the Dail as to the course of affairs in the immediate past, or its intentions in regard to the future?  It seems to me that we should understand at what point in the proceedings of the Dail we are to be informed as to policy, and receive reports as to past conduct. 
     
    
      
       I think that will arise more properly when the motion for the Standing Orders has been dealt with.  That question can be put on Question 5. 
     
    
      
       A Chinn Chomhairle, is it not clear that this Parliament has to elect an Executive, and is it not clear when this Executive is elected that the responsibility will be on it of deciding what its policy is, and if that policy is not such as will give the Dail confidence, the Executive elected will have to change it, but until the Executive is selected there can be no statement of policy. 
     
    
      
       Ma's fior do Risteard O Maolchatha, caide mar is feidir le Teachtai guthanna a thabhairt d'iarratoiri gan 'fhios aca an bhfuil clar oibre ceaptha ag an Aireacht ata ag teacht isteach?  If&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       Nuair a bheidh ainm duine eigin os comhair na   Dala beidh cead ag gach teachta an sgeal a chur tre cheile. 
     
    
      
       Might I ask those Members who are qualified to speak Irish and who also speak in English to give us who do not speak Irish an opportunity of knowing what is going on.  It is not fair that the questions asked, in Irish should be answered by you in Irish only. 
     
    
      
       I think that question properly arises when you are framing the Standing Orders. 
     
    
      
       I want to know what is the business on the agenda at the moment?  Is it the question, of Standing Orders or the election, of a President of the Dail? 
     
    
      
       It is the question of adopting temporary Standing Orders. 
     
    
      
       I think there is a misunderstanding on the point.  The Standing Orders may arise shortly, but there is a proposal on the Orders of the day that there shall be elected a President of the Dail.  The new Members do not know what that means.  We assume it means the Head of the Government, but we do not know how long that office shall be held by the holder.  It is essential that we should have an opportunity of hearing from the present or prospective Head of the Government on what ground we are expected to elect any particular person to that office.  If you rule&mdash;and perhaps this may clear the way&mdash;that on the nomination of any particular person we may discuss questions of policy past or in future, then the matter will be clear.  I suggest that that is the orderly way of going about this business. 
     
    
      
       I want to supplement what has been said by the last speaker.  Up to now we have been working upon what they call in America an inter-looking directorate.  Will the President elected here be Chairman of the Provisional Government?  Will the Ministers elected here be the Provisional Government.  If not, what will their relations be? 
     
    
      
       There is no business really before the Dail, therefore I will now take nominations on No. 5.  The question may arise afterwards, and may be addressed to the President elect. 
     
     
    
      
       After he is elected? 
     
    
      
       Not necessarily. 
     
    
      
       Would I be in order in moving that whoever be put forward as President be riot put forward as President of the Dail, but as President of the Council of Ministers.  I thhik you yourself are President of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       I am not President of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       You are presiding over the Dail with great distinction. 
     
    
      
       That question does not arise now, but when the motion is put we may consider possible amendments. 
     
    
      
       Molaim don Dail seo go dtoghfar Liam MacCosgair mar Uachtaran ar an nDail. On uair do bhi cruinniu againn cheana do cailleadh an bheirt fhear ab fhearr a bhi againn&mdash;beirt do bhi os ar gcionn ar feadh abhfad agus do shaoileamair a bheadh 'nar measg go ceann abhfad eile.

Nuair iarraim ar an nDail Liam MacCosgair do thogha iarraim ortha fear do thogha a dheanfaidh an obair. 
       Ta orrainn an t-Arm do chosaint agus a chuid oibre do cho-liona.  Ta orrainn e do chosaint o namhaide iasachta agus o namhaide ata 'nar measg, no o dhaoine ata 'na ndroch-chairde don tir seo. 
     
     With a view to meeting the wishes which have been expressed here and until tho Standing Orders are settled, let me say in English I propose to this Dail the election of Liam MacCosgair as President of the Dail. Since the last Dail separated we have   lost the two people who were the leaders, and to whom we looked, as the leaders of the future&mdash;one of them the greatest sower who lived in Ireland while we have been here, and the other the greatest reaper the country has ever had.  Now in this country, without these two great leaders, we are faced with greater responsibilities thrown upon each particular Member of this Dail, and very great responsibilities indeed thrown, upon certain Members who have to undertake the work which would have been taken up by the two great Chiefs whom we have lost.  The life of this Dail is understood to be a short one, as lives of Parliaments go.  We have a certain definite work to do; we have first and foremost to implement the Treaty that was made recently between this Country and Britain, and made by, among others, those two Chieftains whom we have lost.  We have to set up a Constitution for our Country that will be in accordance with that Treaty, and we have in the meantime to perform the work of governing the Country.  The implementing of this Treaty will save our Country from outside enemies, and we have here in this Dail to discuss and to arrange and to settle and to carry out means for defeating internal enemies, or very, very bad friends of our Country, whereby the National strength that lay in our Army has been seriously broken. That strength has been recovered.  The National Party that was the strength of the work of the past few years too has been broken, but a sufficiently large section of it still holds together, and the ties that bound the Country and the whole of that Party, before it was broken, still exist, between, the Country and the greater portion, of what they would call that great National Party. The responsibility of shouldering the greater portion of the work of the immediate future is being shouldered by that Party, if I could call it a Party, considering its history.  We have left to us a very great national responsibility, a national duty, to see that that National Party shall strengthen itself, shall solidify and recover its old national strength, to pull the Country through this crisis in the same way as the broken Party has pulled itself together and stood by the liberties of the Country in its own particular crisis.  And in proposing Mr. Cosgrave, as head of the   new Government, I propose him as a man who is the trusted head of that National Party, and I propose him as being in himself a man of sufficient strength of character to carry forward the work we place before him of securing the full freedom that is brought to us under this Treaty, and to carry out the work of implementing it, and of shouldering all the other great responsibilities. That work requires very great courage, very great tact, and very, very many other great qualities, to save our Country from those at any rate very, very bad friends of the Country who are endeavouring, with whatever motives, to destroy a, very big portion of that freedom which their own particular efforts helped us to get, not so very long ago. 
    
      
       I second the resolution for the election of Mr. Cosgrave as President of the Dail.  The position which he occupies is known to all the Members here.  He is the leading representative of those on whom the main burden has fallen of carrying out the national policy of the people of Ireland, at present, that is to say, giving effect to the Treaty of last December.  In proposing him for the Presidentship we speak of the Members of this Assembly in general.  While we are undoubtedly placing him in the highest position which it is possible to occupy in the civil life of Ireland, we are, at the same time, imposing on him the heaviest burden that it is possible to impose on any person in the civil life of Ireland at the present, and we cannot conceal it from ourselves.  My view of the Irish Government, under present conditions, or under any future conditions, is that no matter what its condition may be, when it becomes the Irish Government it is not the Government of a party, it is the Government of the nation; it is responsible to all sections of the nation, and that every party, every section, has an equal right to exercise its influence, its controlling influence, its, criticising influence upon the Government; and that, at the same time, the Government, when it is doing what is necessary under the circumstances for the good of the nation, is entitled to the co-operation and to the support of all parties without distinction. We know there can be no mystery about it how Mr. Cosgrave comes to be proposed to you.  Upon him naturally, in   the course of events, devolved the responsibility of taking up the burden of being Chairman of a Government after the blank created by the death of Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins; and that being so, his name naturally comes before you at this juncture as the right and proper person to be elected to the Presidency of the Dail. 
       Mar sin taim ag cuidiu leis an run. 
     
    
      
       Ta abhar ruin os coir na Dala go dtoghfar Liam T. MacCosgair mar Uachtaran ar an nDail. Do thairg Risteard O Maolchatha e agus d'aontuigh Eoin MacNeill leis.  (There is a Resolution before the Dail that W. T. Cosgrave be chosen as President of the Dail, proposed by Mr. Mulcahy and seconded by Professor MacNeill). 
     
    
      
       I take it that the promise you gave to the Deputy and the introductory speech of the mover of the resolution indicates that this is the occasion to make some reference to public policy and even to a declaration of policy on the part of those who occupy the Ministerial benches, and who are expected to occupy the Ministerial benches in future.  Alderman Cosgrave is being proposed for a very onerous office indeed &mdash;perhaps the most onerous that any man in Ireland's history ever occupied. He assured us a few moments ago that he was not a child in those matter; that we need not make suggestions, because they were not children.  I didn't think he quite meant that, but I could not help but think that it was obvious that he, with his experience, was not responsible for the rules, procedure, and general conduct of affairs of the last Dail, because of the fact that he is fully conversant and well experienced in all matters of this kind.  Your own assurance covers the position.  I am quite sure that Mr. Cosgrave did not suggest that any member of the Dail was not entitled to make proposals with regard to the due order of the business of the Dail. 
     
     I think, though, everybody is looking for a statement, not upon these somewhat trivial matters&mdash;we speak proportionately &mdash;but upon the general issues that are facing the country to-day.  We on these Benches look upon ourselves rather as the inheritors of a situation&mdash;a constitutional position, if you like&mdash;that has been handed down to us and the country, to   us, at any rate, by the other people who had the confidence of the country in the past; and, as we have stated m another place, we accept the verdict of the country. We take it that the party that had command of affairs, that was given a free hand, pretty well, in the conduct of affairs, did their utmost, and got the most out of the situation, and that their judgment has been accepted by the people.  We feel ourselves not responsible for the present situation, but prepared to acknowledge that our predecessors did their best and, rightly or wrongly, they have handed to this Assembly&mdash;to this political generation&mdash;a heritage which we have to make the most of.  But since the last meeting of the Dail, very many terrible events have happened.  My memory tells me that there was a decision to refer certain vexed questions to a conference.  Conferences were held between Ministerial Members and active Opposition Members, and between Army leaders on the one side and Army leaders on the other side, and it might have been presumed the result of these conferences would have been given to the Dail before any action was taken by the Government of the day.  Up to this the public does not know what the result of these conferences, which they were charged with undertaking by the Dail, was except the eventuality of civil war.  We do not know why they failed, or on whom the responsibility for the failure lies.  All we know is that within a very few days after the Conferences were held, within a very few days after Members of one party were in fraternal relations with members of the other party&mdash;the guns began to speak&mdash;three days before the date fixed for the meeting of the new Dail. We are not going, as far as this group is concerned, to be captious critics of the Government.  We intend to make what we can of this Assembly as an Assembly which will do the business of the country in the best interests of the country.  (Hear, hear.) But when the seconder of the resolution says the duty of the country is to support the Government, when the Government is doing what is necessary in the best interests of the country, he does not indicate who are the best judges of what is necessary.  For a very long time the Government has been allowed to be the judges of what is necessary.  I hope the Government will be allowed to do many things.  They will have to be allowed to do many things in the interim   between one meeting and another&mdash; between one portion of a session and an other.  They will have the responsibility of carrying out the Decrees and the Acts of the Dail.  But I hope it will be understood for the future that the Dail is the master of the Government.  Hitherto, I think, and perhaps necessarily so, in the circumstances of the past few years&mdash;I am not going to stress the criticism too strongly&mdash;perhaps it was necessary in a revolutionary period that the Government should take on itself responsibilities and not be accountable at that period to any Assembly for their acts.  But when that particular portion of the revolutionary period has elapsed it is necessary for an account to be given to the people, and some responsibility taken by the people and the people's representatives for the acts of the Government.  I think it is not enough for the proposal to go before the Chamber.  It is hardly enough for the motion to go for the election of the President of the Dail and then the nomination, presumably by the President, of the Ministry, without knowing something about the mitentions in regard to the future as well as some account of the proceedings in the past.  It seems to me it will not be unreasonable, and it will not interfere with the business of the State, if we have a discussion on this question of policies, past or future, taking place before any vote is taken upon this question.  We would like to know officially and authoritatively what the intentions of the Government are in regard to the discussions on the Constitution. We would like to know what the views of the Government are in regard to the powers and authority of this Assembly. We would like to know from the Ministerial benches what their intentions are in regard to the conduct of war-like operations in the country.  Are we to assume that the Propaganda Department is speaking officially and with authority when it utters the Die-hard pronouncements which remind one more of the  Morning Post  or of Sir Hamar Greenwood in the pre-Truce days than of an Irish Ministry.  We would like to know whether these pronouncements, coming from the Publicity Department presumably&mdash;certainly from the Propaganda Department of the Party which is acknowledging the Ministry&mdash;are official pronouncements or whether they really embody the considered intentions of the Ministry.  We read phrases, which to   those who have experience of the North of Ireland are very reminiscent of July 12th orations in the North&mdash;&ldquo;dying in the last ditch,&rdquo;&ldquo;No surrender,&rdquo;&ldquo;No peace until the last gun and the last cartridge have been surrendered.&rdquo; We know if we are willing to face realities that that kind of proposal is not going to be given effect to.  We may pretend that there is the intention, but let us face realities; we know that we are not going to be able to disarm these people.  If we are willing to face the fact no one will deny, least of all those who took part in the active operations of the last four years, that that is the situation.  Is there no way in which a word can be uttered from the Ministerial benches which will give some kind of a hope to the country that something less than grinding in the dust is going to satisfy the Powers that be and the Powers that hope to be ?  We have taken the view that the situation that faces the country arises from a different interpretation of the promises, the undertakings, the pledges, that men gave, and of the temperaments of those men.  Those who had the privilege of attending the meetings of the Dail during the Treaty debates know that the great majority of those who voted for the Treaty, the great majority of the positive and active minds of the country who had helped in the agitation that resulted in the Treaty, accepted the Treaty, not as a satisfaction of their claims for National Independence, but as the best that could be obtained as a result of that particular effort, as something that was being accepted by the people under protest; as something short of their legitimate demand&mdash; that it was the best that could be obtained at that time.  I wonder whether it is possible to extract from the Ministerial benches the confirmation of that view of the intention of the Majority Party?  No one who claims the right of Self-determination will assert that that has been conceded in the Treaty, and I am throwing out the suggestion that a way may be found&mdash; I do it entirely on my own responsibility-to peace in this country, if this threat of war to the last cartridge is not going to be undertaken and that the country accepts the present situation as something very definitely short of its rightful demands.  I say that undoubtedly represents the minds   of the masses of the people.  I believe if we are going to be Masters in this Country, if we are going to be Masters of the future destinies of this Country, that we are to have actively in support of these Institutions the minds of the real democracy who are prepared to stand by the ideals of liberty and in the past also stood by those ideals.  We might also like to have an expression of opinion from the Ministry as to whether they have given encouragement to the suggestions that are very rife, that the powers of Government should be entrusted in some degree, to new people, meaning, of course, old people; to a new set of Governors, meaning, of course, old Governors.  We would like to know whether it is in the mind of the Ministry that we are going to revert to the position of having a new name with the old bodies with all the implications, social, commercial and industrial that that connotes?  Are we going to stand on the protestations or professions of the past few years that the new Ireland would be a bigger Ireland and that democracy would not be merely a political democracy, but have some relation to the social combinations, the social authorities, the social relations generally of man and man?  We all hoped that the new Ireland would mean a country in which the cash relations would be minimised, and human, relations magnified-that the motto would be service and co-operation rather than the commercial ideals that have made England great.  We would like to have assurances on these points.  We on these benches would perhaps welcome more than anything else a reassertion from this Dail of the implication and intentions of the democratic programme of Dail Eireann.  I would ask that the discussion might continue to an extent that we might get an authoritative expression from the Ministry as to their attitude to the future of these questions, and perhaps, most of all, the great question that is affecting those for whoin we are closely in contact and for whom we are specially speaking.  We know when we are speaking of unemployment, we will be told that the political and military situation is responsible, and we have no answer to that to a great extent; but this problem of unemployment that faces numbers of the people is a problem that existed before the outbreak of the present trouble.  The present Ministry and   the previous Ministry have known of the problem and presumably have been considering remedies that they would like to apply.  We would like to have some indication of what their views are on that question, because we are coming to a winter which will probably be the most severe winter&mdash;quite apart from the military situation&mdash;of any winter we have passed through for quite a long, long time. We are not going to get through this winter without considerable commotion, if I can read the signs of the times aright&mdash;quite apart from the military situation&mdash;unless the Ministry is going to lead the country and say what was promised definitely in the democratic programme of Dail Eireann, that anyone willing to work was to be assured of an opportunity of working.  Can we have an assurance from the Ministry that that is their policy, that that is their intention? If we can the way may be eased. We may possibly find many ways of collaborating and assisting.  If I might say so, coming back to the War problem, that problem, too, will be greatly eased indeed, but for this menace of unemployment and the danger that men would be brought out of the fighting areas to starve on the streets, on the roads and countrysides.  We would like a declaration of policy on these matters, and I think you and the Dail generally are willing to allow the discussion to proceed for some time before a vote is taken, as it might facilitate the business of the Dail. 
    
      
       Now that the election of President has been carried out, I would like to know what has become of the Collins-De Valera pact, and by whom was it broken?  Of course it will be in the memory of some people that this agreement was entered into, and as one of the persons present and a party to that agreement I would like to know what has become of that pact, who has broken it?  If it is this side then I could not take any part in the election of President.  I would also wish to know if the Ministry that is being appointed, whether it is to be a Coalition Ministry, and if not, why not?  I notice a gentleman in the Ministry smiling, but this is a very serious matter to me.  This was a matter of public faith, an agreement publicly entered into before the Nation. It is a very serious matter and I assure all present that the Nation is looking on,   some people seem to think they are not. I would like the President elected to refer to this matter as it is a question I want to be enlightened on myself.  The other points referred to by the Labour Members are matters I wish to hear explained, as it will decide my future policy.

       I would like to ask the President to state definitely whether he proposes on election to unify the present system of dual government? 
     
    
      
       Perhaps it would not be out of place at this stage, with reference to the question of the pact, to point out that under the terms of the pact every party was free to go up for election: I would like to know who or what party attacked representatives of the Farmers' Party.  I am one of those who were attacked. We were attacked with revolvers and machine guns.  Perhaps that is an answer to Mr. O'Rourke.  Who was the Party who did that?

       Before the motion is put I suggest that the questions that Deputy Johnson has asked here should be answered.  I think all the questions he has asked are of the greatest moment, and require an answer.  The question of unemployment has been touched upon.  It is perfectly clear to me that what is called military warfare is to an extent the result of a large amount of unemployment in the country. I see no programme before the Dail for dealing with this, and I think the President should give us a statement of his policy before elected.  I think that is the point Deputy Johnson wants to make, and I emphasise it strongly. 
     
    
      
       That question is, I presume, directed to the person who is to be elected President? I have no power in the matter, except to allow reasonable discussion. 
     
    
      
       Some of the questions dealt with by Mr. Johnson refer to the Constitution.  Now, we are not discussing the Constitution.  There are also questions directed to the Executive, but we have yet no Executive.  It has not even been nominated.  A lot of these   questions are premature, and they cannot be answered because the Executive has not been elected.  First go on with the election of President.  When the President and Executive are elected, they will, no doubt, reply. 
     
    
      
       I wonder you did not think of that before you introduced the question of machine guns and revolvers. 
     
    
      
       The last speaker has said that some of the questions are rather premature and deal with matters some distance ahead.  I think some of us hope that some of the questions raised will be dealt with a little ahead.  That one, for instance, dealing with the Constitution.  There are far more urgent and important questions before the country at present than even the Constitution.  We  must have answers to certain of the questions before the election because the President will nominate the Ministers who form the Executive, and how could anybody vote for a President or members of Executive before that President had declared the policy his Ministers would pursue ?  There has been a certain amount of propaganda, and that propaganda has been contributed to by members of this Dail, to the effect that the business of this Dail is, to some extent, to be confined to dealing with certain documents, and not to dealing with the big life and death issues before the country at the present moment.  In my opinion, the first thing the Dail should address itself to is the question of civil war.  Hundreds and thousands of people up and down the country are faced with starvation.  And there are other questions.  For instance, we want to get a definite answer from the Deputy nominated as President of the new Executive now about coming into power whether they are going to conduct war or police operations.  If they are going to conduct war, we all know where we are.  We know that war measures and finance will be called for, and that all the restrictions that accompany war will be called for.  If this is to be a police operation, if we are going to have Constitutionalism, let us have a police operation, and not an operation which nobody can say is either a war or a police measure.  There are hundreds,   perhaps thousands, of non-combatants, civilians, who are in jails and in barracks, who have been arrested without authority, without any investigation or trial or intention of trial, or anything like that.  Some of us, as far back as April, had occasion to go to heads of the last Executive to put a number of questions to them.  One question we had to put at the time was whether there was a code of Army regulations which would govern the discipline of the Army.  We were told then that there was no such code of regulations.  Regulations between the civilian population and the Army should be defined, so that soldiers and officers should know their places and duties, and the civilians know their places and duties.  These are questions requiring definition.  You are getting from day to day into a state of chaos.  You have been getting into that condition for the last few months.  Largely the reason is that no one has sat down and thought these things out and the proper way to deal with them.  It is for the President and Executive to deal with those questions. The Executive has the power of life and death over the whole population of Ireland. We must know, therefore, what is the policy of that Executive on these questions; otherwise, of course, we will be only getting into greater chaos.  We want to know the relations between the Army and the Government.  We do not know what are the relations between the new Executive and the Army, or whether the Army forces in the country are going to be responsible to this Dail or not. These are the questions we want a reply to from the Executive.  Another thing I want to stress which has been raised by Deputy Johnson, and it was hinted at elsewhere by a Teachta who is an old and respected worker in the National movement for many years, though we differ now, and that is that there is a certain minimising of the power and authority of this Dail. We do not want to indulge in captious criticism, but there are statements being made that this Dail will not have anything like extended powers of legislation; that it will be only to a certain extent a Constituent Assembly.  Our view is that it has very considerable powers of legislation, and we want to know if that is the conception which the Executive has about it.

       I would like to say a few words, but I do not propose to make an electioneering speech.  If elected to this position it is my intention to implement the Treaty&mdash;as sanctioned by the vote of the Dail and the Electorate, in so far as it was free to express an opinion, to enact a Constitution, to assert the authority and supremacy of Parliament, to support and assist the National Army in asserting the people's rights, to ask Parliament, if necessary, for such powers as are deemed essential for the purpose of restoring order and to suppress all crimes, to expedite as far as lies in the power of the Government the return of normal conditions throughout the country, and having established Saorstat on a constitutional basis, to speed the work of reconstruction and reparation. 
     
    
      
       The motion before the Dail is that Mr. W. T. Cosgrave be chosen as President of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       In view of the very unsatisfactory answer given by the nominated President to this Dail, we shall have to vote against his election, and with great regret. 
       The motion was carried. 
     
    
      
       I have now to thank the Dail for the very great honour that has been conferred on me, and to say that, with the help of God, I shall carry out the duties of the office to the best of my ability. 
     
   
   
     FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 
    
      
       The next business on the Agenda is the nomination of the Ministry by the President. 
     
    
      
       Before proceeding to the nomination of the Ministry, I may here say that the Government is prepared to set aside Monday for the discussion of most of the questions raised by Deputy Johnson and Deputy O'Shannon.  According to the rules of the Constitution of Dail Eireann I now nominate the Ministry.  I beg to nominate for the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Desmond Fitzerald. 
     
     
    
      
       I take it that proposals from the President forming his Ministry do not require to be seconded. 
     
    
      
       No. 
     
    
      
       I should like before this is put. to the vote to make one or two things. clear.  I tried just now to extract a piece of information perfectly innocently. 
     
    
      
       I should have explained to the Deputy that the two Governments are to be assimilated. 
     
    
      
       It would reassure me somewhat if certain statements which have been made broadcast&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       On what question is this. 
     
    
      
       It is on the question of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  There  is an idea-if it be denied I will accept the denial from the new Minister, for one is anxious in every way possible to support the Government&mdash;that there is a section of opinion&mdash;official or semi-official&mdash; which desires to see our foreign affairs damped down or closed down.  I should like Mr. Fitzgerald to assure us&mdash;before he is elected&mdash;that there is no intention to do any such thing, and that we may count upon our foreign relations being kept alive during the years of his office. 
     
    
      
       I understood this was to be a personal explanation. 
     
    
      
       This is a question affecting the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I propose at the earliest possible moment to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to tell the House what is the policy of the Government with regard to the League of Nations, and trust it will be satisfactory.  Personally, I think it is deplorable that our Delegates are not in Geneva now.  I will say no more about that, but I think it is a matter of most urgent importance in the National interest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should take a definite line of action with regard to Ireland's admission into the League of Nations. 
     
    
      
       With all respect, I say a great many knotty points have been raised here to-day which I certainly cannot follow.  Has the   President the power to appoint his own Ministry, or is it within the power of the Dail to appoint his Ministry over him? 
     
    
      
       The President nominates his Ministry for the approval of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       If the Dail does not sanction the nominations of the President, where do we stand? 
     
    
      
       That will be a matter for the President himself.  Is not that right? 
     
    
      
       Yes. 
     
    
      
       I take it the Dail approves of the appointment of Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald. 
       Approved. 
     
   
   
     HOME AFFAIRS. 
    
      
       The next nomination is that of Minister for Home Affairs. 
     
    
      
       I beg to nominate Mr. Kevin O'Higgins for this office. 
     
    
      
       Mr. Kevin O'Higgins has been nominated as Minister for Home Affairs.  I take it his name meets with the approval of the Dail. 
       Approved. 
     
   
   
     LOCAL GOVERNMENT. 
    
      
       I beg to nominate Mr. Ernest Blythe for the office of Minister for Local government. 
     
    
      
       I take it the name of Mr. Blythe as Minister for local Government is approved? 
       Approved. 
     
   
   
     MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE. 
    
      
       I beg to nominate Mr. Patrick Hogan for the office of Minister for Agriculture. 
     
    
      
       Do I take it this proposal has the approval of the Dail? 
       Approved. 
     
   
   
     INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE. 
    
      
       I beg to nominate Mr. McGrath as Minister for Industry   and Commerce, which will absorb the Ministry of Labour and Economics. 
     
    
      
       I may say I stand absolutely in support of everything necessary to maintain the Government in office until it carries through its work, but I do not think that appointments which may lead to inefficiency are likely to sustain them in office.  I may say that I am not making any adverse criticism of the Minister suggested-I think he has done excellent work, but I do think it is bad business from the point of view of the State to merge these two great offices under one head.  These in normal times are of vital importance in the national life.  Each of them would require the full time and attention of a very able head.  Now, we must face facts. One of the facts we have to face to-day is that our new administrators are, at the best, not much better than raw amateurs.  I say that without meaning any disrespect, for, I think, as amateurs they have achieved great work for the nation; but, my judgement, it would require a superman to give the attention necessary to both these Departments at the present time.  Now, Mr. McGrath has given evidence of great ability, but he certainly is not a superman.  My opinion is this, that if you merge two large and important Departments such as these under one head it is going to lead to Departmental inefficiency and Departmental confusion. The Heads of the Departments will not be able to do that which in my judgment is essential for the service of the nation at the present time.  It is something more than merely taking over control of a Department&mdash;something more than acting as the nominal Head of a Department.  They have to grasp every detail of the administration of the Department and import into these Departments the force and the influence of their own personalities.  I say one of these Departments is enough for men who are new to administration to discharge efficiently, and I say that the merging of two of these great Departments under one head is not giving the head of those Departments a fair chance, and the result will be you will be unable to cope with the control and development of those Departments, and the Civil Servants taken over under the old regime will take control and run these Departments. It is not fair to the Ministry,   and it is a false step on the part of the Government, and they should seriously consider whether or not a revision of these two Departments should be made, and the Departments severed&mdash;or at least placed under separate heads&mdash;in order to secure that the vital life of the nation shall get due service.  Remember after all that the people at the head of these Departments have no particular need to worry about the police measures that are being engaged in to quell the disturbances in the country.  There is no reason why the formulating of an economic social policy should be held up until the end of these disturbances.  I think those in charge of these great Departments of national life, if their work is held up for the time being, they should be thinking out and planning and arranging the basis of a policy of economic progress that will come into operation when these disturbances have ceased.  If you place a man at the head of two large Departments, you will be unable to develop such a policy of social and economic progress. I want to make my position, perfectly clear.  I am saying this now in a spirit of help and not in a spirit of acrimonious criticism.  If the two Departments had been severed I should not have said a word, but I think it is a fatal blunder to have them merged.  I think it is right, especially, that members of this Dail should speak their minds, and those who support the Government should tell the Government when they believe that something is being done that is not the best thing.  I do not want to press this to a division, but I do want to urge on the Government, and on the Ministry, and on the President, to consider this matter seriously. The Ministry of Trade and Commerce and the Ministry of Labour are two of the most vital Departments of the nation's life.  Upon the efficient administration of these two Departments the progress and social stability of the nation's immediate Future are going to depend.  They are the two Departments of the nation which require efficient service and clear sound brainwork.  The merging of them is creating a situation where it is almost impossible to secure that efficient service to the nation.  Therefore I want to ventilate this criticism of mine upon that point. 
     
     
    
      
       There are Ministers who, I understand, hold positions in the Army.  They are being nominated to-day.  I want to ask are they going to hold these dual positions.  I think that ought to be taken into consideration as well as what Deputy Milroy states. 
     
    
      
       That is a matter for the President to answer. 
     
    
      
       Do I answer that now or at the end? 
     
    
      
       It would be perhaps better to answer it at the end of the discussion. 
     
    
      
       Mr. Chairman, at the recent election, one of the things upon which insistent emphasis was laid was the need of a strong Government; and in the interval since the election we have lost, according to speakers to-day, two of the most important Members of the Government that existed heretofore.  Now are we to understand that the method of giving, the country a strong Government is to diminish the Ministries?  There are in the proposal just made by the President of An Dail two things, one a proposal, a very serious one, to abolish a Ministry by coalescence with another.  That is conjoined with the proposition that one individual do fill the two.  I would like to suggest as a matter of procedure that we be allowed to debate the first.  I agree absolutely with Deputy Milroy that there are no more important Departments, except perhaps Education, than the Department of Labour and the Department of Trade.  It seems to me, with all respect to the President, that rather we should prefer to multiply than to unify Ministries.  The Cabinet must not be sectional.  We are here representing not sections but the entire people.  We profess that we are the expression of the people's will as registered in the recent elections.  It seems to me that a strong Government could be better secured if, instead of reducing the Ministries, the number should be fixed so as to include the best ability of the country.  At the present moment the country is passing through a very dangerous strait; it needs all the help and all the guidance and all the loyal support it can receive from every section of the community; and it is putting an undue strain on the loyalty of those who   were not Members of the last Dail, to expect them fully to acquiesce in arrangements of the reasons for which they have, absolutely, no knowledge.  I for one think it necessary, as Deputy Milroy has done, to express the criticism which occurs to me as a criticism necessary at this juncture, without in any way intending to hamper the work of the Government.  As regards affairs which it is imperatively necessary to carry through with urgency and o despatch there is nothing so necessary, at the present moment, as attention to all that complex of problems which are usually termed Labour problems.  Unless we can secure that there is a Department devoting concentrated energy and the highest ability to these questions, there is danger that we simply drift into a war policy, leaving everything else lagging behind.  I would like the President, therefore, to give us an opportunity of debating his proposal to merge those Ministries rather than to tempt us to adopt this thing through any unwillingness to vote against his nominee. 
     
    
      
       I would like to say just a few words on this subject. I have been Minister for Economic Affairs of the Provisional Government.  The name is, perhaps, somewhat grandiose. The Provisional Government did not select it originally, but it was selected by the ex-President of Dail Eireann, and the idea was that, in forming a small War Cabinet, a post should be found for Mr. Barton, who at that time was lately released from Portland.  Mr. Barton spoke for the Departments of Trade, Commerce, Agriculture, and Labour. The heads of those Departments were excluded from the inner Cabinet.  Now there is talk here of cutting down Ministries. In fact, there was a Ministry of Trade and Commerce of Dail Eireann, and there was this Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Provisional Government, to which to a large extent it was an amplification.  That was due to the peculiar position at the time, and the dual control which a great many people, including ourselves, found awkward.  It has been said that there was enough work for a separate Labour Ministry.  It was strange that this very proposal came up at about the same time from the experts of the Labour Department and the   Ministry of Economics without any consultation between the two, because there was overlapping.  It was impossible to take an all-round view of the conditions of the country without coming up against the wages question and other important problems, and it will be admitted that there is a very real and close connection between the development of industry and unemployment.  The Labour Department should not be a mere strike-settling department.  It should not be  a question of dealing out doles.    It should be a question, of seeing to the two needs&mdash;the need of providing work for the unemployed and the need for developing to the full all the resources of the country. It is in that spirit that the change wae made.  The view is that one big economic department corresponding to the British Board of Trade is the ideal way of facing the social problems that confront us&mdash;the problem of unemployment and the problem also of developing the resources of the country.  I believe that one able man with such ability as Mr. McGrath had shown will be very well able to run that Department, and that those proposals, so far from making for looseness or inefficiency, will secure that the best possible attention will be devoted to these questions. 
     
    
      
       Lest the silence of our Members might be misinterpreted, I desire to say that the Labour Members favour this proposed change.  They think it a desirable change.  We think that the Labour Department ought not to be confined to the settling of strikes; that the having of a separate Labour Ministry is following the English model, and in this respect, as well as others, it is not desirable. 
     
    
      
       Regarding the position of the Members of the Government being in the Army, we hope to be able to get Mr. McGrath away from the Army very shortly.  He has given us a good deal of his time as it is.  We hope to be able to get him back there shortly.  I think, with one other exception, the Minister for Defence, there was not any other Member of the Government in the Army. 
     
    
      
       I did not refer particularly to Deputy McGrath when I spoke about dual positions.  I think it very undesirable that any of your Ministers   now being nominated should continue to hold positions in the Army. 
     
    
      
       On a point of information, may I ask whether the Minister for Home Affairs who is nominated is still to be connected with the Army?  This is on the general question of Army officers.  The President has just said &ldquo;with the exception of one other Minister,&rdquo; whom I presume will be the Minister for Defence. 
     
    
      
       The President has said that with the exception of one other Minister, who is the Minister for Defence, there are no other Ministers. 
     
    
      
       Is that the President's reply? 
     
    
      
       There is no other meaning of the words used by the President. 
     
    
      
       Is it the fact? 
     
    
      
       It is. 
       The Dail approved of Mr. McGrath's nomination. 
     
   
   
     MINISTER FOR EDUCATION. 
    
      
       I beg to nominate Professor MacNeill as Minister for Education. 
       Approved. 
     
   
   
     MINISTER FOR DEFENCE. 
    
      
       nominated as Minister for Defence, General Mulcahy. 
     
    
      
       I do not want to take up the attitude of the bull in the china shop, but I must say I do believe in taking up a position of independent criticism in regard to these things.  I think this is one of the most important appointments at the present time, for this reason, we are fighting a War in Ireland which is caused by the defiance by a Military minority of the Civil Majority of the Nation.  The one principle that we are forced at the moment to give attention in Ireland to, is the great principle that the civil authority must be superior to military forces of any kind, whether military forces on our own side that we have to use through our Army, or any movement, revolution, or social disturbance, attempted by military forces within the Nation.  Here we have a proposal to have the one man in control of both the Army and of the civil measures   that have to be taken.  The administration of the Army involves an enormous amount of routine work that results from the present state of things in the country. I do not believe any man at the present time can do all these things as efficiently by holding two or more positions as if he only held one.  I believe, first of all, that the Minister for Defence should be a civilian, in this sense at least, that he should not hold at the same time an Army appointment.  I think that each of the positions held by Mr. Mulcahy should be held by different men.  I think in that way we would certainly get best results for the country, both on the military and administrative side.  It must-be evident to the Dail that an enormous amount of work at the present time and for months to come, in connection with administration alone, having regard to the changes from day to day and the unforeseen changes that have to be made, in the routine work of an ordinary department and especially in this department at the present time calls on the time and energy of the man conducting and responsible for the department, making it absolutely impossible for him to devote his whole time to the administration of that department.  The same thing applies to the military side.  Surely it Is necessary for the Commander-in-Chief to devote his whole time to the military side so that the operations may conclude as soon as possible by the military side being successfully earned on with tremendous energy and concentration.  From this point of view it seems to me desirable that the appointment as suggested should be reconsidered, and I hope it will be reconsidered. There has been a considerable amount of change enforced, of course, within the past few months.  I can hardly think of a post that has not been occupied by one or other Member of the Government, both civil and military.  I only want to say, although these appointments may stand, and receive the approval of the Dail, I certainly reserve the right of independent criticism for everything done in that way, and should not certainly consider I was justified in acting in any other way on behalf of the people I have the honour to represent.  Apart from that, no matter how important these Ministries may be or the issues arising in connection with them, I hope that the main business before the Dail,  i.e.,  to wind up in a satisfactory manner the   relations between Ireland and England, to carry the stages of the Treaty through and get the Constitution going, so that we can after that devote our whole attention to the working of the country&mdash;will be attended to.  Until that time comes I shall certainly give every possible, support in every way to sustain the Government in its decision to complete that work, meanwhile criticising as may seem best. 
     
    
      
       I have every confidence in the capacity of Mr. Mulcahy. I believe he could fill the two positions with credit to himself and the country, but I object to any man being Minister for Defence and Commander of the Army at the same time.  The Commander of the Army if he is to command must be a dictator in a certain sense, for that reason I object to the Minister for Defence and the Commander-in-Chief being the same person. 
     
    
      
       I think that indicates the position we occupy in this matter. That the Commander-in-Chief should also be Minister for Defence reminds one too much of General Kitchener and of certain other commanders of armies in other countries, which leads, possibly not in all circumstances, to a dictatorship. I think there is not much reason to think that, in the present circumstances and the present personnel, but it is not a good principle to adopt at the beginning. The Minister for Defence should be Minister for Defence.  The policy to which I object is one that we should not begin now.  But there is another aspect of this appointment that I think we should have some information upon.  And that is, what force is responsible for the keeping of order, and to whom they are responsible. We are quite in the dark, I think, as to the relations of such police as there are in the country and the Minister for Defence.  Is it contemplated that the Civic Guard which is in course of formation&mdash; perhaps in some small degree in active operation&mdash;is that body responsible to the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Minister for Defence?  And is the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Home Affairs the power to order them?  Is it a civilian force or is it a military force?  These are questions that ought to be answered, and it is one added reason why, in our view, the Minister for Defence ought to be a civilian and not a military man.  Or, if we claim that a military man in this   case is a civilian his duties should not be Commander-in-Chief while he is Minister for Defence.  It would facilitate matters and save discussion at another time if we had an explanation as to the relation between the Civil Police and the Military forces, and whether they are responsible to the Minister for Home Affairs or to the Minister for Defence. 
     
    
      
       Another important matter which I should wish to draw attention to, is this&mdash;As I came into this building, a friend of mine stepped out into the road and handed me an important sheet of paper.  It was propaganda conducted by the Irregular forces, who are producing disorder in the country.  I read this document, and found a paragraph in it which referred to a body &ldquo;calling itself the Provisional Government,&rdquo; and then it adds in a bracket &ldquo;really a Military Junta.&rdquo; Now, I am convinced that the Executive which this legislative sets up is not a military junta, and that it will not assume any of the powers of a &ldquo;military junta.&rdquo; And I hope I am equally confident in saying that it will not want to do so.  But it is important that the criticism of this kind made by those who are acting criminally in the country should not be supported by action taken here or taken or permitted to be taken by this Government.  And if you have a Ministry so formed that the Minister for Defence is at one and the same time Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in the Field, I certainly believe that you are presenting people who at the present moment are acting illegally with an argument which they should not be presented with.  The principle should not be permitted in any country in the world where the Commander-in-Chief in the Field should speak in the Legislature, and thereupon become head of a civil department.  If he is asked a question here, in which capacity will he reply?  He will reply, of course, as Minister for Defence, but it will never be forgotten that at that moment he is Commander-in-Chief as well.  So long as the state of the country continues this question will have to be met frequently during the next three or four weeks, and these questions will arise whenever this Dail meets, and I am perfectly sure that he will be too fully detained with his work as Commander-in-Chief to give this Dail the time to answer for his work   in the field to the Civil Legislature. Therefore, I urge the President to see that whoever is Commander-in-Chief should not be also Minister for Defence, and whoever is Minister for Defence should not be Commander-in-Chief&mdash;that these two should be kept separate. 
     
    
      
       The Civic Guard is under Home Affairs.  The Minister for Defence has no control over them nor has the Commander-in-Chief either.  I would like to say that under ordinary circumstances there might be some reason&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       Does that include the C.I.D.? 
     
    
      
       Yes.  Under ordinary circumstances there might be some ground for criticism of one person holding these two appointments.  But at the present time, and under the present circumstances, it is obvious that the gentleman put forward is the person for both appointments.  He has been identified with the Army for many years, and his long and successful Army record has not deprived him of being able to give the Government very valuable assistance in Council.  The mere fact of his duties occupying his time to such an extent as to exclude him from perhaps being present in the Dail during the time it would be sitting, to answer questions in connection with the War, would not, in my opinion, be sufficient justification for nominating to this Chamber another person.  Those of us who have been in the Civil Government only and have no connection with the Army know and appreciate fully the value of the counsel and usefulness of the attendance of the Minister for Defence at our meetings.  Those in the Army also appreciate his value, and the public outside appreciate his value both as Minister for Defence and Commander-in-Chief, and as I have already said, the two positions, although under other circumstances they might possibly be held by different persons, I think it is rather a matter for satisfaction that this Chamber has in the person of General Mulcahy a person able and competent to fill both positions. 
       The nomination of General Mulcahy was approved by the Dail. 
     
   
   
     MINISTER FOR FINANCE. 
    
      
       I nominate myself for the office of Minister for Finance, or   I am keeping it myself for the present. 
       The Dail approved. 
     
    
      
       Can we have any indication when we are going to have a Budget? 
     
    
      
       That question should be addressed to the Minister for Finance. 
     
    
      
       There is one question I would like to suggest to the Dail, that it might be well to have answered.  It might be raised to-morrow in the country.  I notice in the formation of this Ministry the absence of the name of Mr. Duggan. 
     
    
      
       I am not finished yet. 
     
    
      
       I thought you had.  I assumed you had finished. 
     
   
   
     MINISTRY OF POST OFFICE. 
    
      
       I have now to nominate Mr. J.J. Walsh for the position of Postmaster-General, or to the Ministry of the Post Office. 
     
    
      
       I think the Dail ought to have a statement from the Deputy proposed as Postmaster-General regarding the position in the Post Office. We are aware from the Press that there is grave trouble in the Postal Service, and up to this morning no steps had been taken by the Government to avert this trouble.  We would like to have a statement as to what steps the Postmaster-General has taken to deal with, the matter. 
     
    
      
       It is a question that would require the giving of notice to the Postmaster-General. 
     
    
      
       I understand the Postmaster-General met the representatives of the Postal Staffs this morning. If notice were given in connection with this matter on Monday, I think it would be better. 
     
    
      
       The strike is due to take place to-day.  It would be more desirable if we had a statement from Deputy Walsh now. 
     
    
      
       If it is the wish of the Dail to allow Deputy Walsh to speak now, he may do so, but it is not strictly in order.  Is it the desire of the Dail? 
     
    
      
       As a mere matter of curiosity, he ought not to be asked   to make a statement; but if it can contribute to the public good, he can do so. 
     
    
      
       Those are precisely the grounds I had in mind. Does Deputy Walsh desire to make a statement? 
     
    
      
       I do wish to make a statement. 
     
    
      
       The fuller the information before the Dail the better for the Dail surely. 
     
    
      
       In view of the probability of the whole Postal Services being dislocated, it is better to have a statement. 
       The Dail agreed. 
     
    
      
       I welcome the opportunity of making a short statement in order that the Dail may be placed in possession of the situation at the moment.  I do not suppose you will expect me at this stage, in the midst of negotiations, to go back on any of the facts of the past.  It would be well that the steps that have been taken this morning should be intimated to the Dail.  At the instigation of the Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Douglas, both parties to the dispute, the Department, and with the Department certain representatives of the Government on the one hand and the employees on the other, were brought together this morning, and all matters in dispute were pretty fully gone into, and this is the result.  I will read a brief statement: &ldquo;The Conference arranged by the Chairman of the Commission between representatives of the Government and representatives of the principal Postal Unions, took place this morning ai the Government Buildings.  After discussion, the representatives of the Government made the following proposal to the representatives of the Unions: &lsquo;The Government adheres to their position that the reductions in wages must take place, but they are willing to spread the reductions in instalments over a period of three months, the precise amount of the instalments to be settled in negotiation.&rsquo; The Government further made a definite offer to carry out one-half of the total reduction now, and one-half on the 1st December.  Neither the general proposal   of the Government nor the definite offer of instalments was accepted by the Union representatives.&rdquo; There is the position at the moment.  I may say that because of the fact of the Conference sitting simultaneously with this Parliament, I have not had an opportunity of consulting my colleagues, in relation to this offer; but I think I can state in advance, on their behalf, that they are prepared to consider, and I expect sanction, the advances I have offered to the Union representatives.  This particular offer was made on the distinct understanding, of course, that a strike would not materialise; but I may suggest to the Government, and through the Government to the Dail, that is an unfortunate event I do not wish at this stage to foreshadow. 
     
    
      
       The Dail is now in possession of the material facts. 
     
    
      
       I think it is desirable to say&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       There is one important point.  I was listening to Deputy Walsh and he merely stated the situation, as he was asked.  He did not discuss the matter, and I think this is not the time to discuss the situation. 
     
    
      
       I submit as a matter of order when we are discussing the question of approving or disapproving the re-appointment of Mr. Walsh as Postmaster-General, we are fully entitled to discuss the merits or demerits of that Deputy for that Office that he holds. 
     
    
      
       Oh, yes! 
     
    
      
       The position that faces us is a very serious one.  I take it the Dail and the country will indicate one way or another who is responsible for the situation that may develop.  We know that in March (I think it was) a certain state of affairs arose over the proposed reduction of a Bonus, and there was then a threat of a strike.  Certain incidents took place which led to a considerable amount of ill-will, friction, and antagonism between the parties responsible and the men concerned.  I do not think I am stressing it when I say that despite all Mr. Walsh's experience in that particular service, this experience has not been sufficiently influential to overcome the disadvantages of Mr.   Walsh's temperament, and even since that time one can gather there has been a continuous friction between the Staff and the Postmaster-General, and, one would almost think, a feeling of resentment, that the time was not availed of to allow the country to be deprived of its Postal Services in March last, and that there was ill-feeling, because of that, lying at the back of the Postmaster-General's brain.  The opportunity arose apparently upon the publication of the report of a Commission of Inquiry into certain price increases.  The publication of a certain figure was made&mdash;the figure arrived at by a Committee constituted by two or three separate Governmental Departments. The publication of that figure was accompanied by a series of tables&mdash; a mass of facts or statistics privately circulated, and only published publicly within the last couple of days. 
     
     On the issue of that figure by members of these staffs, the Postmaster-General published a statement to the effect that the issue of this figure would warrant him in cutting off the advance which had been granted by virtue of the Commission's Interim Report, and in addition to that a proportion of the bonus, according to the old arrangement with Civil Servants. The very method of presenting the ultimatum to a body of men was sufficient to rouse their antagonism.  Let it be borne in mind that the Postal Servants had desired that the work of this Commission should be finished by the 1st of September.  It is not their fault that the Commission's work was not finished by that date.  It was by the wish of the P.M.G. that the work of the Commission was deferred.  When a figure arrived at by Departmental officials was issued, the P.M.G. takes the opportunity of lunging in and saying, &ldquo;Here is what you have to take by the 1st September, or clear out,&rdquo; because that is what is meant. In this, as in so many things, there seems to me a lack of appreciation of the mentality of men and women.  For two or three generations, at least for 120 years; every popular newspaper in this country, every popular politician, every agitator, fed the people with the notion that Government statisticians are against the people and are producing figures to down the people, to get advantage of the people.  We have been told from the beginning of things almost that a Government Department is anti-popular and that the officials of   that Department are working against the interests of the people.  Now that is a tradition, and in face of these facts we have this procedure adopted by the Government.  They admit that it is desirable to take out a figure which will represent the increase in the cost of living as between July 1914, and to-day. How do they do it?  They select three or four departmental officials, and when it is represented to them that it would be desirable, in the interests of confidence in the result of the inquiry, that the people who are likely to be affected should have a voice in saying how the enquiry should be conducted&mdash;what was the method adopted so that there should be some confidence in the method of enquiry?  We were told cavalierly &ldquo;You will be told how it is to be done when the result is reached&rdquo;&mdash;exactly a replica of all the things that have been done in the past and that have been so strenuously objected to.  Now the result of the enquiry is published, and I challenge any member of this Dail to go home to his wife or his sister, or his housekeeper, and present those figures and ask her from her practical experience whether they are true or not.  I am not now criticising the method of the enquiry, or even the result of the enquiry, but I am drawing attention to the method of the presentation of this figure and the evidence that was adduced in support of the figure, and the effect on the popular mind of the reading of that explanation. If you test it in the way I have suggested, you will then begin to understand how the production of such a figure has affected the Postal Servants and how it will affect the rest of the public who will be concerned. Immediately on presentation of the result of the enquiry there was an assertion that on and after a certain date there would be a decrease in wages which would wipe out all the advances that were obtained as a result of the Postal Commission plus certain other payments in respect of bonus.  I submit that, on that alone, without any question of the method, the wisdom or the justice of the case, the conduct of the P.M.G. in this matter has proved him unworthy of the position. There is something in handling a man, and if a man is not fitted for handling men, it is not desirable that he should be put into a position of creating a disruption in a public Service.  The claim of the Postal servants is a valid one.   They contend what is to be considered in this matter is not whether the Postal Service is paying, not what people in England are willing to live upon&mdash;or starve upon&mdash;or grow luxurious upon&mdash; but what is a reasonable standard of life in Ireland for a man in the Postal Service, and what it costs to produce that standard. There is no attempt to find out by departmental enquiry what such a cost is, and there is a good deal of misconception about this particular report that was issued, but that is the fault of the people who issued it and the method of presentation. The whole question will probably arise in another form, but I am now indicting&mdash;if I may use such a word&mdash; the P.M.G. for his conduct of these negotiations, and I say, on this particular motion, that they unfit him for the position that is now proposed to be allotted to him. 
    
      
       Deputy Johnson made a number of general charges against the P.M.G., but you will notice that he did not make one single specific charge&mdash; not one.  He complained about his temperament, about his way of handling men, and a number of generalities of that sort, but he did not give a specific instance. 
     
    
      
       May I point out that we were not dealing with postal questions. We were dealing with the fitness of the P.M.G. 
     
    
      
       And as against that may I point out that while he indulged in a number of generalities, he never gave a single specific instance of either discourtesy or incompetence against the P.M.G.  It is no harm that the Dail should know just a few facts about this particular dispute.  I will not go into it at any great length.  I would like just vo say a few things which would perhaps make the issues a little clearer than they are at present.  This cost of living figure was attacked.  It was stated it was found by a Departmental Committee. So it was, but the cost of living figure in England&mdash;the cost of living figure that operated here for years&mdash;was found by a Departmental Committee, and there was not a single attack on it, from that point of view, not a protest.  It is only when an Irish Departmental Committee finds the figure that attacks are made.  That   is rather peculiar.  If I may say it without any disrespect, it is a little like the slave-mind. An Irish Department is as well able to find the figure as an English Department, and if an English Department was entitled to find the cost of living figure an Irish Department is entitled to find it in exactly the same way.  Now criticisms of this figure which come on the merits of the case are welcomed, welcomed by the Department that found it.  They will consider any criticisms; they will receive any evidence which shows that the figures are wrong.  We have not got any.  Again, Mr. Johnson was not specific on that point.  He said generally that the method was all right, but he suggested generally, at the same time, that there was something wrong in the whole thing.  Any specific mistake, any evidence that anyone likes to bring forward is welcome and will get due weight by the Ministry of Economics that found the figure.  That figure was found, and it was found at 90; the English figure is 85. 
     
    
      
       I do not think the Dail should go into a discussion of this figure.  What is under discussion is the nomination of Deputy J. J. Walsh for the position of P.M.G.  As I understood Deputy Johnson's remarks, they were directed towards the temperamental unfitness of Mr. J. J. Walsh for his position Whether the House can discuss or cannot discuss Mr. J. J. Walsh's temperament I am not quite clear, but I do not want the House now to begin a discussion on this question, because if a Minister or any Deputy begins it now we may have appeals to continue it, and we cannot discuss the cost of living figure in any reasonable time this afternoon with regard to our general position.  I think, therefore, there should be a discussion on the fitness or unfitness of Mr. J. J. Walsh for the specific position. When people begin to talk about 85 or 90 we are lost.  I therefore suggest that the discussion should not go on, on the lines that the Minister is now following. 
     
    
      
       That is my own view. The reason I mentioned these matters was because they were raised by Mr. Johnson. 
     
    
      
       What was raised by Mr. Johnson was that Mr. Walsh did not do the thing in the right way. 
     
     
    
      
       There was a little more. I think he got in a great deal. 
     
    
      
       I quite agree, but this is not the proper time to discuss the details of this dispute.  I would only say this: In this dispute the Government applied the figure found by the Irish Department.  In order to give the Postal Officials every chance to meet the cost entailed they agreed to spread it over a certain period, which is a concession the English Government did not make.  It is a concession that is not made in the North of Ireland, and I think it puts the P.M.G. absolutely right in this dispute. 
     
    
      
       I would like to say a word or two in this matter, as I happen to have a special knowledge with regard to the position in the Post Office.  As a result of the dispute which arose last March a Commission was appointed and that Commission issued an interim report about the 15th May, and they recommended that certain temporary increases to the Postal Staff should operate until the Irish cost of living was agreed upon, or until an official report of the Commission was issued.  Now there is special significance attached to this phrase &ldquo;agreed upon.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       Mr. O'Connell, we are not going to discuss what the Postal Commission mean by 85 and 90&mdash;by particular phrases.  This matter will be fully ventilated later, but it is obviously most contentious.  I think Deputy O'Connell will agree with me that this discussion cannot go on. 
     
    
      
       I think you might put the question. 
     
    
      
       The question before the Dail is whether the nomination of Mr. J.J. Walsh as Postmaster-General is approved? 
     
    
      
       I have to say that people have been suspended from their work for alleged conspiracy with people other than those who supported the Government&mdash;those who supported the irregular troops.  I know of a case in Carlow of a Mr. Kane.  I want to know if those men have been proved guilty of any charge, and what is the reason of their suspension? Was it because they might have differed from the P.M.G., or taken a rather active part in the negotiations prior to   the strike or attempted strike last March, or had it any bearing with the action taken by those postal workers in support of the Labour Candidates at the recent election? 
     
    
      
       The Deputy is strictly not entitled to ask that question. 
     
    
      
       If the Deputy gives notice, I certainly will answer the question. 
     
    
      
       The Deputy is out of order.  He must give notice.  I take it for specific reasons you disapprove of Mr. J. J. Walsh as P.M.G. The question will now be put as to the approval of the nomination of Mr. J. J. Walsh as Postmaster-General. 
       The nomination was approved. 
     
   
   
     MINISTERS WITHOUT PORTFOLIOS. 
    
      
       I have now to put before you two Ministers who will not have portfolios&mdash;Mr. Duggan and Mr. Finian Lynch.  It may be necessary to associate Deputy Lynch to some extent with the Ministry of Education.  Under what we will call for the moment the old law&mdash;Dail Eireann and the Provisional Government&mdash;there were two separate Ministers for Education.  We are now doing away with all this.  Mr. Lynch just now is not available for immdiate service in the Government.  He is on active service.  He was a member of the Provisional Government, and Mr. Duggan, who was the last signatory to the Treaty, was the same.  There was a considerable amount of work that required to be done outside the Ministers with portfolios.  I ask the Dail for approval of these two nominations. 
     
    
      
       I want to protest against this.  To start at this early stage of a young National assembly by making appointments which have been generally questioned by old assemblies&mdash;the appointment of Ministers without portfolios who will not be responsible to the Dail I think is a bad procedure and one which we should not support.  I am not saying anything against Deputies Duggan and Lynch, who have held office before and have acquitted themselves honourably.  If they had been proposed for definite offices, I would be   the last to oppose this proposition.  I think we should appoint Ministers to perform definite tasks for which they will be responsible to this Assembly. 
     
    
      
       I associate myself with Deputy Darrell Figgis on this point.  I am strongly in favour of his views.  This is a strange, departure and it ought to be justified.  It looks as if we were to make the appointment first and discover the reasons afterwards.  It would be better if we were told of the special efficiency of these gentlemen, whereby one of them must be a General in the Field and at the same time a quasi-Minister for Education.  The Department of Education is quite safe in the hands of Professor MacNeill.  If help were needed it ought to be secured in a more regular way.  Is there a paucity of Deputies possessed of the experience and abilities deemed essential for such office?  I would expect Deputy O'Connell, who is associated with education, also to protest against a General who is commanding in the Field holding this office.  Efficiency, not persons, is our first concern.  In this Dail we should be honest with each other, and I am determined to speak out upon matters upon which I think it my duty not to remain silent. 
     
    
      
       Are there any others who wish to speak upon this question? 
     
    
      
       Anyone who is familiar with the history of the last four or five months ought to be able to put his finger on the exact point we are discussing now.  Six or eight months ago the Provisional Government was formed of persons entitled to sit in the Southern Parliament.  Two of the gentlemen I have put before the Assembly constituted that Government.  There is no provision in the terms on which that appointment took place for either a dismissal or a resignation, and during the period which has elapsed since Ministers of the Provisional Government have had to make many journeys to England.  Is it reasonably possible to expect Ministers to carry out their duties in Dublin and at the same time be in negotiations in England?  One of these is the last signatory to the Treaty, and he has been on practically every delegation which has crossed to England.  If we did not consider, having regard to our experience in the last six months, that   these appointments are necessary we would not put them forward.  We put Mr. Lynch forward in the confident belief that his appointment is absolutely essential. I believe that those who criticised the appointments did so in good faith, but at the same time I am satisfied that no case has been made to impress the Dail with the necessity for rejecting them. 
     
    
      
       Was the reason given that it was impossible not to include these gentlemen?  I understand the reason given is that they were part of the Provisional Government, set up by the British Government by the transfer to it of Executive powers, and as there is no provision for removal, withdrawal, or resignation we must accept them.  If that is the answer I am prepared to submit to the inevitable, but if not, I consider the arrangement altogether unjustified. 
     
    
      
       I have not stated at any time that the Provisional Government was set up by the British Government. It was set up here in Ireland and it represents the people of Ireland. 
     
    
      
       I was going to point that out.  The Provisional Government was never set up by the British. 
       The nominations were approved. 
     
   
   
     STANDING ORDERS COMMITTEE. 
    
      
       The next business is the appointment of a Committee on Standing Orders. 
     
    
      
       I have been asked to move the appointment of a Committee to prepare and design Standing Orders for the Dail.  As everybody knows, Standing Orders are a very vital part of the machinery of every important Assembly and they will be no less important here.  It is desirable that they give as much latitude as possible to Members in discussion and at the same time lend themselves to efficiency in the discharge of public business here.  It has not been possible in the hasty manner in which it has been done to approach those who might have been conversant with those who would be the best men to put on this Committee.  We have taken them at random, and if there is any question as to who, in the cause of his party, ought to be on the Committee,   the question could be raised by an individual member of his party.  We have to take them as they come.  The question in dispute can be raised by the Hon. Members themselves.  I propose&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       Would it not be better for each Party in the Dail to propose its own representatives? 
     
    
      
       I propose Mr. W. L. Cole, Mr. Pierce Beasley, Mr. Peter Hughes, Mr. Davin, Mr. M. J. Hennessy, Mr. J. Rooney, Mr. J. B. Whelehan, and Prof. E.A. Alton. 
     
    
      
       As one of the members proposed without authority, I would like to ask you who told you to propose my name. 
     
    
      
       I beg to second the motion. 
     
    
      
       That is a matter on which we must have the absolute agreement of the Dail.  As soon as we have this, we can go into the question of who will be selected. 
     
    
      
       On a matter of procedure, would you not permit Mr. O'Brien's motion that we appoint a Committee for this purpose and that the Committee shall be of such and such a number? 
     
    
      
       Might we not use our time in finding out who asked Mr. McGoldrick to propose Mr. Davin. The Deputy said he did not ask him. Now who asked him? 
     
    
      
       That question is already registered. 
     
    
      
       We must take advantage of those indiscretions. 
     
    
      
       The motion before the Dail, as I received it in writing, is that the following eight Deputies be constituted a Committee of the Dail to design and form Standing Orders: Deputies Cole, Beasley, Hughes, Davin, Hennessy, Rooney, Whelehan, and E. A. Alton. 
     
    
      
       I propose:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dail proceed to appoint a Committee to act as a Standing Orders Committee, after the Speaker and representatives of the various parties of this Dail have had an opportunity of consulting, following to-day's adjournment.&rdquo; 
     
     
    
      
       I second the amendment. 
     
    
      
       The amendment proposed is that the Dail appoint a Committee of nine members to act as a Standing Orders Committee, and that the Speaker and the various members of this Dail have an opportunity of consulting, following to-day's adjournment. 
     
    
      
       You will have to recognise every party that is here.  I suggest to Ald. O'Brien that the Committee be formed in proportion to the strength of the party.  Labour should have two and we should have one representative. I think each party should have the privilege of nominating its own representatives.  We have here what is called the Treaty, the Labour, the Independents, and the Farmers' parties. 
     
    
      
       We cannot have this kind of cross-talk.  We will have to do the business in some order. There has been an amendment proposed to the resolution.  I have accepted the amendment.  The idea presumably is that I will consult with any people in the Dail who represent themselves as a party and having done so presumably the Dail will proceed to elect nine Members. 
     
    
      
       My objection is that I do not wish to have my name mentioned unless the party sends in the names. I think the amendment now is that the party should be consulted before any name is mentioned. 
     
    
      
       Is the amendment accepted? 
     
    
      
       The amendment is accepted by the President on behalf of the Government. 
     
    
      
       I have not withdrawn the original resolution.  I proposed and it has been seconded that the Committee be selcted.  I think that resolution will be as fair to all parties as any arrangement they can make.  The sooner you get Standing Orders the better.  You cannot go on as you are going. 
     
    
      
       We will have the privilege of democracy any way.  Everyone will decide for themselves. 
     
    
      
       May I hope that Alderman O'Brien will make a slight   alteration and instead of confining the Committee to nine it might be considered wise after consultation to make it eight or ten as the case may be.  The proposal could come through the Speaker of the Assembly when we meet. 
     
    
      
       I agree to that. 
     
    
      
       The amendment is:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dail proceed to appoint a Committee for Standing Orders and that the Speaker and the representatives of the various parties in the Dail have an opportunity of consulting, following to-day's adjournment.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       Is that explicit, are we going to have a division? 
     
    
      
       We must have it, if someone objects. 
     
    
      
       I join in asking the Dail to accept the amendment. It is one of the most serious amendments that has come before the Dail to-day. The preparation of Standing Orders, and the Standing Orders Committee is one of the most important in any assembly. It prepares the business for the coming week, and if it is a small party, say the farmers, and they want to get something very important discussed during the coming week; if they want Friday they can do so by making representations to the Standing Orders Committee and have the matter discussed forthwith.  I think all the parties ought to have representation, and I ask the Dail to support the amendment, and not let a motion go simply because it is carefully prepared and handed to a deputy who is asked to propose it, which shows that there was a meeting somewhere before this assembly to-day. 
     
    
      
       I would ask the Chairman what is his definition of a party in this Dail? 
     
    
      
       At least one. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
     
    
      
       Before separating I think it would be desirable to let us know the course of business. We meet on Monday, I understand. Will the policy of the Government be before us then? 
     
     
    
      
       If the Dail wishes to have discussed the policy of the Government during the last few months we will facilitate it.  Otherwise the matters taken on Monday will be vacancies, writs for elections, resolutions dealing with the franchise and the Constitution. 
     
    
      
       Would the President formally announce the abolition of Dual Government? 
     
    
      
       Both have been coalesced for three or four months. Both the Dail and Provisional Government met in common under a single Chairman, each Member having the same right, liberty, authority and responsibility. That has been going on, and the staffs have been gradually absorbed in each Ministry.  There were some Ministries that were not provided for under the Provisional Government and these will not be continued unless under the Government set up to-day. Dual Government, you can take it, ends from to-day.  From the date of the appointment of the Ministry here all activities in the country will be carried out under the authority set up which is responsible to you here. 
     
    
      
       There is no motion before the Dail. 
     
    
      
       I propose the adjournment until Monday at three o'clock, and am prepared to get on with the business outlined or discuss what has been going on for two or three months, whichever you desire. 
     
    
      
       I beg to second the motion. 
     
    
      
       Sir Jas. Craig seconds the motion for the adjournment until Monday at three o'clock. 
     
    
      
       A very happy conjunction of names. 
     
    
      
       We would like to know something of the procedure that should be adopted in initiating a discussion such as is suggested.  Will there be a suspension of non-existing Standing Orders, or will it come up on a motion for the adjournment?  What is the procedure if the Ministry is to make a statement?  What is the proper course of procedure? 
     
     
    
      
       If it be desired, I will make a statement on a resolution. 
     
    
      
       My view is that the Standing Orders of the Dail ought to be adopted.  I intended to make that proposal.  Would that meet the position? 
     
    
      
       I would like to hear some arguments in favour of the 3 o'clock meeting as against the 11 o'clock meeting.  There may be good and sufficient reasons why there should not be a meeting until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, but inasmuch as this meeting was called for 11 o'clock, I was under the impression that it was the intention to hold meetings in the morning rather than in the afternoon and at night, because it is almost inevitable, if you do not meet until 3 o'clock, you will sit right on until late in the evening, and that is not conducive to orderly debate in some assemblies. 
     
    
      
       This will be a remarkable exception to that rule. 
     
    
      
       I do not want to move an amendment as to the rule, unless it is necessary for the purpose of eliciting some views. 
     
    
      
       I do not know what is in the mind of the President&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       I leave it absolutely to the Dail. 
     
    
      
       From the point of view of my own staff, an early morning sitting would not be very suitable. 
     
    
      
       It must be plain to Mr. Johnson that tbe normal hour for Meeting could not be 11 o'clock. If the Dail so desired, it would be possible to meet on any particular day at 11 o'clock, but if the business is to be transacted properly it is necessary for Ministers to be in attendance to answer any questions that may be put to them, and they really cannot do anything unless they are able to give some time to their Departmental work.  The only way   we can carry on is to devote the forenoon to Departmental work and then come here in the afternoon.  I think the necessities of the case demand that the hour for meeting should be some time in the afternoon, say 2.30, 3 or 4 o'clock. 
     
    
      
       Let 3 o'clock be 3 o'clock.  3 o'clock does not mean 4 o'clock. 
     
    
      
       There is a motion before the Dail that the Dail shall stand adjourned until Monday at 3 o'clock. 
     
    
      
       And the business before us on that occasion might suitably be a statement by the President on his policy. 
     
    
      
       Are you speaking on the adjournment? 
     
    
      
       Yes.  A statement as to the future policy of the Executive we have just created&mdash;the policy for which we will be responsible. Let that be the subject of debate on Monday, and not more than Monday. Finish it on Monday. 
     
    
      
       Before the motion for the adjournment is iaken, let me mention that a message has Keen received from Lord Fitzalan conveying to this Parliament his very best wishes. 
     
    
      
       The Members on this side do desire a discussion.  It is to be understood that will be on the Orders of the Day? 
     
    
      
       Yes,if I know exactly what it is.  I understand the discussion wished for by the Party for which Alderman O'Brien speaks is to have reference to what has happened in the last two or three months. 
     
    
      
       That could arise very suitably on the President's statement of policy, because presumably that policy will be a continuity of past policies. 
       Motion: &ldquo;That the Dail do now adjourn,&rdquo; put and agreed to. 
       The Dail adjourned at 3.30 p.m. till Monday, September 11th.
