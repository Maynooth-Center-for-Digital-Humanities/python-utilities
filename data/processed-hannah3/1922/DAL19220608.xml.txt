       The Late Mr. Joseph McGuinness, T.D. 
     
    
      
        A Chinn Comhairle, before you move on to the ordinary business of the House, I desire, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, and I am sure it is the wish of every member of this House, to move an expression of sympathy with the family and relatives of the late Mr. Joe McGuinness, a member of this House, the Deputy for Longford. It is not necessary for me to pay any tribute to our deceased colleague. We know the circumstances in which he first came into the position of being a public representative and we know how much those particular circumstances had to do with subsequent political events. We all know the work that Mr. Joe McGuinness did during those years and particularly, if I may say so, the work he did during these last few months. Because who ever spoke harshly of our former colleagues, or who ever thought bitter thoughts of them, or whether pleased or displeased at their actions, no one ever heard Joe McGuinness express an unkind thought about anybody, and nobody ever heard him attribute meaner motives to anybody else than the motives which actuated himself or which inspired himself. If I may say so, his death is something that I deeply feel. He was something more than a colleague and his loss is something more to me than the loss of a colleague, for I believe, among all the friends I ever made, I had no truer friend and there was certainly no one for whom I had a greater affection than I had for Joe McGuinness. 
     
    
      
        Ba mhaith liom aontu leis sin. I would like to be associated with this vote of sympathy on the part of this side of the Dail. Some of us here, including yourself, A Chinn Comhairle, remember our late colleague through his prison experiences and we remember how overjoyed we were when we found that he had been chosen a public representativethe first representative of the men in jail, as he was called at the time. It is not necessary to add anything to what has been said by the Minister for Finance, and I think you will find that the unanimous expression here in favour of that motion will be reciprocated throughout the country. Everyone who knew Joe McGuinness knew that he was a patriotic son of Ireland and knew that he was willing himself to endure everything necessary in order to ensure the independence of Ireland.

       AONACH TAILTEANN. 
       August 3rd&mdash;13th (inclusive). 
       Emerald Chambers, 
       Abbey Street, 
       8/6/'22. 
       &ldquo;A Chara, 
       &ldquo;The last report on Aonach Tailteann was submitted to An Dail about the end of March.  At that time we were still discussing the possible programme and little or no headway had been made in the way of tapping the athletic resources of our people in foreign countries, and it was generally believed even in the ranks of those directly concerned that the time at our disposal was altogether inadequate to do justice to the rebirth of this ancient festival. 
     
     &ldquo;In the meantime, however, very good progress has been made   and the Main Council composed of direct representatives from the Departments of Sport, etc., plus a few specially selected men responsible for sections incidental to the programme is satisfied that the situation is now well in hands. 
     &ldquo;The problem of accommodating visitors is still giving much concern to the Council notwithstanding that some twenty sub-committees are endeavouring to hammer out a scheme designed to obviate the unfortunate experiences of those who visited Antwerp, Athens, and other cities on the occasion of the great Olympics. 
     &ldquo;The Council is therefore composed of the Chairman of each of the following main Committees:&mdash; 
     &ldquo;(1) Instrumental Music; (2) Camogie; (3) Rounders (Women); (4) Athletics and Cycling; (5) Hurling; (6) Football; (7) Handball; (8) Rounders (Men); *(9) Billiards; *(10) Arts; *(11) Motor Cycling; *(12) Rowing; (13) Boxing; (14) Tennis; (15) Golf; *(16) Chess; *(17) Yachting; *(18) Shooting&mdash; Clay Bird; *(19) Shooting&mdash;Rifle Miniature and Revolver; (20) Dancing; (21) Swimming; (22) Catering; (23) Transport; (24) Industrial; (25) Trophies; (26) Decoration; (27) Ambulance; (28) Legal; (29) Publicity; (30) Accommodation&mdash; Visitors; (31) Accommodation&mdash; Athletes; (32) Finance; (33) Social; (34) Ceremonial; (35) Massed Choirs. 
     &ldquo;At the outset it was intended to include only those events which would draw International Competitors but after careful consideration this was found to be impracticable and as it now stands the Programme consists of (1) International; (2) National; (3) Partly national and partly international. 
     &ldquo;Those under No. 2 are starred in the foregoing list.  Physical drill was eliminated because of the lack of competitors, and motor car racing under the absence of a suitable course.  The outstanding features of the different departments are summarised hereunder: 
     &ldquo;(1)  Instrumental Music included seven Band Sections and Union Pipes and Harp.  (2) Camogie has been organised on a scale hitherto unknown.  (3) and (8) Rounders are now being taken up as a real live game.  (4) Athletics and Cycling involve about thirty-six events and are on all fours with Olympic Programme. This section alone will occupy two-and-a-half hours per day for six days.  (5) Hurling v. Shinty.&mdash;In order to bring about a union of the Scottish and Irish Gaels a Hurling-Shinty match will signalise the opening of the games.&rdquo; 
     Mr. Walsh at this stage in the report, said: 
     There is a marked resemblance between shinty and hurling.  Shinty is the great national organisation in Scotland.  We are endeavouring to co-ordinate shinty and hurling and I believe we will succeed in doing so.  It will help to consolidate the two races very much. 
     &ldquo;(7)  Handball is now taken up vigorously throughout the country as a consequence of Aonach Tailteann. (10) Arts&mdash;the Arts department is providing for 47 different sections and will easily eclipse anything hitherto attempted.  (11) Motor-Cycling includes three fifty-mile races.  The absence of a charge for admission to the Phoenix Park deprives the Games Committee of over two thousand pounds revenue.  (12) Rowing&mdash;This is a two full-day Programme of seven Championships with an average of thirty boats to each event.  Such competitions were never known, hitherto, in the Rowing records of this country.  (17) Yachting.&mdash;A two full-day programme is also arranged here&mdash;practically every yacht in Ireland entering. (21) Swimming&mdash;This four-day programme is fixed for the Zoo, control of which we have taken over for the necessary period.  (22) Catering has been taken in hands by the Dublin City and County Caterers Association and in addition to the maximum utilisation of every available resource huge marquees are being erected in public places.  In order to meet the requirements it is found necessary to buy 60,000 sets of ware at a cost of £1,500.  (23) Transport facilities are very complete and special steamers are being run from Britain and America. (24) Industrial displays and pageants will cover this section.  (25) Trophies&mdash;Over eleven-hundred medals will be needed for winners.  Medal   and statuette-casting industries will be started in Dublin as a consequence of this impetus.  (31) Accomodation of Athletes.&mdash;With the assistance of the military we hope to accommodate at least 1,000 competitors and for this purpose it is necessary to purchase 1,000 beds at about £3 per bed.  Not one of the Residential Colleges could be got to accommodate competitors&mdash;home or foreign&mdash;though it would cost them nothing.  This fact should be borne in mind when the nation's money is being spent on these anti-Irish institutions.&rdquo; 
     We made every effort to get the foreign competitors properly housed and fed.  No country can take the risk of bringing men from 'Frisco and other far off places without at least seeing to their welfare in the interval.  And we were hoping to get accommodation in some of the big colleges here but, unfortunately, we have not succeeded.  We found it necessary to take over one of the big barracks and furnish it.  There was no other alternative. 
     &ldquo;Foreign Representation&mdash;At least six countries will be represented in Aonach Tailteann.  The number may probably reach nine or ten.  Had the necessary time&mdash;say two or three years&mdash;been at our disposal there is no doubt whatever but Australasia instead of not being represented would have had a full compliment of competitors.  Industrial depression has deprived us of many more men from Canada, Newfoundland, and Wales. 
     &ldquo;It is only proper to state that our capital city lacks a stadium such as capitals generally enjoy, but as a temporary measure to meet the present situation the Provisional Government were good enough to make a grant of £10,000 towards the improvement of Croke Park&mdash; otherwise the Aonach would in all probability have been abandoned. 
     &ldquo;The immediate result of An Dail's assistance to the games and pastime of the nation will be the production here in August of the biggest athletic carnival held in any country in modern times.&rdquo; 
     Mr Walsh added: 
     As a matter of fact the Aonach Tailteann is more than twice as large as the Greek Olympic which it includes and provides in addition for a great many matters which were not included in the Greek Olympic or in the ancient Tailteann games of this country. 
     The report went on to state:&mdash; 
     &ldquo;The training and equipment of an athletic team to compete against the principal European countries in their respective capitals next summer; a highly developed combination to perform in Paris at the Greek Olympics in 1924 and representation at the Aonach Tailteann possibly in New York in 1925. 
     &ldquo;Whether Aonach Tailteann will remain confined to the Irish race henceforth or blossom out as an international feature like the Greek Olympic is a matter which representatives of the various countries will decide when they meet to discuss such matters in August next.&rdquo; 
     We have got representations from America to the effect that it would be advisable to depart from the idea of confining the Tailteann games to the Irish race and seeing that they predated the Greek Olympic by a thousand years we should be justified in entering upon a more varied programme.  We believe that up to yesterday the Greek Olympic Committee would have excluded Germany, Russia, Scandinavia, and other countries and from their inclusion by us in a few years' time we would have been able to go forth in the international sphere as a going concern.  We now find that they have included all these countries.  And we will have to reconsider, therefore whether our programme henceforth will be international in the full sense or whether it will be confined to the Irish race.  At the outset we didn't know how much would be required to finance the Tailteann Games.  It is pretty much a leap in the dark to suggest a certain sum.  I said I hoped we could get the programme through on £5,000; So far the Dail has voted £4,000 and to-day I am asking for a further grant of £1,000 four-fifths of which is required for the equipment of our catering department and the furnishing of the barracks to which I have referred.  The receipts from this programme which covers something like ten days will be very big.  I should not be surprised if the nett financial results will be at any rate £7,000 or £8,000.  By the action of the Dail and the Dail Cabinet   much has been done for Irish games, and I must say the most enthusiastic backer of the Tailteann Games when the matter was introduced at our meeting was Mr. de Valera.  I must say you have done for Irish athletics what we believe would never materialise in our time.  It is a matter of great importance to the nation that it should be well represented in these international competitions.  Our people in the past, while producing the athletic stars of the world, got no compensation because of the fact that they were picked up and utilised and exploited by other nations. Now you are recognised to-day by this Greek Olympic Council and you have your own programme stretching out into the universe, and you have placed Irish athletics on a footing which will ensure their absolute success in the future.  I will ask the Dail not to look upon this programme in any sense as a political one.  You have not done so so far and our Committee is composed of men of both political sides, but the question of politics has not arisen.  And though it is hard on the financial resources of the Dail I will ask you to support us by passing this unanimously. 
    
      
       I beg to second the motion. 
     
    
      
       The motion is that the Dail approves of the report.  Are you all agreeable to that? 
     
    
      
       There is one paragraph to which I take exception, that is with regard to the colleges.  The report says: 
       &ldquo;Not one of the residential colleges could be got to accommodate competitors&mdash;home or foreign&mdash; though it would cost them nothing. This fact should be borne in mind when the nation's money is being spent on these Anti-Irish institutions.&rdquo; 
       Now, I only received the report when I came to the Dail meeting this evening. But I think it is unfair to state that the Dublin residential colleges are anti-Irish institutions because&mdash;for reasons which seem sufficient to them&mdash;they refuse to accommodate competitors&mdash;home or foreign.  Now these colleges are performing educational work for the nation under conditions which those of us who are in touch with educational conditions in the Dail know are very difficult, and I would be very sorry to think when the nation's money was being allocated to these colleges that any college which refused to do what the Tailteann Games Committee asked them to do should be penalised.  I think it is altogether an unfair statement, and the inference that a legislative assembly of this kind should take this matter into consideration when allocating public money to the colleges is not a thing which an assembly of this kind could stand over.  I do not wish to make a fuss over it, but I would like to say it is a statement that I would not care to allow to pass unchallenged. 
     
    
      
       I am rather glad to have an opportunity of drawing attention to it.  I put the position of these colleges more clearly before the country and our people and I wanted the people of Ireland&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       It is hardly in order for the Minister to speak at this stage. 
     
    
      
       I assume there is nobody else to speak on the report. 
     
    
      
       Do not assume that at all.  To put the matter in order I wish to say that I agree altogether with the remarks of the Minister for Education. I think it would be well if that paragraph were deleted from the report. I think it is only fair to the members here that a report of that kind would be circulated in advance, just as it would be well also for the future conduct of the Dail if the programme for the day could be circulated in advance to the whole House. 
       Now about that paragraph in the report, it carries with it its own condemnation. It is not at all necessary to make a speech about it and I hope that Deputy Walsh will withdraw that paragraph. It would be the easiest way out of it. 
     
    
      
       I refuse to withdraw that paragraph and I would make my position very clear on it.  The House may turn down the Report if it likes, but when we state what we believe to be true in respect of these colleges it is our duty to stick to it.  Now for the last ten or eleven years these colleges have been acting in the most anti-Irish fashion&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
    
      
       The Deputy is not in order. 
     
    
      
       One moment, please, I have a right to reply. 
     
    
      
       You must obey my ruling. 
     
    
      
       I do not withdraw the paragraph.  I certainly refuse to delete it. 
     
    
      
       To put the matter in order, I move that that particular paragraph about the colleges be deleted.  I think if the Postmaster General got an elephant to send through the post by parcel post he would say that the Post Office is not supposed to carry elephants.  Now these colleges are for educational purposes and it is not their function to turn themselves into boarding establishments.  You can with very great difficulty mix up those things with one another.  I think, as I was saying to the Minister of Finance, that this particular report was probably written late at night and the Director was in bad humour when he wrote it.  It would be a condemnation of the Dail if it held out a threat to some of the national institutions of this country in future.  The idea ought be if they are not up to the standard of the national inspirations of the Director that he ought to develop some means in order to restore them to the nation and not to threaten them with extinction.  Human nature is capable of very great improvements. You all admit that.  It would be well if things could be improved, and you cannot do that by threats. 
     
    
      
       I second Alderman Cosgrave, because it is a preposterous thing to ask Universities to turn themselves into boarding houses and hotels.  You must be very careful to whom you extend the hospitality of a university or college.  They were not created for this and I think it was a preposterous thing to ask them to do it, and therefore I think that paragraph ought to be deleted. 
     
    
      
       I wish to know whether the Minister for Local Government wishes to delete two paragraphs or only one.  Is it the last sentence he means? 
     
    
      
       I think the two ought to be deleted.  One is a matter of information, I should say.  It is clearly a matter that should be brought into the report.  I have no wish to let men escape condemnation but I do not think it is their business to do what they are asked to do.  You might as well ask me to do something that was entirely outside my business. 
     
    
      
       I have a great deal of sympathy with the director of the Tailteann Games on account of the past attitude of some of these colleges towards Irish games.  I know nothing at all about what he refers to now.  But if the attitude of the colleges towards the games which he is promoting now under the auspices of Dail Eireann is anything like what it has been to my knowledge in the past, I think he is justified in expressing the views he has expressed and in introducing something or other to mark his condemnation of their conduct. 
     
    
      
       I wish to say something like what has been said by Mr. Stack.  It seems to me that what the Minister for Education said is quite true, that you cannot penalise educational institutions, in the form suggested, and there was a mistake in the form in which that proposal was made.  But I also felt that the Postmaster General was serious and I do not wish to say that even the Minister that followed him was not serious in his proposal against this.  But I would appeal to the House to consider whether it is at least not unfortunate that nothing has been done to win the sympathy of people who in the past have acted apart from such movements.  It seems to me that there is a serious feeling behind this declaration that even now nothing can be done.  Nothing has been done in places, perhaps, such as those referred to to create a more reasonable attitude to a public undertaking of this sort. 
     
    
      
       It is not very clear whether this £5,000 is in addition to the £4,000 or whether Deputy Walsh is ask for £1,000 or for £5,000 now. 
     
    
      
       I would like to explain how this matter arose&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       I suggest that we dispose of the amendment. 
     
     
    
      
       I think I should be allowed to speak.  You can see that there are two sides to this question and you switch me off before&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       You are quite free to speak on the amendment. 
     
    
      
       Very well.  This was discussed by the Aonach Tailteann Committee and it was decided, seeing that the games would be on during the summer period, when the pupils were away from the colleges, it would not be unreasonable to ask the authorities of these colleges to place the buildings, without any equipment, at the disposal of the Tailteann Committee.  There were two proposals; first, that we get the equipment and pay for the cleaning up, and second that we get the colleges over with only cooking equipment.  Now these proposals were put forward in writing and supported by a deputation of pretty responsible men, and not in any one instance did we get any encouragement. There is an analogy or precedent for what we proposed.  Any of you who have been to Leipzig knows that every college there thinks it an honour to assist the city and if there is any public spirit in the colleges in this country a sympathetic response should have been made to us. And I say that no institutions in this country have done more to poison and destroy the nation than the colleges, and I stand for it. 
     
    
      
       I do not quite understand the motion of the Minister for Local Government.  He proposed to delete the sentence.  This fact should be borne in mind.  Does he propose to delete only that much? 
     
    
      
       The whole of it from the words &ldquo;not one of the residential colleges could be got&rdquo; down to &ldquo;anti-Irish institutions.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       If Deputy Walsh would substitute some other word it might meet the case.  I know in the G.A.A. in the past the difficulties we had with such colleges.  They were really the home of foreign games and anti-national outlook which we were trying to change.  There is no use waiting upon them.  We did wait upon them time and again and asked them to take up the games, but they would not foster them. It was the common people that fostered the games.  Certainly the educational authorities did nothing, but I would not be for penalising the youth of the future in Ireland.  Certainly this assembly should not do so.  But we should set out something there to show that the old feeling is still there, and that it is dying hard. 
     
    
      
       I think it altogether unfair that a general statement should be made&mdash;&ldquo;Not one of the residential colleges could be got to accomodate competitors, home or foreign, though it would cost them nothing.&rdquo; There are a great many residential colleges in the country that were not asked. 
     
    
      
       This refers to the residential colleges in and around Dublin. 
     
    
      
       Very well.  It should be made very definite which colleges are concerned. 
     
    
      
       I object to the words because the matter at issue here is not whether residential colleges in or around Dublin do not support Irish games.  I know some of them do not.  They deserve condemnation for it.  But the issue here is not that at all.  It is a fact that they would not accommodate certain competitors, and because they would not accommodate them they are called anti-Irish.  I refuse to accept that.  The college, which for reasons of its own, refuses to accommodate competitors is not anti-Irish, because of that.  Now, if the second part of the paragraph&mdash;&ldquo;This fact should be borne in mind when the nation's money is being spent on these anti-Irish institutions,&rdquo; means anything it means that when allocating educational grants to educational establishments we should penalise colleges which have refused to accommodate competitors at the Tailteann Games. 
     
    
      
       Which have refused to take any part whatever in the national games. 
     
    
      
       I am speaking on this and I submit I should not be interrupted here.  I look upon it as a member of the legislative assembly which is allocating educational grants.  We are asked to penalise residential colleges which are performing educational work on grounds which have nothing to do with education.   It is a wrong principle and I do not see how any thinking Deputy in the Dail can agree with this.  The question &ldquo;for&rdquo; or &ldquo;against&rdquo; Irish games is irrelevant. I am opposed to it for the particular reason I give, that these colleges are described as &ldquo;anti-Irish,&rdquo; and that we are asked to penalise them for reasons that are not educational and that are not necessarily Irish. 
     
    
      
       I move that the question be now put. 
     
    
      
       I second it. 
     
    
      
       I suggest that Deputy Walsh should withdraw that paragraph for this reason&mdash;that we have now had an opportunity of airing our views.  These colleges are certainly anti-Irish. They have boycotted our games, and when it comes to allocating money we will have to think of it; but whether in this or the new Dail the G.A.A. will have to discuss it. 
       QUESTION: &ldquo;That the question be now put&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     
    
      
       I am prepared to withdraw the sentence, seeing that we have concentrated the necessary attention on these colleges, which was our object, naturally.  As Mr. McCarthy says we will follow it up later on. 
     
    
      
       Will the Minister for Local Government withdraw his amendment? 
     
    
      
       Certainly. 
     
    
      
       In dtaobh an chuig mile punt seo ba mhaith liom fios a fhail an iasacht no grant e seo?  An dtabharfaidh Coisde Aonach Tailteann an meid sin airgid ar ais don Dail aris ma thagann an t-airgead isteach chucha? 
     
    
      
       I wish to make a suggestion, and I hope it will be accepted by the director.  The paragraph in the last page of the report says &ldquo;the immediate result of An Dail's assistance to the games and pastimes of the nation will be the production here in August of the biggest athletic festival held in any country in modern times.&rdquo;  I suggest that we should alter that to the Dail's &ldquo;promotion of the games and pastimes,&rdquo; because it was the Dail's promotion and he is only acting under the Dail. 
     
    
      
       I accept that.  As to Mr. Fahy's question, seeing that this is a grant and seeing that the entire monies are those of the Dail, there is no doubt that the results will revert naturally to the Dail.  I pointed out that we would make a profit of several thousand pounds from the Tailteann games.  That is the Dail money. 
     
    
      
       Then I put the adoption of the report, with the two amendments that have been made, one omitting the two sentences with reference to the colleges being anti-Irish and the other changing the word &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; to &ldquo;promotion.&rdquo;  I declare the report passed.  Now there is the question of the vote of £5,000. 
     
    
      
       In the absence of the Minister for Finance, I am moving this vote at his request.  There has been already voted a sum of £4,000.  The director explains that he will be able to restore this money.  I think the profit he has stated that they will make shows him to be the most optimistic director we have had. 
     
    
      
       Because he knows his business. 
     
    
      
       I am moving the estimate accordingly. 
     
    
      
       I second that. 
     
    
      
       Are we to take it as a loan? 
     
    
      
       Yes. 
     
    
      
       When I suggested that these games be started Deputy Walsh suggested £2,000.  Now we have gone up to £9,000, and whilst I will support this £5,000 to finish it, I think we have gone as far as our funds will allow us in supporting these games.  I would like to say that it is most unwise to change these games from the Irish Race Games into being competitors with the Greek Olympic.  I think we ought to keep them as definitely Irish games. 
     
     
    
      
       Of course we will bear in mind Mr. de Valera's suggestion, but I would like to explain that the estimate submitted by me at a few hours' notice was £2,000 or £3,000 and at the time we anticipated a very limited programme. As soon as I got an opportunity, within a fortnight I re-submitted a programme and stated definitely that its promotion would cost at least £5,000.  And I have not exceeded the £5,000.  I have only gone to £4,000, but as I explained here, we have introduced a great many additional features.  We certainly will require no more. 
     
    
      
       Is it in order for a Deputy who is not a Minister to second it? 
     
    
      
       Yes, certainly. It must be moved by a Minister but any Deputy can second it.  Now this motion is before you. 
     
    
      
       Is it £5,000 plus the £1,000 already received? 
     
    
      
       £4,000 has been already voted and £1,550 has been expended.  This is a vote over and above what has been expended for the special department in connection with the catering committee.  Now the total vote as far as the Dail is concerned from the beginning amounts to £9,000 of which a sum of £1,500 has been already expended. 
     
    
      
       I would like to ask if the amount of money spent in giving employment in connection with these games will justify that expenditure when there is so much need and so many unemployed throughout the country. A little further down we have a request for £5,000 for Mayo, and there is starvation in the County Donegal.  I know those games will give employment and will bring in some profit.  It is a question of consideration whether the amount of employment given by this grant will justify this expenditure in face of the terrible want in Donegal and the west of Ireland.  I know that there is a great advantage in athletic festivals of this kind, but I doubt if it should be undertaken on such a big scale on this particular year, in view of the distress in the country.  If, on the other hand, that £9,000 will give adequate employment to those who have none, I would have nothing to say to it.  But I would like to put before the Dail whether the money could not be better spent and have the Games undertaken on a smaller scale for this year? 
     
    
      
       As a matter of fact, every penny has been spent in giving employment.  We have already started two new industries and we are starting a third. 
     
    
      
       I suggest that the Deputy wait and then he could reply when the speakers have finished. 
     
    
      
       It is easier to do it the other way. 
     
    
      
       I would like to say a word.  The more practical way of looking at it is this: It seems to me that Mr. Walsh has done very efficient work and seeing what it is and what it is going to be he has done it extremely cheap.  The £4,000 has not been spent, but if we do not give this £5,000 we are simply spoiling the whole thing; every farthing invested in it so far will be lost.  I look at it that as we have gone so far it would be bad finance for the Tailteann Games and bad for the country to stop the thing now.  I consider that £9,000 is a very small sum for a gigantic thing like this to be done.  Also I would like to point out that the money is like an investment and will be helpful.  Money will be spent here.  I would be strongly in favour of giving this further loan. 
     
    
      
       I am in support of the grant, but I would be more so if the director had introduced the game of bowls.  I heard this first in Lincoln prison and it was discussed by Mr. de Valera and Sean O'Mahony. They were anxious about rounders, and some men from Cork and the west wanted bowls.  That is an old Irish game.  I think we should unanimously grant this loan.  It is perhaps too big a start but it is necessary to give it. Every one of us should aim to make the Tailteann Games a success. 
       Vote of £5,000 put and agreed to. 
     
   
   
     FHINE GHAEDHEAL&mdash;REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE. 
    
      
       The next   item is&mdash;Tuairisg an gCoiste Speisialta ar Fhine Ghaedheal (Report of Special Committee on Fhine Ghaedheal).  It is suggested that this report should be postponed for a month or six weeks.  It is possible some contentious matters may arise and the money could not be made available.  I suggest, with the approval of the Minister, that that matter should be left over for some time. 
     
    
      
       I do not think that is fair at all.  This vote for £5,000 is a loan for the organisation of the Fhine Ghaedheal.  A committee was set up by Dail Eireann to report.  They report here before you.  When I proposed it, formally, I was not aware that it was not in order for a private member to propose that.  At that time the matter was postponed, because of the necessity of getting a report on the congress in Paris.  That report was here and I think it justified the position I took up in asking for that vote.  By the Standing Orders I am ruled out.  I cannot propose it.  But I protest against the Ministry withholding money for such a purpose, particularly as it was definitely a loan and there was no question as to whether it would come back.  It was to enable the organisation to get on its feet, and it meant that it was a saving of expenditure.  I am not quite sure of the exact sum.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will tell us how much it cost the Dail to promote the last congress. If you do not give a loan you will allow the money to go waste, and I wish to protest absolutely against this. 
     
    
      
       I see no objection whatever to the motion being taken now.  The question of the money is different.  I think it would meet the case if the report were read now and the proposal I would make is that the question of finances be dealt with by the next Dail which would be in a much better position to deal with it.  The question of finance is slightly different. Therefore, I propose to hand in the report which has been handed to me by the Committee. 
     
    
      
       I suggest, before bringing forward this report, that the Dail would put a Deputy Ceann Comhairle in the Chair.  The members of the Dail are aware that I have been more or less in a controversial way associated with this matter. 
     
    
      
       I do not think it is a bit contentious. 
     
    
      
       There is one correction, at all events, that I want to make. 
     
    
      
       I think it is much better in the long run to postpone it.  Will you take a show of hands on postponing it? 
     
    
      
       I am interested in two sides of it.  I am interested in the report itself, if there is to be a discussion on it, and I am immediately interested in what gave rise to it; that is that the sum of £5,000 be available. 
     
    
      
       It was with a view of settling that that I moved that it be postponed. 
     
    
      
       Ni doigh liom gur cheart an rud sin i dtaobh an airgead a thabhairt isteach in aon chor. I want to know whether there is any rule that any member outside the Cabinet cannot move a matter of this kind. I do not think there is any such rule. 
     
    
      
       Yes, there is &mdash;Rule 14b. 
     
    
      
       Yes. That rule says: &ldquo;Money resolutions may only be moved by a member of the Ministry.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       Was not that rule broken at the meeting where Deputy Walsh asked for the money? 
     
    
      
       On the previous occasion I moved the vote and Mr. de Valera seconded it. 
     
    
      
       I do not think I was in the Chair then.  But one breach of the rule is no reason why there should be other breaches. 
     
    
      
       This association has been a while in existence and it is wanting the money and we should know as well now as in a month's time whether the money should be granted. After what has happened during the last week I think we should agree to it. 
     
    
      
       I agree with that.  I did not agree with what happened in   Paris.  It was an unfortunate thing that Mr. de Valera's Party rather tried to utilise this movement. 
     
    
      
       There is no motion before us at all at present. 
     
    
      
       Well I have a right to urge that this money be voted. 
     
    
      
       There is no motion before us. 
     
    
      
       You should have raised that point earlier, when the previous speaker introduced it, not now. 
     
    
      
       I submit that a motion is not necessary.  You have it here on the agenda and unless we are in agreement with it it should be deferred. You have a report here. 
     
    
      
       Every one of these reports has been formally moved and seconded. 
     
    
      
       After being read. 
     
    
      
       Yes, if it is necessary to read it; that is the universal procedure. 
     
    
      
       Well, I would like to move the adoption of the report.  I suppose I can speak now.  I do not agree with the method pursued in Paris, with a view to capturing the organisation, because at that time feeling did prevail. It helped to destroy the movement for cementing the Irish race.  At the same time there were many things that we would like to repeat.  If I had an opportunity of speaking in Paris I would have made it clear that I resented a political organisation on the other side which happened to take the view of the matter in a narrow sense.  An open big view should have been taken rather than a narrow political view and I still feel and I still believe and those who think like me politically have come to the fixed conclusion that their side is not properly represented, and I see no reason why Mr. de Valera and Mr. Collins should not arrive at some conclusion which would bring about an equality, or a satisfactory government for this movement.  It is very necessary for our race.  Nobody would deny that and nobody wants to be partial or political.  And I think  we  should have common sense enough now when we have pacts and agreements to come to a simple agreement on a matter of this kind.  You are going to get nothing by shelving it or keeping it a political organisation for one Party. You can get a lot of money by a movement of the whole people. 
     
    
      
       I should like to second the adoption of this report, because I want to say a word on it before it becomes contentious.  First we handed to the committee that went into it an enormous mass of evidence.  They gave a great deal of time to it.  The report that they have presented is one with which, so far as it goes and so far as it is unanimous the Government need not quarrel at all.  The difference is very small.  Most members here are completely out of touch with the business. With your permission I will read the report for you. 
       &ldquo;DAIL EIREANN. 
       &ldquo; Report  by Committee appointed as result of motion by Eamon de Valera for a vote of £5,000 as loan to Fhine Ghaedheal. 
       &ldquo; Present. &mdash;Dr. P.M. Cartan, S. Dwyer, C. Collins, R. Barton. 
       &ldquo; Terms of Reference. &mdash;That pending the consideration of the motion by Mr. de Valera for £5,000 for Fhine Gaedheal a committee of two from each side examine the reports under an agreed Chairman, so that a report be presented to the next meeting of this House. 
       &ldquo;The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of Dublin kindly consented to act as agreed Chairman. 
       &ldquo; Report. &mdash;The World Congress of the Irish Race met in Paris on Jan. 20th, and concluded on January 27th, 1922. 
       &ldquo;It set up a permanent organisation known as the Fhine Ghaedhail with the following objects:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;1.  To assist the people of Ireland to attain to the full their National ideals, political, cultural, and economic, and to secure for Ireland her rightful place among the free nations of the earth. 
       &ldquo;To foster among people of the Irish Race throughout the world knowledge of the Irish language, literature, history and general culture. 
     
     
       &ldquo;3.  To promote the Commerce, Trade and Industries of Ireland. 
     &ldquo;The congress was not as fully representative of the Irish Race throughout world as had been intended. 
     &ldquo;Of the sixty American Delegates only six attended and no delegate attended from the Self Determination League of Canada.  Their abstention was due to the new situation in Ireland.  We consider that had the Congress been fully representative of the Irish Race it could have produced a constitution with more laudable objects. 
     &ldquo; Examination of Reports. &mdash;We have examined the reports submitted to us by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and have called for others wherever we deemed the same to be useful to our examination. 
     &ldquo;We find that: 
     &ldquo;1.  There was an expression of partisan views on each side and that such expression was inevitable in the circumstances prevailing. 
     &ldquo;2.  That the entire congress was unanimous in the resolutions passed concerning the foundation, aims, objects, programme, powers, and membership of the Council of the Fhine Ghaedhail. 
     &ldquo;3.  In some of the reports Mr. de Valera is charged with breach of faith in supporting the election of Mr. R. O'Brennan as Secretary of the Fhine Ghaedhail. 
     &ldquo;The committee agree that Mr. de Valera did support the election of Mr. O'Brennan and see no breach of faith in the act. 
     &ldquo;(4)  The credentials committee alone were responsible for the admission of delegates to the congress. This committee was equally representative of both parties. 
     &ldquo;(5)  Dr. M'Cartan, Messrs. Collins and Barton consider that temporary accommodation by way of a loan should be made to the organisation.  Mr. Dwyer dissents. 
     &ldquo;(We are not informed what are the views of the Lord Mayor). 
     &ldquo;(Signed) Laurence O'Neill, Conchubhair O Coileain, Riobard Bartun, Padraic Mac Artain, Seumus O Duibhir.&rdquo; 
    
      
       continuing said: The committee have not reported upon a matter which would have been of much importance, that is the defects charged against the present organisation, the suggestion that it was not worthy of confidence, and I think it would be necessary to refer the matter back to the committee for a further report.  As things have turned out, we are now on the eve of a coalition Ministry and in these circumstances I do not think there should be any difficulty in adjusting this matter.  The reason I ask the Dail to take a serious view of it and not to treat it lightly was expressed by Mr. de Valera when he first opened this matter and showed the importance of it.  I am quoting from the  Independent  of 3rd March, 1922, when he said: 
       &ldquo;When that became a contentious question between representatives from Ireland he repeated that that was Party gone mad.&rdquo; 
       Now I concur in what Mr. de Valera said in saying it is of great importance to us and to the proper development of the influence of the Irish race abroad that this organisation should be developed to the full, and that it ought to get the support of the Government.  But it would be obvious to everyone that if it is to get the Government's support the Government must be satisfied that it is being properly conducted and any charges made that it is carrying out other objects must be sufficiently disproved to satisfy the Government that it is justified in supporting it.  In the particular circumstances with the Coalition Government coming into power the matter could be very simply arranged. The Government could advance this money, and it should also of course know, before the money is voted by some kind of an estimate what the money is for. 
     
     I remember the Deputy for Waterford was very eloquent upon that subject the last time.  Our information is very inadequate indeed.  The next assembly of this congress will not be held until 1925, and I think if at the next meeting, after the elections, if a motion were brought up with an estimate showing how much was wanted in the immediate future, and with the proposal associating the Government in some way with the organisation, there should be no difficulty at all in the association getting such support as it may need.  But in   the circumstances I suggest this to the other side, that it would be better to defer the actual matter of a money vote.  I, for one, am anxious that we should do all we can to remove the stigma under which this association lies amongst certain of our countrymen overseas, at the present moment, because it will do no good unless you satisfy the overseas delegates that the association has the support of both the principal Parties in this country, irrespective of Party.  You are up against this fact that, rightly or wrongly, and as charges and counter-charges have been made publicly, rightly or wrongly, a certain number of delegates repressenting Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand and the Argentine have gone away with an unfavourable impression of this association and have reported unfavourably to their people at home.  If this association is to get a chance those people should be reassured, and until we have composed our differences at home and stood by the association by the joining hands of both Parties so that the association would seem to be supported by the Government they will not be reassured.  I think it will be agreed if you leave that to a Coalition Government you would give the necessary assurances to Irishmen overseas. 
    
      
       Just a few words. I am against altogether the idea that underlies this suggestion.  I am against any Government representation on the governing body of that association.  It is autonomous, it is not run by the Government of this country, and it would be bad if it were.  It was made up of representatives of the race from all parts of the world.  Because of the circumstances it was not as full a meeting as we thought to have.  But I am directly against any representation of the Government on that, because it would lose its principal value, because it would be said that the Government of Ireland was dictating to the citizens of other countries, and I am against that. Now it was said that charges were not made publicly.  They were made publicly. They were made by rumour and in the Press, and every one of these charges was false.  I defy the committee to bring forward any bit of definite evidence to substantiate these charges.  The Committee's report is that there was a definite expression of partisan views on both sides.  I daresay it was impossible for any representatives for Ireland at that time to speak anything except what was in their minds, and if it had a reflex of that sort it was natural. That was the suggestion, that there was a definite effort made by one side here to capture that association.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote me a statement and he says he agrees with it. To prove that it was not partisan, my attitude was that we were to direct the parties, that we were not to get success by the balance of parties, but by ignoring parties.  Those who objected to this were looking at the members of the Committee in a partisan manner, instead of looking on them as they have been elected for reasons quite other than party reasons.  I say that those who have been responsible for spreading these charges ought to have brought forward evidence.  The best evidence of my personal attitude is the full transcript of the proceedings.  Practically every thing I said is in these minutes, and I stayed at the meetings the whole time; I had no time for lobbying.  I do not think that this association ought to get direct Government support.  The Government in giving an opportunity for the Congress to meet and giving an opportunity which I had wished for in getting the loan of the executive work of the organisation to start has done what the Government ought to do, and I think that the Government, Coalition or any other Government, ought to retire from the business the moment that is done.  If it is valuable at all it will be valuable because of its work as an autonomous self-supporting organisation. Just as the proposed Tailteann Games will be able to support themselves, so just this association will be able to support itself.  In asking for it I simply wanted to see that the money spent by the Dail in bringing about this Congress will not be wasted by failure to complete the work that has been done.  I would feel as much justified in voting against or in opposing an extra £5,000 that was asked for here in order to bring to completion the work of the Tailteann Games Committee as I would be in opposing the £5,000 loan to this, and it is the same attitude I would take up towards both.  I do hope that the Ministry will consider this matter, and will not keep the association waiting, that it will give definite &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; and then let the association depend   upon its own efforts.  We prefer to know definitely if this vote is given now than to postpone it for another month. 
     
    
      
       The less we have about these reports the better and I think it is better to stop the debate as quickly as possible because it is not going to make for progress.  I agree with Mr. de Valera that the Government should not be represented upon the governing body of the association, because that makes the Government responsible for every act of that organisation.  The Government should not be responsible; the organisation should be free to act as it likes, independent of the Government. I do not care about one side or the other.  Between the two it is only a sham difference that exists.  When we are up against the common enemy we are united.  The men in that organisation worked as much for the interests of Ireland as any other men.  If there is a crisis to-morrow we will be all together.  The sooner England realises that the better. 
     
    
      
       I support the Deputy about that.  Some of the reports are very long.  We reached an agreement on four clauses and we reached 75 per cent. agreement on the fifth.  The Lord Mayor who consented to act as Chairman and gave us a great deal of assistance, acted in an independent and impartial capacity; and I might remind the Dail at the time we reached the agreement, that agreements were not as popular as to-day, and I would ask the Dail to support the first agreement we reached. 
     
    
      
       As representative of the 25 per cent.&mdash;the dissenting minority&mdash;I want to say that I am absolutely at one with every single line in the report and with Mr. de Valera's stand on the question of Government control.  That is precisely the reason why I dissented on the matter of the grant.  I want to say that exactly Mr. de Valera's attitude is my attitude and I believe the same thing is due to the Tailteann Games.  I took up the same attitude on the Tailteann Games. 
     
    
      
       There is one point on which it is absolutely essential that I should make a brief statement.  I will ask the Dail to put somebody else in the Chair while I am making it. 
     
    
      
       I move that Liam de Roiste takes the Chair. 
       Mr. Liam de Roiste then took the Chair. 
     
    
      
       There is one point that I wish to have definitely cleared up.  I was unable to be present when this matter was discussed last in the Dail.  Consequently, I can only rely on the reports of the proceedings. It was reported that one Deputy said that I, as a member of the Committee, or Council, which was elected in Paris, opposed the appointment as Secretary, of Mr. Robert O'Brennan.  Well now, I wish to say as plainly as words can say it that that is not so.  I did not oppose the election of Mr. Robert O'Brennan.  I proposed that under the circumstances another co-Secretary should be joined with Mr. O'Brennan; that was my proposal, not that Mr. O'Brennan should not be appointed Secretary.  And that proposal was rejected.  Now, I am not going to go into reasons &ldquo;for&rdquo; or &ldquo;against&rdquo;.  I am not going to add anything at all to the controversial aspect.  What I say now will not be contradicted by any person who knows the facts.  With regard to the procedure in Paris, Mr. de Valera has stated his views about them.  He thinks one way about those proceedings. I think another way.  Beyond that I do not wish to go.  I do not wish to say anything to influence the members of the Dail in one way or another with regard to the merits of the proposal.  I simply wish to put the members of the Dail in possession of the facts, because the third finding of the Committee seemed in some way or another to be based on a mistaken view of what took place. 
     
    
      
       O ta tu criochnuithe anois tog an chathoir aris. 
     
    
      
       Better finish it up now. 
     
    
      
       As we are discussing this Report, there is one matter I would wish to draw attention to.  It says: 
       &ldquo;Of the sixty American delegates, only six attended, and no delegate attended from the Self Determination League of Canada.&rdquo; 
     
     I was there and I saw a lady who was   paid by this Dail get up and speak as the representative of Canada, and I saw her also vote and I noticed also a number of other people who voted and who had no claim to be representative.  I say that this matter relating to the Credentials Committee is an important matter, and I hope we will have an opportunity of discussing that side of it before it comes to voting any money. 
    
      
       That was one of the things that was very definitely investigated, that whole question of credentials and the right to vote.  The lady who spoke&mdash;I do not know whether she spoke or voted as a representative of Canada&mdash;was the lady who organised the Self Determination League in Canada; she was elected as representative of one of the provinces, and having done the work there undertook to help in organising a similar League in Australia. She was one of the Secretaries of the Organisation. 
     
    
      
       The delegates to the conference were admitted by the Credentials Committee, representative of both sides of this House.  Therefore, we assume that their opinions were unanimous.  Whether justified or not in voting we cannot say, but the Credentials Committee is what we have to go on. 
     
    
      
       This statement in the report says that there was no delegate from Canada.  I saw a delegate at that Congress speak as a representative of the people of Canada. 
     
    
      
       The lady did represent Canada indirectly.  Whether she was appointed as such I cannot say. I do not know if she voted.  However, from the start there was a Credentials Committee appointed; nobody got in unless they were passed by that Credentials Committee, and on that Credentials Committee there were not merely representatives of Australia and of the other countries but also representatives from both sides of this Dail. 
     
    
      
       I support the Minister for Foreign Affairs in saying that, this should be referred to the next meeting of the Dail.  If the proposal that a grant be made now could be carried unanimously we would all be satisfied.  But if the vote is taken now it will be a Party vote, because the very ugly spirit which was in evidence in Paris was imported into this meeting to-day when there should be a new spirit.  The objection put forward to the postponement is grounded on the view that the grant is wanted at once, or that a vote should be taken at once so as to have it one way or the other. 
     
    
      
       There is no question of voting money before you now; you are dealing with the report. It is only a question of this report. 
     
    
      
       Mr. de Valera's objection to the grant is founded on the view that the Government should have no control over the Committee.  That view can be put before the Coalition Government, and it is very difficult to call upon this present Government to make a grant when they are not satisfied with the arrangements.  I think everything would be gained by postponing it until we have a Coalition Government, when the matter can be approached in the spirit of the Pact; whereas we are discussing it at present in the spirit of Paris, which is a deplorable spirit. 
     
    
      
       I think that instead of postponing this matter it would be much better to clear it up now, and that the Minister for Finance should do in the case of this grant what he did in the case of the grant suggested by Mr. Walsh.  There is no reason whatever why this matter should be carried on any longer.  The report is a fair one. There were partisan views expressed, as was only natural, and the hottest discussion in Paris centred round a few simple looking words.  They agreed in the report of the Association to assist the people of Ireland to attain to the full their national ideals of political and economic equality.  It is absolutely impossible to avoid a partisan discussion over that thing, and I think that those of us who stood for the maintenance of the Republic, and who wanted that to go abroad, were very mild indeed in our demand to have these words inserted so as to safeguard our position, and they could hurt nobody.  The words here are: &ldquo;The congress was not as fully representative of the Irish race throughout the world as had been intended.&rdquo; There were distinct views expressed on both sides, as was natural, and the report is a fair report; and I maintain that the postponement of this matter to   the Coalition Government does not tend for peace.  It might be settled up here now quite easily and there is no reason why even the money part of it should be postponed for a month.  There was an irregularity in proposing that the money should be spent, but there was also an irregularity in proposing that the £5,000 should be granted to the Tailteann Games.  It is curious that the irregularity was not noticed when that matter was discussed.  At the same time, I think it would tend for peace and be only fair and just if the Ministry would now vote that money for an association which eminently deserves it, and for which they can bring forward no fair reason to refuse it. 
       Another point is made of what Mr. de Valera has suggested; that is as to the Government having representation on it.  But I am astonished at the Minister for Foreign Affairs ever suggesting such a thing; if he took himself seriously he would never dream of making such a suggestion.  If he took himself seriously he would not say that the Association should be controlled by the Irish Government, and still have control of foreigners.  What foreign Government would tolerate that? 
     
    
      
       They have often tolerated it. 
     
    
      
       I know the English do it in the Rotary Clubs, but they are too clever; they do not go there as members of the English Government. If that matter was cleared up and dealt with to-day, and if the Minister for Finance would suggest to the House that this money should be paid, and not carry it on for another month, it would tend to peace; and I suggest to the House that it would be advisable to finish this matter here and now instead of carrying it on to another Government. 
     
    
      
       I quite agree that we should finish up this matter.  On a former occasion we had the assurance of the Minister for Finance that on the Committee reporting on this matter he would finish up the business.  If we had to go into it again we would be only stirring up Party feeling which would do neither ourselves nor the country good.  If there was ever a time when we wanted a united Irish nation this is the time.  We have enemies at home and abroad, and I agree with Dr. McCartan that we should not make this a controversial matter. My contention is that this Fine Gaedheal should be run independent of any Government in this country, and it would be a fatal mistake at the present time if we were to postpone it.  I think it would be only causing disappointment. I hope we will do so and throw away all Party spirit, whatever difference of opinion there may be about it, and I hope that as Irishmen we will settle this, and I hope the Minister for Finance will agree. 
     
    
      
       I seem to have been singularly misunderstood.  I proposed that the report be adopted now. There is no question of Government control.  The suggestion was that in view of the fact that on this Committee of the Fine Gaedheal there are six people representing one view of politics, and one representing the other&mdash;that there should be some persons connected with it who would be persons directly representing the Government.  Secondly, that £6,000 of Dail money has been already spent in this matter, and therefore is must be treated as a national matter, and not as a Party matter.  And lastly that when it is asking that £5,000 should be advanced for an Association which does not propose to hold its next convention until 1925, we should have a proper estimate of the money asked for, and that it should be enough to cover the present year.  I think it would be more in harmony with the spirit in which I tried to meet this thing if the matter was treated not in the way of putting to the Government an ultimatum but if something were done to have the view that we put forward embodied in the report. 
     
    
      
       I move that the question be now put, and then we can discuss this matter on a question of finance. 
     
    
      
       You have in mind the inaccurate statements made by the Press who do not understand what is at issue.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is after making a very inaccurate statement just now&mdash;that the members represented one side of politics.  There were three members of that Committee who were elected unanimously.  I was one, as Chairman; Dr. McNeill, as Vice-Chairman, and Dr. Irwin as Treasurer.   These were the only three from Ireland. The others were elected by the representatives of the Associations of several countries.  The other members are not in any sense immediately interested in our politics here, and I think it is most unfair, in view of the circumstances, to speak of it as representing one side in politics.  The three I have mentioned were chosen unanimously by the whole conference.  Dr. McNeill was chosen, I daresay, to represent one side and I represent the other.  Then again, about asking for an estimate, we are not asking you to give us a grant.  If it were a grant it would be natural to have an estimate.  What we are asking you, on the credit of the Association, is to loan us £5,000 to complete the work on which you have already spent £6,000. 
     
    
      
       I was trying to quote from the statement made by Mr. de Valera.  I was not making a complaint, but I am stating a fact.  It is true that only one member had the same view as the present majority in Dail Eireann. 
     
    
      
       I made the suggestion that it should be postponed for a month, and everything said since has convinced me that that would have been the right and proper thing to do. 
     
    
      
       It is due to me to say that I am in no way responsible for holding up any money.  It is not for me to say whether this money should be given or not.  It is for the Dail to say that.  There are two distinct matters.  One is this report to which I take only ordinary exception. The other is an estimate for £5,000, and I thought we had arranged in order to avoid contention that this matter should be left over for the moment.  I take only ordinary exception to this report. I do not think it is worth while to vote for or against it.  I would have something to say if this vote for £5,000 came up, and every member should have a right to express his opinion.  I suggest that we should let this report go through, and that the estimate for £5,000 be dealt with in the ordinary way.  I would like to give my opinions of the Irish Race Convention and I would like to give them not only to this House but to the people generally. 
     
    
      
       There is no exception taken to the report being put and passed. 
     
    
      
       Is there any objection to the adoption of the report of the Committee?  (&ldquo;No.&rdquo;). 
     
    
      
       I declare the report carried. 
     
    
      
       Gabhaim pardun agat anois.  Ni maith liom a radh gur cuireadh staincin ar aoinne.  Surely it is in order, without notice, to move that that £5,000 loan be given.  According to the Standing Orders it must be a member of the Ministry who should put such a motion, but the Standing Orders can be suspended by either ten or twenty Deputies assenting.  Is not that so? 
     
    
      
       No; the Orders of the Day, not the Standing Orders. 
     
    
      
       In order to have it discussed, some motion should be put before the House.  I take it, therefore, that it would be necessary that notice of motion be handed in this evening, and it will be dealt with to-morrow. 
     
    
      
       The proposal was to adjourn this evening. 
     
    
      
       The question of the loan has been settled by the adoption of the report.  Here is the last paragraph in the report: &ldquo;Dr. McCartan, Messrs.  Collins and Barton consider that temporary accommodation by way of a loan should be made to the Organisation.  Dr. Dwyer dissents.&rdquo; Now this report has been unanimously adopted by this body. 
     
    
      
       It was distinctly understood that the £5,000 was not included.  It was agreed last night between Harry Boland and myself that such an arrangement had been made. 
     
    
      
       I did not know that.  If I did I would not have pressed the matter. 
     
    
      
       I distinctly stated that the report be put, quite apart from the loan. 
     
    
      
       Beidh se os ar gcomhair amaireach. 
     
     
    
      
       You can do that. 
     
    
      
       When will this question of the loan be brought up next?  This looks very much like sharp practice. 
     
    
      
       I will have to make a personal explanation if this continues.  This report originated out of the charges and counter-charges, when this House was in bad temper.  Charges were made about my action in Paris.  I made an appointment with the Minister for Finance last night and in discussing this affair I thought this report might very well be left aside.  My opinion is that this Association is able to finance itself.  I would not put the Dail to the compliment of doing it. 
       The matter having been disposed of Professor McNeill resumed Chair. 
     
   
   
     DISTRESS IN MAYO. 
    
      
       There is a motion here by Dr. O'Crowley.  It is: 
       &ldquo;To draw attention to the existing acute distress in the Barony of Erris, Co. Mayo, and to move that a sum of £5,000 be made available to alleviate it immediately.&rdquo; 
       I intimated to Dr. O'Crowley that that motion was out of order for the reason that has been stated already, that it must be moved by a Minister.  It is a Ministerial motion. 
     
    
      
       Could we get out of it this way: a motion of this kind must be brought forward by a Minister, but suppose there are members of the House who feel strongly that a certain thing should be done, if there is such a feeling amonst the members of the House it ought to be possible if a private member moves a motion that the Minister for Finance be instructed to put on the paper a motion that such and such a sum be granted for such a purpose? 
     
    
      
       When the rule was drafted it was drafted in order to make it impossible for anyone but a Minister to move a money motion. 
     
    
      
       When the Orders were drafted it was with a view to preventing anybody outside a Minister moving a money vote.  Now the only way is by drafting a new Order with regard to money resolutions. 
     
    
      
       Is not this motion covered, practically speaking, by the vote of £100,000 to the Minister for Labour for the same purpose? 
     
    
      
       It was mentioned on the same day as the other. 
     
    
      
       It seems to me that the easier way would be to get out of that by having it covered by the £100,000 vote.  Could not the Deputy for Mayo tell us now&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       He is not here. 
     
    
      
       That money is being looked after and will be applied to the relief of distress in Erris. 
     
    
      
       With respect to that, we would like to know your ruling. I would like to make it as difficult as possible for a private member to raise a matter which involves the expenditure of money, so that it would secure that no money would be voted without investigation, but I would not like to make it impossible. 
     
    
      
       I protest against wasting the time of the House on this matter.  Everybody knows that if there is one safeguard it is that money should not be voted without due and proper notice.  If you have a Ministry it is the duty of that Ministry to deal with matters of that kind.  If the Ministry is unjust turn them out, but keep the business of the House in the Executive hands. 
     
    
      
       There is no doubt but the provision must have been put in here deliberately, but it is a most important one.  If every member from every part of the House could bring forward a proposal for the spending of money it would bring the financial management of the Dail practically to a nullity. 
     
    
      
       You always hear of money being safeguarded. It seems to me that we, as human beings, should think before we turn down   with a light jest this demand for money for the people of Erris.  I was there two months ago, before I left for America.  I saw the starvation.  If we have a pound to spare I would ask the Dail not to put these petty red-tape excuses between us and our first duty. 
     
    
      
       I am afraid the Deputy is speaking under a complete misapprehension.  There was a vote of £100,000.  This is a proposed vote of £5,000.  This £100,000 vote was supposed to cover the whole range of cases, including Erris. 
     
    
      
       Mr. Ruttledge was satisfied that it would, and the Minister for Local Government might have stated that. 
     
    
      
       If that had been stated it would have saved a lot of time. 
     
    
      
       I am not looking for advertisement, although I am up for election. 
     
    
      
       The next matter on the agenda is this motion: 
     
   
   
     PLACE OF DAIL MEETING. 
     &ldquo;Abhar Ruin o Shean T.O Ceallaigh, T.D. (Motion by Sean T.O Ceallaigh, T.D.). 
     &ldquo;Gurb e tuairim mhuintir na Dala do thionoladh i dtigh nios oireamhnaighe na an ait seo, abair insa Seomra Cruinn, Tigh an Ard-Mhaoir Baile Atha Cliath' mas feidir an seomra san d'fhail.&rdquo; 
    
      
       Tagan se seo beagan deanach anois.  Ni doigh liom go bhfuil puinn maith ann anois o taimid comhgarach do dheire an tSiosoin seo den Dail.  Ni theastuionn uaim acht beagan a ra.

       On a point of order, is it possible for this Dail to decide what the next Dail is to do? 
     
    
      
       It is. The next Dail can reverse the decision. 
     
    
      
       As the motion is in the form of an expression of opinion it does not matter whether it is passed or not. 
       Motion put and declared lost. 
     
   
   
     LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ELECTIONS. 
    
      
       Cuirfeadh roimh an Treas Dail e aris. 
       &ldquo;Reacht on Aire um Rialtas Aitiuil. (Decree by the Minister for Local Government). 
       &ldquo;Be it enacted that no person being a wholetime official or employee of a Local Authority is eligible for election to or membership of any other Local Authority.  Local authority meaning a Co. Borough, Borough, Co. Council, Board of Guardians or other Body being administered mainly by funds raised in rates. 
     
    
      
       I move this decree which has been suggested by the Ard Fheis last October, and in the second place by the General Council of County Councils.  The exact terminology is the suggestion of the General Body of County Councils.  That body is composed of three members of the County Borough Councils and two members from each County Council in Ireland.  This decree has been advised by practically everybody who has any experience in connection with Local Government.  It is with a view to having well disciplined officials and Boards and Councils composed of persons who   have no ulterior motive, that this decree has been moved. 
     
    
      
       Aontuighim leis sin. 
     
    
      
       There is only one comment I would like to make on this decree, and I think it ought to have a wider significance.  I think it ought to apply to the Dail itself; that any man receiving a salary or any man who could be called a wholetime official in any Department of the Dail ought not be a member of the Dail at the same time.  I think it is a practice that does not lead to good Government or to the most effective work.  I think that any man who accepts a whole time paid position under the Dail ought be prepared to resign his membership of this body, or else the position he holds.  It is not right or proper for men to occupy a dual position.  I do not refer to men who occupy positions as members of the Government, because they are giving their whole time to the work of the Government.  I think there is a difference between occuping the position&mdash;a Cabinet position, say, and the Inspector of some Department under the Local Government Board.  A man might be an Inspector, or in the Home Affairs Department, or something of that kind. I do not think that would be right or proper, and it would be well if the Cabinet, present or future, would bear that in mind in making any appointment. I do not know whether it is relevant.  I think it is relevant. And I certainly think it is a matter that ought to occupy the attention of this or any future Government&mdash; that no member of the Dail should occupy a wholetime salaried post (except such a man is a member of the Ministry). No man should occupy such a position and remain a member of Dail Eireann. 
     
    
      
       I would like to support that decree.  It is a very wise one.  I would also like to support Mr. Sean T. O'Kelly with regard to members of the Dail itself.  I think it is altogether wrong for members of the Dail to be officials of the Ministry.  Therefore, we should amend that here.  I do not say that we should amend it now, because a decree embodying these remarks ought to be well drafted and because we should see that it did not cover more than was required.  I have much pleasure in supporting the decree. 
     
    
      
       The suggestion made by the Deputy for Dublin is one that I would scarcely be entitled to embody in the decree.  The cases he refers to are few, and according to my information they are those who served us during the war period.  There are certain considerations.  It would, however, be a matter for the consideration of a future assembly as to what steps they ought to take to deal with that. 
     
    
      
       There is one remark I would like to make.  This decree does not go quite for enough, and some people would be able to point the finger of scorn at us and say we are binding them while we are prepared to allow our own members to do what we are now seeking to prevent.  I do not know that we should not make an addition to this decree, and that is that the Minister for Local Government should not be a member of any body over which he has control.  I do not think it is right.  I am not making any personal references to the present Minister for Local Government.  But I do not think it is right that being head over all the members of Public Bodies in this country he should sit upon any of the bodies over which he has ultimate control.  It detracts from his dignity as Minister, and perhaps puts him in a very invidious capacity in his position with other Public Boards in the country. I think that the matter is of such importance that it could be dealt with by the Third Dail, and that satisfactory arrangements should be made by which no Minister in the Government should be a member of a body which is controlled by himself. 
     
    
      
       As a matter of personal explanation, I should say that I offered my resignation to the body on which I have a seat, and they asked me to reconsider it.  I have not attended the meetings for a long time&mdash;once only in three or four months&mdash;and if the people there do not agree with that they could ask me to resign. 
     
    
      
       I am sure Alderman Cosgrave's services are appreciated by the Dublin Corporation but I do not think we should allow ourselves to be regarded as a lot af humbugs by   the country, passing laws for public bodies which we do not apply to ourselves. 
       Decree put and carried without a vote. 
     
   
   
     MOTION OF CENSURE. 
     &ldquo;Abhair Ruin o Chathal Brugha, T.D. (Motion by Cathal Brugha, T.D.): 
     &ldquo;Ta clu na Dala curtha fe dhimheas ag an Uachtaran mar gheall ar na foghanna droch-mhuinte a thug se fe Theachtai airithe de'n Dail: da bhrigh sin ta caineadh na Dala tuillte aige.&rdquo; 
    
      
       An mbeidh an tUachtaran annso amaireach? 
     
    
      
       Ni bheidh. 
     
    
      
       Ta rudai ba mhaith liom a ra ach ni maith liom iad a ra nuair na fuil se laithreach.  As I have said on one occasion before, we must consider charity above all things. It is not my fault that President Griffith is not here to listen to what I have to say.  I am handicapped by his absence, because his absence prevents me from saying certain things that should be said and which I am most reluctant to say and will not say now as he is not here. Now President Griffith by his attacks on certain Deputies in this Dail has brought the Dail into disrepute.  I have heard him refer to a most esteemed member of this Dail as the late member for Monaghan.  He has also referred to another most estimable member of this body as a humbug.  We then know of the several attacks he has made upon Deputy Childers, as a damned Englishman and so on.  I handed in this notice six or seven weeks ago.  One would imagine that when such a notice had been handed in he would try to restrain himself.  He has not done so.  A fortnight ago here he referred to his political opponents: some of them, he said, born in England, others of them whose ancestors came from England.  I do not exactly know to whom he refers.  But I have no doubt that it is his ignorance of Irish nomenclature that leads him into such an error, as I am not aware that we have many such in our Party.  But in any case, even if we have, it is most undignified for what ought to be the first man in Ireland, the President of the Republic, to refer to members of this body in such a way, and it would be bad enough if the man who so speaks of other Irishmen were himself a model in every way and possessed all the attributes of an Irishman.  But when I want to make myself understood by President Griffith I have to speak to him in English.  Now one would have thought that the member for Roscommon to whom President Griffith referred as a humbug would have been spared such an insult if for no other reason than what his noble sons have done for Ireland.  But it was the member for Roscommon who gathered together the various national forces that were disorganised or unorganised after Easter Week, and founded the movement that brought the Dail into existence. 
     
     In regard to President Griffith's attacks on Deputy Childers, I will say this that probably President Griffith knows better than anyone in this Dail, the valuable services rendered by Deputy Childers to Ireland.  It was Deputy Childers who brought the guns into Howth and made Easter Week possible. That was the first occasion that I met him.  Since then I have not had anything like the same opportunity as President Griffith has had of knowing and valuing his work, but I can certainly speak highly of what I do know. It was part of my duty as Minister for Defence to get the case prepared from the aspect of defence for our Delegation in London.  I had to get memoranda from various people, military, naval, and others, and I will say this that the memoranda that I got from Deputy Childers constituted such a case for Ireland that I believe that any member of this body could, from them, put together a memorandum which would convince the English people any way that they will secure greater benefits and will be in much greater security by acceding to our demands and recognising the Republic than by refusing to do so. Our delegates, apparently, were not able to convince the English statesmen.  But I believe that the English people themselves could be convinced if the memorandum were made up from the various memoranda supplied by Deputy Childers. President Griffith knows this very well.  He was in a better position than myself to know the value of Deputy Childers' work.  Deputy Childers, I know, has done other work for the   Republic with the details of which I am not acquainted, but with the details of which President Griffith is acquainted, and I say it is a most disgraceful thing that this high-minded, straight man should be attacked in such a way as he was attacked in this Dail.  The Dail, in addition, has been brought into disrepute by it.  Now my motion is this: 
     &ldquo;Ta clu na Dala curtha fe dhimheas ag an Uochtaran mar gheall ar na foghanna droch-mhuinte a thug se fe Teachtai airithe den Dail. Da brigh sin ta caineadh na Dala tuillte aige.&rdquo; 
     I will ask you to pass this resolution so that President Griffith may be taught that when he wants to exude his venom he must select some other arena in which to do it. 
    
      
       I hope the House will allow me to take advantage of this motion to make a short personal explanation, in answer to the attack made on me by President Griffith, an explanation which has been long deferred owing, Sir, to your ruling on the subject, which I do not for a moment dispute.  I am extremely sorry also that President Griffith is not in his place, and I feel a delicacy in speaking in the matter while he is not here.  Nothing I shall say will be in the least calculated to import any unnecessary bitterness into this matter, and I should be the last to make it a matter of any bitterness or controversy either.  But the House will admit that I ought have an opportunity of saying something in answer to the charges he has made against me.  At the same time I take an opportunity of thanking Deputy Cathal Brugha for the overgenerous words he has said about me. Now the statement made by President Griffith, that I was an Englishman who had spent all my life in the British Military Secret Service&mdash;that is how the statement went out to the world, and appeared in the Press of many countries &mdash;was qualified later by something he said as to my work as Intelligence Officer which was not very distinct.  Now there can be no point or object in making that charge at all, unless he had the implication in it that my position and connection here were in some way dishonourable: that in opposing the Treaty as I have opposed it I was acting not only in English interests but in some disreputable way, I suppose, as some secret agent of England.  That was the only complexion in such a charge.  Otherwise the charge would have no point at all.  I do not know how far such things are taken seriously, but it is necessary for a Deputy when statements like that are made against him, not in self-defence because I am conscious of nothing, but I am simply taking that, and repelling it and I shall use no violent language or epithets of any kind.  I want to make a very brief statement of facts about myself.  I only hope that by making it we shall put an end to this controversy which is not creditable to ourselves, or to the Dail, or to the nation. I am not an Englishman in any true sense of the word.  For one thing I have sworn allegiance to the Irish State and am an Irish citizen and no man is an Englishman who is an Irish citizen.  And in the second case I am one of those numerous cases whose parentage is mixed.  My mother was Irish and my home was in Wicklow, from a very early age indeed, because my parents died, and Glendalough became my home.  I was educated in England, like many boys in my position and in due course I used to travel over between Ireland and England, and in due course I entered the British Civil Service in the House of Commons.  There, at that early period of my life, I became thoroughly Britonised and I took that view&mdash;and as President Griffith pointed out in regard to the note he sent to the Press about me&mdash;I think an almost unprecedented step of one member of a legislature against another member of it&mdash;I took that view at the time.  He complained that I had been in the South African War and fought there.  So I did, like thousands of other Irishmen at the time.  I am sorry now I did, but one cannot re-live one's life. One can only hope by the help of Providence to grow from a wrong state of feeling into a right state of feeling, and from that time forward my life simply was this&mdash;that by a process of moral and intellectual conviction I came away from Unionism into Nationalism and finally into Republicanism.  That is a simple story.  That South African war had an effect upon my mind; it sank into it.  In a few years later I left the British Civil Service and threw myself almost entirely into working for Home Rule for Ireland&mdash;and in a private capacity, working in England&mdash;not here in Ireland but with the British Liberal Party where I thought there was some hope of doing   something.  I can just say this&mdash;that in that work I took a much more advanced view of Home Rule than was taken at that time by anybody almost&mdash;certainly by the National Party&mdash;and I published a book called &ldquo;The Frame-Work of Home Rule&rdquo;&mdash;a year after I left the British Civil Service&mdash;in which I worked out a scheme of complete Home Rule very much on the lines that are now submitted to the Dail in the form of a Dominion status.  That work I did for four years, writing and speaking and so on.  And I got so dispirited and hopeless about any chance of winning anything for Ireland by the British Liberal Party that in 1914 I took part in organising a supply of arms for the Irish Volunteers.  Then came the Great War, and like so many other thousands of men I joined the British in that war.  I wish now I did not&mdash;but I did.  Now comes point&mdash;the basis of this charge of having acted on the Secret Military Service&mdash;that I was an Intelligence Officer.  I just want to make this point very briefly and clearly to the Dail.  Every soldier knows that intelligence forms part of the work of every active unit.  My work was active service intelligence almost entirely throughout the war.  That is to say, flying in aeroplanes, taking the part of an observer with the camera, taking photos and taking maps, and making reconnaisances, reports, and so on.  That is the beginning and end of the charge, so far as I am concerned, of a secret service.  I was for a few months, as President Griffith's record says, acting as Intelligence Officer to the British Air Department&mdash;I was recalled from the Mediterranean to do that work&mdash;to sit in an office&mdash;much against my wishes&mdash;in uniform of course &mdash;and to do Intelligence work.  Then I went back on active work after that. President Griffith throws it in my teeth that after 1917 I took part in the Irish Convention.  So I did.  I was recalled from France to go there.  And I went there, still under a last lingering hope that in the terrible conditions of the time something might result of good for Ireland &mdash;that out of that Convention some good could be snatched out of evil&mdash;still on the old Home Rule lines.  Towards the end of it I became hopeless of any success in that.  Even there I took the advanced view and acted with the section of Nationalists which split off from the main section which was led by the Bishop of Raphoe and which demanded full financial independence for Ireland.  But I realised then, what I realised perfectly at the end of the war, that that era was dead and that the era of the Republic had come.  And directly I was discharged from the British Army I immediately cut off all connection with it and threw myself heart and soul into the Republican movement in Ireland.  Curiously enough, in the summer of 1919, the first mission with which I was entrusted was more or less an informal visit to Paris to stay with my friends Gavan Duffy and Sean T. O'Kelly.  And on that mission I received written authorisation from President Griffith himself, who, so far as I know, must have known substantially all the facts contained in that record published in the Press with a view to discrediting me.  In fact it is impossible to point out any definite statement in the record which does discredit me. Every statement in it is true.  Some of them have been obtained from the British Military Authorities in London. The record is correct.  It is really remarkable for what it omits, not for what it tells.  His observation of my conduct after the war: &ldquo;He served until March, 1919; he came to Ireland in the same year, and is now editor of the  Republic of Ireland. &rdquo;  That is his summary in the record sent to the public Press of Ireland and the world of my humble enough but crowded life of the last three and a half years.  I do not want to speak about that in detail at all. My friend, Cathal Brugha, has spoken of it more kindly that was necessary.  I only wish to say this&mdash;that from the very first when I offered myself and my entire time and services to the Republic I shall never forget the generous and kindly way in which I was received and the absolute and implicit trust which was placed upon me from the very first by all with whom I came in contact and who gave me responsibility which I endeavoured to fulfil.  There is no cloud whatever in that which I can see at all.  I know of no suggestion at any time from any quarter that I abused any trust and my conscience is clear that I did not.  The responsibilities were pretty heavy, probably not more than the vast majority of us here have experienced, and smaller than many of them.  Necessarily, I was in close contact with the movement, and after the arrest of Desmond FitzGerald I took his place as Minister of Publicity and published  The Bulletin  for six months after.  The financial responsibilities were very great too, but I will   not refer to them in detail.  I was duly elected Deputy to the Dail for the constituency in which my old home was, Wicklow and Kildare, in May, 1921; and after the Truce I was again entrusted with another important responsibility&mdash; that of Secretary to the Delegation in London, where I did my utmost to place at the disposal of the Delegation such knowledge as I had, and to do my honest, conscientious duty, as I saw it before me.  It was not until the Delegation returned and this bitter Treaty issue came up that any charge was made against me at all.  And the first time a charge was made against me that I was an Englishman and unfit to be in the Dail&mdash;that I was a foreigner, an alien, and also the suggestion of something worse than that, is now.  I have stated briefly to the Dail the facts of the case. I only want to add this, and again I am only sorry that President Griffith is not here to see this thing to an end once and for all.  It would be better not only for him and for me but better for the Dail and the nation if these personal vendettas could end and not be brought into public life at all.  I can see how they arise from human nature in times of stress.  I am quite willing to say, on my part, that if I can see any justification for these attacks by President Griffith, I have human understanding enough to realise that he may have felt deep resentment at my opposition to the Treaty in London.  But I did consistently and resolutely oppose it.  But I can see him completing, as he thought, the crowning achievement of a life spent in brilliant and imperishable service for Ireland and regarding me as an interloper and an Englishman and feeling bitter.  I can understand that very well.  But I for my part wish it did not happen and wish never to think of this thing again, but dismiss it from my mind and regard it as a closed chapter, if he on his side would make an expression of regret that he was led into it momentarily by uncontrolled feeling in the expressions and attacks which he put on record.  I say I should be glad to leave it at that and let it end there and get it out of the way, because I do not see that these things can do the Dail or the nation any good.  They lower public life.  We should all be willing to agree together that there are Irishmen to work for Ireland and that we are all faithful and true to Ireland and keep our own views on Ireland, and that all men are united on that simple basis that they are loyal to their country and serve it to the best of their ability&mdash;all united together and working together as Irishmen for Ireland. 
     
    
      
       Lest anybody should have thought that we on our side should want to prevent Deputy Childers from having his say on it, I should like to know if the motion is seconded? 
     
    
      
       It is not seconded. 
     
    
      
       I strongly favour putting a motion of this sort on the paper, in order that an opportunity should be given to Deputy Childers to indicate how unfair the President's remarks about him were.  I felt a double duty about him. 
     
    
      
       I again ask is it seconded? 
     
    
      
       I second it. 
     
    
      
       I wish to ask that it would not be pressed. 
     
    
      
       I will have to reply on behalf of President Griffith and the Government to the speeches that have been made. 
     
    
      
       I was in favour of this motion originally.  I think the circumstances have changed.  I will confine my statement to this: that when I came home from the United States Deputy Childers was introduced to me by the Minister for Finance. 
     
    
      
       God forgive me. 
     
    
      
       I asked him a short time afterwards to undertake the task of filling the post which had become vacated by Deputy FitzGerald.  And his work in that Department is there for everyone to see.  Later, knowing that it would be almost impossible to find in the Dail a man so qualifed for the position, I asked him to act as Secretary to the Delegation, and again the work that he did will stand for everyone to see also. I feel that I would not be acting loyally to a brilliant and devoted colleague if when he was attacked, as he was   attacked, I did not say that which I personally know.  I, therefore, state that what was said by Cathal Brugha and what was said by Deputy Childers in defence of himself, in so far as it relates to any matters of which I as President had any knowledge is true.  And I felt for myself that I had been too long silent on the matter.  Now I am sure it is not the wish of the majority of this assembly that Deputy Cathal Brugha's motion should be persisted in. 
     
    
      
       It is. 
     
    
      
       Very well.  I have made that statement.  I wish to ask Deputy Cathal Brugha to withdraw that motion.

       The reason I have for persisting in the desire to get this before the House is that three speeches have been made on one side, and in my opinion it is not right that some speech should not be made on the other side.  If there had been any graciousness there should have been the graciousness to withdraw this at the outset.  If there had been I would have answered it from our side in the same spirit.  I am not here to apologise for the particular remarks that were made by the President, nor for the particular way in which he put them.  I do not hesitate to say that that way would not be my own way.  I can only say that I believe had he been here, in the new spirit that prevails, if this motion was taken up on the one side, that he would have met it generously.  That not having been the case, I have just a few things to say.  It is all very well, at this stage, for somebody to get up on the other side and make gestures about the sanctity of public announcements.  I sat here for many days and I had the distinction of having more vitriol and poison poured on me than on any other member of the Assembly, and there was no such generous gestures from the other side then, and that is one of the things I will never forget.  We have here on the eve of an election a laudation of certain personages and after that laudation was given forth we are asked to treat the matter as not being before the House.  While these election manifestos are all right, the things that were said before the election was on the tapis for the other side, were very different indeed.  Expressions have been used on both sides that should not have been used.  But I do not believe in the sincerity of people who talk about the decencies of public debates on an occasion like this.  The motion now moved could very well have been left off if there had been sincerity in these protestations. Now, lest the public should be deceived about these things that have been said, lest they should think that everything that has been said is agreed to by this side, I wish to say that it is not.  Some of the things that have been said were the grossest exaggerations indeed, and some of us have a completely different view of the value of the work of certain people from the view that was expressed by Deputy Cathal Brugha.  I deny that the value of the work was as has been stated.  At all events, that was not my opinion of the work, and neither was it my view then nor is it now that it was the Deputy for North Roscommon who called together the national forces after 1916.  I know all   the circumstances of the calling together of those forces, and I know on whose resolution the circular was sent out to the public bodies to ask them to appoint delegates to come to a Convention to be held in Dublin.  And the Deputy who did that is in this House.  It is not Deputy Count Plunkett. 
     
    
      
       Well, I can say that I issued the circular to all the County Boards and I am personally responsible for anything that happened in the formation of that gathering.  I merely state the fact and not in my own self defence. 
     
    
      
       The proposal came from members of the Committee and all the work was done by other members of that Committee.  Yes, I know who was responsible for that work.  Again, with regard to the work of Deputy Childers, the record that has been given in the Press is, he says, correct.  Some of us have different ideas about people who went out to fight the Boers, and the Germans, and eventually destroyed the only hope we had of getting recognition for the Irish Republic.  And the thing in my mind is this: If the changes in the past and the gyrations in the past have been so great, how do we know the changes in the future and gyrations in the future will not be equally great, and will not be as frequent?  Mention was made of certain memoranda, and the memorandum put forward claimed that Ireland's neutrality would be a greater source of strength to Great Britain than Ireland's inclusion in the British Commonwealth.  I remember one day it was argued like this and the Deputy responsible for that memorandum was arguing about certain naval bases.  He said: &ldquo;Let us assume that Ireland is not there at all.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the answer was, &ldquo;but Ireland is there.&rdquo;  There is no use in talking about things like that, or assuming things that are not so.  We may not have been so eloquent in our advocacy of that document, but I would like to see the eloquence&mdash;the massive eloquence &mdash;that could persuade the British Empire that the document was as great a protection for them and their navy as anything else could have been.  I have a different opinion on that and other matters.  I have my views as to the reason for certain actions on the part of certain Deputies.  But I am not going into that now.  At any time, no matter how bitter the debate in this House, no matter how bitterly I was attacked myself, I did not desend to any form of abuse, and any thing I have to say in criticism which may be unpleasant I can say it without descending to personal abuse.  I only want to make that clear, and if this thing is pressed to the end we have a very different kind of resolution to meet it which will be a resolution expressing confidence in President Griffith and scorning the attacks made upon him, and dissociating ourselves from the action of other Deputies&mdash;action which has brought this House into disrepute. I do not care whether it is pressed to a division or not. 
       I did want to say that we were anxious to adjourn at 6.30.  It is much later than that now, and our programme was that the Dail should meet again on the 30th June, and that it should meet on the following morning, the 1st July, at an hour to be arranged, when the new Parliament should be summoned, say, for 12 o'clock.  That was the programme suggested, that the Dail should meet at 12 o'clock on Saturday 1st July, and that at that hour the roll of the new Parliament would be called. 
     
    
      
       Now that both sides have been heard, I would again ask Mr. Cathal Brugha to withdraw this motion.  We might, in the changed circumstances that have arisen, have tried to get the last motion withdrawn, if he had known of it.  The idea of the Deputy who brought it forward&mdash;I do not know whether it was inserted with his wishes in to-day's programme&mdash;was that a certain member might be given an opportunity of explanation, seeing that the rules did not provide for any other opportunity. I would like to say that I am glad the suggestion of certain members&mdash;that this was put on for electioneering purposes&mdash; is disposed of.  This was down before there was any question of the election. 
     
    
      
       Am I in order to say a word?  I would be ready to withdraw if the proposer is.  There is nothing of the insincerity in this matter that Mr. Collins has suggested.  I simply came back from America with a certainty in my mind that this was put forward for the reasons that have have been stated from outside.  The reason I did so was this, that these attacks appeared in American papers.  I was able to contradict   them and I would like to say with regard to what Mr. Collins has said of the Deputies here who have spoken during the debate on the Treaty, that, naturally, the deepest passions were aroused.  One felt things very deeply; accusations were made; expressions were used by people against attacks made on them, and naturally all that happened in a moment and it was over and done with.  There was nothing backhanded in it.  I have made no criticism of anybody's character or what anybody did. All I dealt with was the Treaty.  What I objected to was this, that that is not a direct attack on a person as to a certain matter that you disapprove of and made on the spur of the moment.  It is a deliberate attack on the man's whole past, and an attempt to try by this means to put a significance to it that it had not and to give an appearance to the world of the truth of certain suggestions for which there was no justification.  Mr. Childers' development has been perfectly direct.  Little by little, he has gone further in his love of Ireland and in his willingness to sacrifice for Ireland.  It has been a perfect development, and I as one who has been in this movement for a long time would like to say that I trust Mr. Childers and would stand by his side, and I deny these allegations.  I assert here to-day that there was nothing more disloyal in Mr. Childers, with his education, in going to take office in England than in Mr. Collins doing the same.  There was nothing against either one of them, and I would like to say that I agree with Mr. de Valera and stand by my comrade in whom I believe, and that was what I wanted to make clear when I seconded this. 
     
    
      
       I would like to answer what the Deputy for Galway, Padraic O Maille, has said.  I put in this resolution six or seven weeks ago, and I would not have put it in at all only that a couple of weeks before that another Deputy had put it in.  That was two months ago.  We were not expecting any election at that time.  I hope now that the Deputy for Galway will not be under that impression any longer.  He said there were persons here who had no Irish.  That is not his or their fault.  I did not say that it was.  He said that certain people here had not a word of Irish.  The President spoke about Englishmen and people whose ancestors came from England. I say no one should speak in that way,' and more especially one who does not speak Irish himself.  The thing that most makes a man out to be an Irishman is that he is speaking in the tongue of the Gael.  A Deputy said there was fighting going on here these last two years, and that although Deputy Childers had been fighting against the Boers and against the Germans, he did not fight at all in our own war. But Deputy Childers did other work, and he could not do that work if he had been in the fighting line.  I would not say that the work was not of more use than if he had been actually fighting in the field. Needless to say, it was not in view of the election that I put in this notice.  I sent it in seven weeks ago, and I would not have done it at least two or three weeks ago only that another Deputy had sent in another notice of motion on this matter and then withdrew it.  As he withdrew it I then put in one myself.  Had I been present when these attacks were made I would have dealt with the matter then.  I was not present on that occasion.  There are some things that the Minister for Finance has said that I would not like to answer because if I did the atmosphere would become electrified. I will say this, that he has made one statement in respect to what I said of England being more secure by acceding to our demands than she would be by refusing them.  I say that from memoranda sent in by Deputy Childers that that could be proved to the English people. 
     
    
      
       And you should go over to convince them. 
     
    
      
       And moreover, on one occasion one of our Delegates, Michael Collins, came across and stated that our Delegates would be able to prove that to the English Delegation. There is one Minister here who can vouch for the truth of that. 
     
    
      
       I would like the record. 
     
    
      
       I will not say any more.  The Minister for Finance has a different opinion now.  As my purpose has been served in bringing this matter forward I do not wish to press it any further, and with the permission of the House I will withdraw it. 
       
       Reachta on Aire um Rialtas Aitiuil. 
       (Decrees by the Minister for Local Government). 
       (a) Decree re Limerick Night Watchmen. 
       This Decree shall be cited as the Limerick Night Watchmen s Superannuation Act. 
       Be it decreed that the Corporation of Limerick may at its discretion, with the consent of the Local Government Department, grant to any Night Watchman whose whole time shall have been devoted to such employment, who has not had less than ten years' service and whose appointment the Corporation may in its discretion consider it necessary to determine, a weekly pension not exceeding in any case two-thirds of the average weekly amount paid to him as wages by the Corporation during the last three years of his discharging the duties of the said employment of Night Watchman. The calculations are to be based on the Civil Service Scale. 
     
    
      
       This Decree has been presented.  It has been under the consideration of the Department for the past nine months and I formally move it. 
     
    
      
       I second it. 
     
    
      
       That might mean that a man who has served ten years in the Corporation and might be already a pensioner might be drawing a second pension.  There are many men living to 75 and 80 years of age and if they left the service on pension and took up some other service again it might lead to a condition of things that would not be satisfactory.  Either the Corporation would not get good service or they might get that service at too great a cost.  It might be fifteen years, not ten.  It should be fifteen years. 
     
    
      
       This is an agreed Decree.  If we alter it, it might lead to confusion. 
     
    
      
       Why this Decree is being made is because there is no provision to give pensions.  They will have to retain men in their service who are past their work, and naturally this is what happens.  This is one of the ways local bodies have to take, in order to get rid of the red tape.  At any rate the Limerick Corporation is endeavouring to get over that difficulty by pensioning off the night watchmen.  I do not think Deputy O'Kelly's objection to the period does arise in this case.  The Commissioners are satisfied.  Are the employees satisfied? 
     
    
      
       I do not think I could say.  I do not think anyone could say that officials are ever satisfied.  The men have been paid, I understand, for a considerable period for work that was not performed, and I think we had better not investigate further than that. 
       With regard to the case put up by the Deputy for Dublin the idea is to get rid of the whole tribe, and that will be a matter of great advantage to the Corporation of Limerick, and to the rate-payers, on the original agreement. 
     
    
      
       Does the word &ldquo;wages&rdquo; include &ldquo;bonus&rdquo;? 
     
    
      
       Yes. 
     
    
      
       That could be stated.  What does &ldquo;Civil Service Scale&rdquo; mean? 
     
    
      
       That is to provide a case for the High Court Officials. 
       The Decree was passed. 
       ( b )  Technical Instruction (Temporary Provision) Decree. 
     
    
      
       All these Decrees should have been presented to the Dail six or eight or nine months ago.  This is in connection with the teaching of Irish.  I undertook with the Mayo County Council twelve months ago to get this Decree through.  I was in consultation with the Minister of Education twelve months ago on this matter.  Here is the Decree: 
       &ldquo;DAIL EIREANN. 
       &ldquo;Technical Instruction (Temporary Provision) Decree.  8th June, 1922. 
       &ldquo;Whereas by the Technical Instruction Acts, 1889 and 1891, the local authorities are empowered to raise certain sums of money by means of rates and to apply the sum raised thereby for the purpose of providing Technical Instruction. 
     
     
       &ldquo;And whereas by the Agricultural &amp; Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, the Council of an Urban District is empowered to raise certain sums of money by means of rates and to apply the sums raised thereby for the the purpose of providing Technical Instruction. 
     &ldquo;And whereas the sums so authorised to be raised have proved to be inadequate for the said purposes in the current financial year, and it has become necessary to increase the amount so raiseable to enable the said purposes to be effected in the present year and the administration of the provisions of the said Acts to be continued efficiently. 
     &ldquo;Be it enacted&mdash; 
     &ldquo;1.  Notwithstanding anything in any Act, the amount of the rate to be raised under the powers given by and for the purposes of the Technical Instruction Acts, 1889 and 1891 by a local authority during the local financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1923, may exceed the sum of one penny in the pound but shall not exceed the sum of two pennies in the pound. 
     &ldquo;2.  Notwithstanding anything in any Act, the sum to be raised by Council of any Urban District, under the powers given by and for the purposes described in the Agricultural and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, during the local financial year ending 31st March, 1923, may exceed a sum equal to a rate of two pennies in the pound on the said rateable value, provided that this section shall not apply to the Council of an Urban District which exercises its powers under Section I hereof. 
     &ldquo;3.  This Order may be cited as the Technical Instruction (Temporary Provision) Order, 1922.&rdquo; 
     An Act was passed called the Agricultural Act in 1889, and secondly an Act in 1891.  The peculiar phrasing of this comes on the advice of the Senior Counsel who drafted the Bill to enable local authorities to strike a rate, and eighteen Councils did it.  An omnibus Act was passed by the Dail last October, which enabled the Cabinet to do these things on condition that it was brought before the Dail afterwards. 
    
      
       I would like to second that.  It has become very necessary owing to the fact that there was no machinery by which any Council could raise money.  As a general rule claims have been submitted to us, and as a general rule they are administered by the County Committee of the Gaelic League, and by the County Committee of Aricultural Instruction.  Eighteen Councils have struck a rate and since the list was made out four other councils have struck a rate. 
     
    
      
       Part of the wording of the Decree does not seem very plain. 
     
    
      
       It is peculiar legal phraseology, which I mastered after a good deal of trouble.  That is the dope that has been served to me.  The position is this: some Councils did not adopt the second Act.  That is why the second Act is in.  In any case you are entitled to raise twopence in the pound for this, and not more.  That is why the second one went in.  I am advised it is legally sound. 
     
    
      
       It is not sufficient, I take it, for us to be told that the lawyers may take it to mean so and so. 
     
    
      
       I am in favour of this, but certainly there is no limit in it.  This will not be the first House that has passed a Bill that they did not know the meaning of, and I do not want to be put in the position of its being said of us that we passed a Bill that we did not understand. 
     
    
      
       I suggest that the words &ldquo;not exceeding a rate of three-pence&rdquo; be put in. 
     
    
      
       I cannot take it. 
     
    
      
       We are anxious to help the work of the Department in this matter, but what can we do?  We cannot make fools of ourselves in the matter. 
     
    
      
       As an amendment I would move that after the word &ldquo;pound&rdquo; we put in the words &ldquo;and not exceeding threepence in the pound&rdquo; or &ldquo;sixpence in the pound&rdquo; if you like. 
     
    
      
       I second the amendment. 
     
     
    
      
       I cannot accept any amendment.  I am faced with this that it is with a view of having the matter in order and having the thing put in legal shape that the decree is drafted as it is.  I have not been able to get our Senior Advisor because he is away.  He gives me an elaborate explanation of it.  There are two Acts, and some Councils adopted one and some another.  In this case the idea is that they are not to exceed threepence in the pound.  They will not strike more than a penny for Irish, and there was no objection in the world to leaving the thing as it stands there. 
     
    
      
       We are the legislators. It is for us to say what is right.  Whoever drafted this did not think it was to be a Decree at all.  He calls it an Order. We always legislate by Decree. 
     
    
      
       I am advised that any amendment will vitiate the Decree. 
     
    
      
       Commonsense rules in a matter of this kind.  The trouble is that we cannot possibly agree to the motion going as it is.  We are anxious to facilitate its work. 
     
    
      
       That sum might go to one shilling or two shillings in the pound. At any time an Urban Council wanted to promote anything they liked, they could saddle the ratepayers with 5/6 or 10/- in the pound. 
     
    
      
       I am suggesting that you will be responsible if the money cannot be raised. 
     
    
      
       I think you are wrong about it.  The word &ldquo;not&rdquo; is left out.  It is probably a typist's error. 
     
    
      
       I think so too. 
     
    
      
       It is possible that it is. 
     
    
      
       Your lawyer advised you carefully, and your typist probably made a mistake. 
     
    
      
       There is no power under the Technical Instruction Act to raise more than a certain amount. 
     
    
      
       Even if they leave out &ldquo;not&rdquo; it does not vitiate the Act. 
     
    
      
       If any Council wishes to raise a rate of 1/- in the pound for this purpose why should they not do so? 
     
    
      
       From the explanation he gave he suggested it was a question of 2d. or 3d. 
     
    
      
       Surely the Minister ought to be able to understand the Bill and explain it. 
     
    
      
       I have explained it, but I cannot get it into your head. 
     
    
      
       We cannot legislate upon a document about the accuracy of which we are not certain. As there is a question as to whether the proper wording of the Decree is before us or not, I rule it cannot be dealt with at present. 
       
         Decree by the Minister for Local Government. 
       
       ( c )  County Scheme (Temporary Provision) Decree. 
     
    
      
       Here is the Decree: 
       &ldquo;Whereas the existing laws for the Relief of the poor have long required amendment and alteration, and the administration thereof has recently become impossible. 
       &ldquo;And whereas in certain counties and County Boroughs the Councils thereof in order to meet the emergency so arising have reorganised the administration of such relief in accordance with schemes prepared by such Councils, respectively, and confirmed by the Minister. 
       &ldquo;And whereas until Dail Eireann shall have fully considered the amendments and alterations required as aforesaid, it is expedient in the public interest that the said administration shall be carried on for the time being in accordance with the said schemes. 
       &ldquo;Be it therefore enacted and decreed as follows:&mdash; 
     
     &ldquo;(1)  Notwithstanding anything in any enactment, the relief of the poor in every County and County Borough, shall be administered in accordance with a scheme to be submitted by the Council of each   County or County Borough to the Minister. 
     &ldquo;(2)  No such scheme shall have any force unless and until confirmed by order of the Minister. 
     &ldquo;(3)  Any such scheme shall not continue in force after the 31st day of March, 1923, or such earlier date as the Minister may determine. 
     &ldquo;(4)  This Decree shall apply to any scheme which shall have been submitted to and confirmed by the Minister prior to the enactment of this Decree, as if such scheme had been submitted to and confirmed by him after such enactment, and any such scheme so confirmed shall be deemed to have been duly and legally made under this Decree. 
     &ldquo;(5)  The expression &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in this Decree means the Minister of Local Government. 
     &ldquo;(6)  This Decree may be cited as the County Scheme (Temporary Provisions Decree) 1922, and shall remain in force until the 31st day of March, 1923, and not longer.&rdquo; 
     This is in connection with the abolition of Unions, and the setting up of County Boards of Health and the continuation of the Commission's Report that was submitted to the Dail in 1920.  It is in order to legalise the institutions set up under that report that this Decree was brought in, and I formally move it. 
    
      
       I second the adoption of that Decree. 
       The Decree was passed unanimously. 
       ( d )  Secondary Education Decree. 
       &ldquo;Be it hereby enacted and decreed as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;1.  The Council of any County or County Borough may assist by means of exhibitions, scholarships, bursaries, payment of fees or otherwise any students at any approved school in Ireland who are ordinarily resident in their County or Borough, who satisfy the Council that they are qualified to profit by instruction in such school and are in need of assistance, and who also satisfy such tests of ability as are hereinafter provided. 
       &ldquo;(2)  A School which is 
       &ldquo;(a)  either extern or residential, 
       (b)  either for the giving of secondary education or of instruction in agriculture, forestry, trade, commerce, domestic economy or other subjects of a vocational character, which may be approved by order of the Minister of Education, and shall then be an approved school within the meaning of this Decree. 
       &ldquo;3.  The tests of ability to be satisfied under Section (1) hereof shall be provided under the schemes to be formulated by such Councils respectively.  Such schemes shall be subject to the rules and conditions to be laid down by the Minister of Education and shall have no effect unless and until approved by the said Minister. 
       &ldquo;4.  Any expenses incurred by the Council of a County or County Borough under this Decree shall be paid, in the case of a Council of a County as a County at Large Charge, and in the case of a County Borough as expenses of the Council in the execution of the Public Health (Ireland) Acts, 1878 to 1907, but the amount raised by such Council in any year for the purpose shall not exceed the amount which would be produced by a rate of a 1d. in the £, on such higher rate as the Council with the consent of the Minister of Local Government may fix. 
       &ldquo;5.  This Decree may be cited as the Secondary Education Decree, 1922.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       The General Council of County Councils had had under consideration this question of scholarships.  I have reported the facts generally to the Minister of Education, as he is in a position to know more about Education than I am.  He will be able to know more about the details.  The first point is that the Councils are satisfied that this is an expenditure that they would be justly entitled to impose upon the people, and the second, that the people would be able to bear it. 
     
    
      
       I second that. It gives the local bodies power to withhold scholarships from schools and colleges that refuse to play the native games. 
     
    
      
       I support that.  In Limerick there was a strike of Secondary Teachers about two years ago.  It was   part of a general strike all over the country.  There was a Conference held and a general scheme of settlement was drawn up.  The managers generally of the schools in Limerick declined to affirm that agreement, and a strike took place.  After some time a settlement was reached and terms were made. There were about seventeen to twenty teachers involved.  In the past two years, fifteen of the teachers who financially benefited by that arrangement had been got rid of one by one until now there remains but one, and he is now under notice.  Everyone of the fifteen teachers who benefited by it have been dismissed from their employment.  Some of them have got the Birrell Bonus, and the salary in lieu of notice.  Now I am not putting that before the House as a matter that I have verified in its entirety. There are some things to be said on the part of the Managers of the schools, and for that reason I am not going to move an amendment to this.  If the Minister has recognised any secondary schools, one of the first things he would consider is, how they are treating their lay secondary teachers. 
     
    
      
       There is a system of scholarships through the Secondary Colleges to the University. There has been no system from Primary Schools to Secondary Schools, and this Decree enable local bodies to pay for scholarships from Primary to Secondary Schools.  There is a difference of work&mdash;Primary, Secondary and Technical teachers&mdash;and some have refused to prepare a regular scheme.  There have been some matters in the working of it not dealt with.  With regard to the points raised by the Deputy for Limerick, there is no existing legislation by which a school can be penalised for what he has said.  It is alleged that these dismissals have taken place as a form of victimisation.  The only intimation I have is on one side.  As things stand at present there is no method by which recognition for Secondary Schools could be refused for the reasons stated. 
     
    
      
       By arrangement with the Whip on the other side, I formally move that the House adjourn to the 30th June. 
     
    
      
       There is one other Decree that has been forgotten.  It is: 
       ( e )  Workmen's Compensation (War Addition) Extension Decree. 
       This is a Workman's Compensation Degree.  It has been adopted by every private employer.  It has not been brought before the Dail and accordingly officials of local authorities are prejudiced. The Labour Party is particularly interested in this Decree, and I got communications about it from local authorities.  It is called 
       &ldquo; Workmen's Compensation (War Addition) Extension Decree A.D.  1922. 
       &ldquo;Be it hereby enacted and Decreed as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;1.  The Workmen's Compensation (War Addition) Act, 1917, as amended by the Workmen's Compensation (War Addition) Amendment Act, 1919, shall continue in force for a period extending to the 31st day of March, 1923, and shall then expire, unless further continued. 
       &ldquo;2.  This Decree may be cited as the Workmen's Compensation (War Addition) Extension Decree, 1922, and shall be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st day of March, 1922.&rdquo; 
       Failure to pass it would seriously interfere with men who have been injured in their employment, and I formally move it. 
     
    
      
       I second it. 
     
    
      
       Why is it moved by the Local Government Department? 
     
    
      
       Because it has been considered necessary to give the officials of the local authorities the same benefits as private employers give under the Acts of the English Parliament. 
       The Decree was passed unanimously. 
       The House then adjourned to Friday, 30th June, 1922.
