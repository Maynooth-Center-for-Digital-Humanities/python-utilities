     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - MARLBOROUGH STREET TRAINING COLLEGE. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Finance if he is aware that some of the officials of the Marlboro' Street Training College regard the award of compensation which has been made to them by the Civil Service (Compensation) Committee as altogether inadequate and disproportionate to the value of the emoluments of which they are deprived by the closing of the College; whether any appeal lies from the decision of the Committee, and, if so, to whom should such appeal be made? 
     
    
      
       I cannot accept the view that the awards made by the Civil Service Compensation Committee to any of the officials of Marlboro' Street Training College were inadequate.  The awards made have generally been accepted as fair and reasonable and I understand that the Committee has even received letters of thanks from certain of the officials expressing gratitude for the fair treatment accorded by the Committee. There is no appeal from the Committee.  The Committee on which I may remind the Deputy the Government and the staffs have equal representation, has always expressed its readiness to hear applicants personally and give them every opportunity of presenting their case. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - MURDER OF MR. PATRICK COSGRAVE. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Home Affairs what steps are being taken to bring to justice the men who killed Mr. P. Cosgrave, at 124, James's-street, Dublin, on September 30th, and whether   any arrests have yet been made in connection with the crime. 
     
    
      
       Diligent police inquiries are being continued and every possible step is being taken with a view to tracing and bringing to justice the murderers of Mr. Cosgrave.  No arrests have yet been made in connection with the crime. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - BRANCH EMPLOYMENT OFFICE IN NAAS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the great inconvenience and loss to the workers affected, in having to travel from the Naas area to Droichead Nua, and, will he consider the advisability of opening a Branch Employment Office in the town of Naas. 
     
    
      
       The inconvenience and loss to workers claiming Unemployment Benefit in having to travel from the Naas area to Droichead Nua are limited to one journey only on the first day of unemployment, and are much less than in many other areas where the nearest local employment office is considerably further away.  In fact, I am informed that workers in the Naas area prefer to attend the office at Droichead Nua once a week rather than attend once only and thereafter be paid by post.  Such journeys are unavoidable unless a branch employment office is opened in every place in Ireland in which insured workers live.  That course is not practicable on financial grounds.  Having regard to the comparatively small number of insured workers, and of claimants for benefit in the Naas area, I do not think the opening of a special office there would be justified. 
     
    
      
       . Perhaps the Minister is not aware that the workers of Celbridge and Leixlip have to travel to Droichead Nua. 
     
    
      
       I am not aware of that as far as Celbridge is concerned, but I can give you some figures:&mdash;

     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - NIGHT MAIL TRAINS ON M.G.W.R. 
     
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that considerable inconvenience is caused to business people and residents in Galway and the West of Ireland generally by the discontinuance of the night mail trains on the Midland Great Western Railway; whether he is further aware that, as there is no Sunday train on this line, letters and parcels posted in Dublin or Galway on Saturday do not reach their destination in many cases till the following Tuesday; and if he will make representations to the Midland Great Western Railway Co. with a view to having the night mail and Sunday service restored. 
     
    
      
       I have been in communication with the Midland Great Western Railway Company on this matter, and am informed that the Company has, in view of the present disturbed conditions, cancelled all night trains on its system, so as to secure that all traffic is worked during the hours of daylight.  The Company withdrew Sunday trains some years ago for reasons of economy, the revenue earned from the service not being sufficient to meet its cost.  I do not feel justified at present in interfering with the discretion of the Company in these matters.  It is doing its best to maintain traffic under very difficult circumstances. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - RAILWAY TARIFF CHARGES. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the very high tariff charges on the Midland Great Western Railway, and that the cost of carrying one beast from Mullingar to Liffey Junction is £1 1s. 9d.; also, if he is aware that no reduction has been made on this railway as from war time.  Further, if it is a fact that the Great Northern Railway Co. reduced its tariff charges more than twelve months ago by 20 per cent.; and if the Government proposes taking any steps to see that reasonable charges only are made and more facilities given for goods and passenger trains; and, further, if he is aware that the unreasonable charges have a very injurious effect on the business and agricultural population. 
     
    
      
       I have been in communication with the Midland Great Western Railway Company on this matter,   and am informed that the rate of conveyance of one beast from Mullingar to Liffey Junction is £1 2s. 7d., not £1 1s. 9d., as stated in the question, but that the rate per truck load&mdash;the usual method of consignment&mdash;is £3 5s. 8d. The Great Northern Railway Company reduced its rates some time ago, not by 20 per cent., but from 120 per cent. to 100 per cent. over the rates in operation on January 14, 1920.  Owing to increased working expenses, the Midland Great Western Railway Company states that it is not possible for it at present to reduce rates, and I have no power under existing legislation to enforce reductions. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - SANCTION OF LOAN FOR DRAINAGE PURPOSES. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government whether the application of the North Dublin District Council for sanction for £300 for the purpose of draining the new Cemetery at Mulhuddart, which scheme was approved by the Local Government Department in May last, has yet been considered; and, if so, whether it has been approved. 
     
    
      
       The loan referred to has now been sanctioned.  The application for sanction was received in the Department on the 10th ultimo. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - AMALGAMATION SCHEME IN COUNTY WEXFORD. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government, if he has received a series of resolutions from the people of New Ross in connection with the amalgamation scheme in County Wexford, and in view of the attitude taken up by the people in that town will he grant the request contained in Resolution No. 2 that an Inquiry be set up immediately with a view to having any grievances of the sick and aged poor attended to? 
     
    
      
       The resolutions have been received.  Numerous inquiries were held before putting the existing scheme into operation, and the Ministry are satisfied that New Ross is adequately provided for in the matter of hospital treatment for the sick poor, as not only is there a district hospital in   the Union Buildings but there is an endowed hospital also in the town, viz.:&mdash; the Haughton Hospital; so that New Ross compares favourably in this matter with any other town of its size in Ireland. With reference to the question of the aged and infirm, the County Scheme provides that where such have friends or relatives a weekly allowance sufficient for their upkeep in decent comfort can be made by way of home help.  Where no such friends or relatives exist provision is made in the County Home.  The arrangement suggested in the resolution means the re-establishment of a workhouse at New Ross, a thing the Ministry must decline to consider. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - DUBLIN OLD AGE PENSIONERS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government if he will take steps to speed up the payments of several Old Age Pension Claims passed by the Dublin Boro' Committee within the past few months; further to ask if he is aware that this Committee meets weekly, makes careful enquiries into all claims for pensions, and if he will cause enquiries to be made into the delays that take place. 
     
    
      
       If the Deputy will give me particulars of the specific cases which he has in mind I will have enquiries made as to the cause of any delays that may have occurred. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - RELIEF WORK IN CLIFDEN. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government if he has received a resolution from the Clifden Rural District Council relative to the non-expenditure of a grant of £1,340; if he will say why the work for which this sum is available is not proceeded with; and if, in view of the necessity for relieving unemployment in that district, he will take such measures as will ensure that the work is put in hand immediately. 
     
    
      
       The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. This matter appears to be one, in the first instance, for the County Council, as the money, £1,340, referred to is apparently to be provided out of rates. The matter, however, is under investigation, and if this work has been budgeted for every endeavour will be made to put   the scheme in operation as soon as this can be done consistently with safeguarding the interest of the ratepayers. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - DISMISSALS OF REGISTERED TEACHERS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Education whether there is a growing practice among the heads of secondary schools of dismissing registered teachers in order to make room for nonregistered teachers, whom they can employ at lower salaries, even though an ample supply of registered teachers is available, and whether he agrees that such a practice is deleterious to Irish secondary education. 
     
    
      
       There is no official information available to show that such a practice exists.  Statistics furnished by the office of Intermediate Education go to show that the number of registered teachers employed in Intermediate schools in 1921-22 exceeded the number for the preceding year by about 200. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - PENSIONS OF LAY SECONDARY TEACHERS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Education whether he can state the number of lay secondary teachers, whether now in the service or retired, who are in receipt of pensions from any sources, the amounts of such pensions, and by whom paid. 
     
    
      
       There is no provision for the payment of pensions from State funds to secondary teachers as such, and no official information is available as to the number of such teachers, if any, who may be in receipt of pensions from schools or other private sources. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - THE FERMOY AERODROME. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether the work of rebuilding the Aerodrome at Fermoy has been entrusted to a local builder named T. O'Mahoney; whether he is aware that O'Mahoney had only 15 men employed on the job, and that there are a large number of workmen in the town unemployed; whether, despite the fact that this work can be done by local workmen, the Military Officer in charge   has put on to the job a number of soldiers in uniform, and if he can say what are the relative rates of pay for the men employed by the contractor and the men employed as soldiers to do the same class of work. 
     
    
      
       The aerodrome at Fermoy is not being rebuilt.  It was decided to cover one shed with corrugated iron sheets, and the work entailing the employment of 15 or 20 men at most was given to Mr. Mahoney.  His men gave trouble by refusing to hold down the sheets on the shed in a gale, and soldiers had to be put on the job in order to get it done.  Except in this case soldiers were not employed on the same work as civilians. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - AN ATHLONE PRISONER. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence to explain the circumstances by which a prisoner named Patrick Mulrennan, in Custume Barracks, Athlone, was wounded by a revolver shot, on Friday, October 6th; whether he received any medical attention after being shot, and if so by whom; where the wounded prisoner now is, and what is his present condition. 
     
    
      
       Owing to mutinous conduct of the prisoners it became necessary, in the last resort, after due warning given fourteen days previously on special parade, to fire on them.  Mulrennan was wounded, but not seriously, and was conveyed at once to the Military Hospital, where he was treated by Doctors Madden and Maguire. He is still in hospital.  His present condition is good, and he is steadily improving. 
     
    
      
       Did the officer in command give his assistance? 
     
    
      
       I do not know.  I am merely reading the reply. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - MILITARY SEARCH IN DUBLIN. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether any enquiry has been made into the complaint of Mrs. Annie Carroll, of 92, Manor St., Dublin, that on the occasion of a search by the Military of her lock-up shop during the early morning of the 29th September, a quantity of jewellery and other articles were stolen, including four watches, a gold pendant, and a pair of   field glasses, and if so, what is the result of the enquiry? 
     
    
      
       There is no record of a previous complaint in this matter.  The officer in charge of this particular search is positive that the articles were not taken.  After knocking at the house and waiting for a considerable time, he got through the window over the front door and opened the door. He placed one soldier at the front door and another at the back door, while he and a sergeant searched the house.  When leaving he shut the door behind him. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - WOUNDING AT DROICHEAD NUA. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he is aware of the dangerous and indiscriminate firing by military guards in Droichead Nua Internment Barracks, by which a boy named Matthew Hennigan was wounded on the night of the 19th instant in the public street, when numbers of people were returning from the local picture house; and whether he will take such measures as may be necessary to protect the public from such dangerous firing in the future; and, further, if he will grant compensation to the parents of the boy for any losses incurred by them. 
     
    
      
       I am informed that the allegation regarding firing from the barracks is without foundation. The wounding of Matthew Hennigan was reported at 10.15 p.m. on the 19th October. Neighbouring sentries were interrogated at once and their rifles examined, but there was no evidence as to who fired or as to the direction from which the shot came. 
     
    
      
       Will the Minister state whether he is prepared to grant compensation to the relatives of the boy for any loss they may have sustained through his unemployment? 
     
    
      
       You will have to address that question to the Minister for Defence. 
     
    
      
       I am credibly informed that another person was injured yesterday. 
     
    
      
       You can only ask questions of Ministers at this particular time. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - SPEED OF ARMY MOTOR VEHICLES. 
     
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he is aware of the careless and reckless driving of many of the men in charge of Army motor vehicles, and of the many serious accidents caused by such driving, and whether he has issued any general orders or instructions regulating the speed at which such vehicles should be driven, and the general good conduct of the drivers; and further, to ask if any penalties are imposed for such careless and reckless driving. 
     
    
      
       General orders are in being with a view to preventing the driving of military transport at excessive speeds.  A special inspectorial system exists with a view to seeing that these orders are carried out and penalties are imposed for careless and reckless driving.  Penalties are also imposed in all cases in which a man is found guilty of driving at an excessive speed unless he can produce definite evidence that it is necessary as a protection precaution. It must be realised that this tendency towards excessive speed on the part of Army cars arises mainly because of the necessity for protection against unexpected attacks. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - LOOTING AT BALLINAGORE. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence, if he is aware, that on September 24th, 1922, the house of Mr. Joseph Armstrong, of Ardmorney, Ballinagore, Co. Westmeath, was raided by armed men, and goods and chattels taken away, to the value of about £60; further, if this raid was reported at the nearest military barracks, viz., Mullingar, and, if so, what steps were taken to enquire into the matter, and with what result?  Further, to ask if the Government contemplate making any provisions whereby persons who have been looted during the disturbed times we are passing through, may be able to get compensation for their losses, and, if so, what steps should the applicants take? 
     
    
      
       Enquiries are being made into this matter, but they have not yet been completed. 
     
     
    
      
       Can the Minister state when they will be completed? 
     
    
      
       I will remind him of it. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - ARREST OF CO. MAYO LABOUR OFFICIAL. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence to state the reason of the arrest and continued detention in Costume Barracks, Athlone, of William J. Duck, Secretary, Trades Council, Ballina; and further, to ask what was his offence, and when it is intended to make a charge against him or put him on trial. 
     
    
      
       Enquiries are being made into this matter, but they have not yet been completed.

       These Resolutions are largely formal.  They are brought forward at this stage because we look upon the election of the thirty Members of the Senate as a matter of considerable importance, and because we wish to put it in the power of Deputies to make nominations immediately, and we want Deputies to have an opportunity of thinking about the matter.  Resolutions such as we have here might easily be considered when the new Dail meets, and they might easily be passed then.  If that were done the result might be that we would have hasty nominations&mdash;that is, Deputies might not consider well who should be nominated, or who, of those nominated, they should vote for.  Now, although the Constitution restricts the powers of the Senate, and although the Senate, if it were inclined to obstruct, would be prevented by the limitations imposed by the Constitution from doing very much in the way of obstructing public business, we should not on that account think it is a matter of little importance how this first Senate is to be constituted. If the institution is a success, the Senate may give the most valuable service to the country.  There is provision in the Senate for the nomination of people who will represent elements and parties that are not sufficiently represented in the Dail.  If the Senate acquits itself well and acquires the confidence of the country, these nominations to the Senate may be made the means of fusing together lines of political thought that have been heretofore entirely hostile to each other.  There will be no benefit whatever gained for the country by these nominations unless the Senate as a whole does its work well and gains the confidence of the country.  If it does that, people who have heretofore been hostile, or in political disagreement with the majority, will have an opportunity of participating in the business of the country and of giving expression to their views by adjusting their own point of view publicly. Afterwards, perhaps, some of them who would be excluded at the present moment from the Dail may so establish the fact that they can be useful public servants, that in future Dails they may have a chance of gaining the suffrage of the people.  By that means the Senate may be very useful in eliminating old differences, in bringing people to a sense of   the national position that they would not otherwise observe, and it may be the means which will greatly assist in unifying the whole of Ireland.  However, that depends entirely on the Senate being made a body which will do useful work for the country.  The Senate has not merely to consider Bills sent up by the Dail, and amend those Bills if it can get the Dail to agree with its amendment; it is a body which may consider and originate legislation which the Dail may afterwards adopt, and which, because of the fact that Ministers will not sit in it, and the routine business will not be so large, will have an opportunity of considering legislation to a greater degree than the Dail.  It is desirable, if we have a Senate, that it should be a well and wisely constituted body, and that it should do all the service which it can do if it is so constituted.  It is for these reasons that we put forward the Resolutions that are on the paper at this early date in order that nothing may be done hastily in the matter of choosing the 30 elected Members of the Senate.  There are very few points that could be regarded as controversial in the Resolutions themselves. They are entirely along the ordinary lines. In the Schedule there are special rules as to the method in which the count is to be conducted: That adjustment in the system of Proportional Representation, or in a detail of it, as we know it, is necessary because of the fact that the electorate is very small and that the quota will be perhaps two, or two and a decimal.  All the members of the Dail know that under the system of Proportional Representation to which we are accustomed here the quota is arrived at by adding one to the number of vacancies, dividing the total vote by that, and adding one to the result. When you are dealing in thousands of votes nothing is put astray by adding one to the result.  But when the quota will be two, or two and a half, or three perhaps, the whole business is knocked astray if you have to add a figure that is practically half the total.  There are other provisions.  There is the provision in the Schedule, in Rule 5, for ascertaining the order of preferences.  That is a new rule that will not be found in any of the ordinary Proportional Representation rules.  That is necessary because it is likely that of the thirty candidates to be elected, a large number who will   be ultimately elected may not obtain any votes on the first count.  If some device like this were not adopted it would largely depend upon chance who would be elected, because out of the large number who had received no preference votes or who might be equal, without a quota you would have to draw lots as to who would be eliminated. The system laid down here is a system too complicated for general use.  It could not possibly be adopted for Parliamentary elections.  But where the total number of votes cast will be perhaps eighty or so it presents no difficulty; it leaves absolutely nothing to chance. Then it establishes definitely by a scrutiny of the entire papers the order of preferences.  That is necessary, not only to prevent people being excluded by chance by the drawing of lots, but it is necessary also to establish in a way that cannot be disputed or challenged, the order in which successful candidates may be elected.  The first fifteen candidates to be elected will have a term of office of 12 years.  The remaining 15 will have a term of office of only 6 years. And it is a matter of importance, therefore, that the person who might be number 14 on the list shall not by any defect in the system of counting be returned as sixteenth on the list.  These rules are rules that were devised in the first instance for the election of the Senate under the 1920 Act.  This clause 5 has been introduced because of the desirability of making the rules more mathematically accurate than they were originally and for the purpose of establishing the order of preference more definitely.  There are a couple of other small amendments in them, but in the main they are the rules that were adopted at that time.  These rules as they stand have been submitted to the Proportional Representation Society, and have been approved by them.  It might not be possible for the Members at one reading to grasp fully all the implications of the various provisions, but they have been most carefully considered.  A trial election has been carried out under them, and the Deputies who are not sure of their own knowledge may take it that they are watertight. The only other thing that might require mention is the provision No. 8 in the resolution, &ldquo;that the voting shall be by secret ballot.&rdquo;  It is thought that that   would be the best way of getting as good a Senate as it is possible for this Dail to elect.  If these resolutions are adopted by the Dail in the form in which they stand, no restriction will be placed upon the number of candidates whom any Deputy may nominate.  There may be a large number of Deputies who may not wish to nominate any candidate.  Every Deputy who nominates a candidate must obtain the consent of that candidate.  A Deputy can give only one single first preference; and it might happen that some Deputy who had asked a number of people to consent to be nominated, might find that some of them were not elected, and there would be, perhaps, heart-burning on the part of the person who was rejected when that person saw that the very Deputy who had requested him to go forward had not given his first preference for him.  This membership of the Senate is not an office of profit.  Deputies, in voting for it in this first election, are very much in the position of the electors in the country who would vote by secret ballot.  They are, in fact, not so much acting in the ordinary way in their representative capacity as taking for the present the place of a group of electors or the place of the electorate.  In the ordinary way electors of the country will elect the Senate by secret ballot.  It is impossible to have an election of the Senate carried out in that way at the present time.  The Dail is doing it as nearly as possible in the same way, with, as I have said, modifications in the matter of counting.  I think there is nothing to say further about these rules.  If they are passed to-day, it would be possible at once for any Deputy to put in a nomination or nominations, and it should be possible to have all the nominations scrutinised. Members may have their minds made up and can advise with their friends, and when the Parliament meets after the Constitution comes into operation, it would be possible to proceed at once with the election of the 30 members of the Senate.  The President then, or before that time, would be able to announce his list of nominations.  The first Senate could be constituted at once, and the Oireachtas can go on with its work without any further delay. 
     
    
      
       I second the motion. 
     
    
      
       I just want to raise a rather technical point on this.  It   seems to me it would require some consideration from the legal side, as it may lead to certain constitutional difficulties later on.  As I read these Resolutions, there will be two different electorates, one of which will be entitled to nominate members of the Senate, and the other electorate will be entitled to elect the Senate.  I can conceive of Members being fully qualified, on these Resolutions, to nominate a Senator, and being disqualified from taking part in the election of that Senator, and I suggest that that would be an impossible position to place ourselves in, if you had a considerable number nominated by men who are not qualified to take part in the election. 
     
    
      
       I think the Deputy is labouring under a misapprehension.  I do not think that that is so. 
     
    
      
       I will be very glad if it is made clear.  It is laid down here that the nominations are to be sent in by Members of this Dail who have signed the roll.  The nominations will close at twelve o'clock on the day of the coming into force of the Constitution.  After that, I take it&mdash;I may be wrong, and I hope I am wrong&mdash;that the Dail will not be constituted of any person who does not sign the oath or take the oath, and it will be only those members who have taken the oath who will be qualified to elect Senators; so that you have two different electorates, and you may be placed in the position where half the nominated Senators are nominated by Deputies who are not capable of voting.  I suggest that the whole procedure either should finish before the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution, or it should begin after the coming into operation of the Constitution, but it is quite impossible as it stands, inasmuch as it is divided between two sections, the dividing line being the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution.  I think that that ought to be got over by having the whole process completed before this date that is mentioned.  Then, if it is required to have formal ratification afterwards, let that be done, but as it stands it is liable, perhaps, to cause a good deal of trouble, inasmuch as there are two separate qualifications, for the nominator on the one hand, and for the elector on the other.  Another small point is that the time will end at 12 o'clock noon on the day of the coming into force of the   Constitution.  Well, that is an indefinite date, and we are not likely to know that date until after it has transpired, and I suggest that it should be the day after the announcement&mdash;the day after the proclamation.  However, that is a smaller point than the other.  I think the other is a substantial objection, that would make the passing of this resolution possibly a farce. 
     
    
      
       The provisions made for the nominating and electing of members to the Senate follow, of course, the Article with regard thereto as passed in the framing of the Constitution, and very admirable specimen forms are provided in the Schedule here to guide Deputies in the making of nominations.  On a study of these specimens a difficulty occurred to me which I have no doubt the Minister will very readily remove.  I mention it to him now because it may have occurred to others.  In the Article of the Constitution which we enacted it is stated that the Senate is to consist of citizens who have deserved well of the country.  I think the words used are not exactly those that I have employed, but are rather, &ldquo;who have done honour to the country,&rdquo; and two further classes are by implication indicated, they who have become representative in some way of valuable elements in the Nation's life. Now, what in the concrete this will actually prove to be is outlined in the form of nomination paper which is put forward here as a sample.  For example, &ldquo;Alexander Devereux&rdquo; is nominated and his nominator gives as the grounds for his nomination a statement of his useful public services.  For instance, he was President of a Chamber of Commerce and founded an Industrial Development Association, and so on.  Now that is one type.  Then another is nominated and the ground for recommending him to the electors is that he is the author of notable Irish standard historical works.  You will see that is quite a different type of qualification.  Then the next is he who was President of such and such a social guild and was first to secure the establishment of school clinics in Irish Elementary Schools. These are different species of public services. Now I can well conceive of a Deputy nominating such a trio and giving as the grounds for his selection just such grounds as these.  When we   come to vote, if I do not misunderstand the scheme, a Deputy votes for only one of those.  He gives his first preference vote to one and only one, although he may have nominated these three, and although it may be deemed highly desirable that the Senate should combine different sorts of representative Irishmen, as indicated in these outlined qualifications.  Now, that seems to me, if I do not wholly misunderstand, a serious deficiency in the plan.  I would like to suggest, if there is any room for the suggestion, that when all the nominations have been received, that a Committee should work over these, and, as far as possible, classify them, and then the scheme should provide for voting as between different candidates under each of the separate categories.  Otherwise we should be like Buridanus's ass, and remain without recording our votes because of the equal attractions of two candidates. 
     
    
      
       One finds some difficulty with regard to this Resolution that has been placed before us, a difficulty that the Minister who moved it has already anticipated when he stated that Deputies might not be able to grasp the full import of the resolution in some of its details.  Personally I did not see a copy of this until this morning.  It is possible that some Deputies saw it before. Deputy Johnson has already indicated two matters, one of very considerable moment, one an improvement of a definite kind, and it is possible that if greater opportunity had been given Deputies to go over this, certain other faults might be discovered.  I hope that it is not impossible that this may be taken later on in the ordinary course that we have hitherto adopted for Bills, that is to say, it may receive here First and Second Readings, and that there should be a subsequent Committee stage, because while it is actually a Resolution and not a Bill, we know that, in practical effect, it is a Bill put into resolution form so as to avoid some of the difficulties which are purely of a diplomatic and technical kind that are attendant upon Bills brought forward before the Constitution has actually been prescribed.  I think it would be desirable that there should be a Committee Stage upon this.  It need not occupy a great deal of time, but, on the other hand, it may be found that   it would occupy some time, and there may be some improvements to suggest in the course of the various paragraphs of this Resolution, because this election is a very important matter.  A Senate is brought into being that will last&mdash;or some part of it will last&mdash;for twelve years.  The persons who compose that Senate will exert a very considerable authority in the future of this State.  We know that the Senate does not actually function very strongly or very markedly under the Constitution, but it has got a curious function of its own.  It will have a power which it will be able to assume for itself, according to its dignity and according to its knowledge.  If it be composed of the kind of persons we would like to see there, there is no question that the Senate will exert a very considerable authority in the Free-State.  I mention only one of these.  There are provisions in the Constitution for the exercise of the Referendum.  I have stated here, and I repeat it, that the Referendum in the normal course, by petition, is practically inoperative. As we have put it in the Constitution, if the Referendum is to be exercised it will be exercised by the vote of the Senate.  In other words, the Senate will have entrusted to it the right of calling in the entire people of this country against decisions of the Dail, and I hope the Senate will frequently exercise that right, if only to discover at various stages of the Dail's authority whether it is exceeding that authority, or whether it is keeping well within it.  It is a very considerable power to bestow on the Senate, and it is right at this stage of elaborating the machinery by which the Senate will be elected to take great care to see that we get the right kind of persons. One welcomes the assurance of the Minister moving this Resolution that before any voting takes place the President will let us know exactly who are to be the thirty persons whom he will propose, under the transitional provisions of the Constitution, before the Dail votes upon the other thirty.  We passed a Resolution here the other day by which the President was to take counsel with a certain number of bodies in the country before he put his thirty up on nomination. I venture to say that one of the bodies that was not mentioned in that earlier Resolution, but which we all had in our minds, was his own party, which would   necessarily have a very considerable influence in his decision in that matter, and it is worth consideration, and is not quite beside the point, that whereas his own party will actually have a large say in the nominated half, it will have an equally large say, because of the size of it, necessarily in the half that is to be elected by this body.  I suppose that is inevitable, things being as they are.  I merely draw attention to that fact, because it may prove to be a fact of some moment.  It has been suggested several times in the country since the Constitution was first published that the Senate would give an opportunity for minority representation.  It has also been suggested that the Senate would give an opportunity for the election or the nomination of persons who have hitherto been known as Southern Unionists.  I think I am right in saying that that suggestion has not been put forward by those who have been hitherto known as Southern Unionists.  I recollect a saying of Deputy Fitzgibbon in this Dail, and I suggest it is germane to this matter, because it will guide the use made of this machinery, that there is no question at any time of anybody in this country seeking a privileged position; that whoever gets elected will get elected by his or her own merits. Those merits may give people of special training an opportunity of election to the Senate that others not so fortunate might not have, and I imagine that there may be some prejudice against the election of that kind of persons, because of political faith or unfaith that they had in the past. But there are names that will occur to all of us here of persons we would like to see elected to the Senate, no matter what their previous records have been, because their services have been eminent, their qualifications are special and peculiar; but I am not sure under these provisions that we have in this resolution exactly what protection there is in order to see that all parties of peculiar interest in this country will get fair representation. What I mean is this: If the entire body had to be elected I believe it would be true that the entire Senate would be more justly chosen than by the method that has been adopted in the Constitution. And I believe the same would be the case if the entire body had to be nominated, because if the President had to nominate, or any person had to nominate   the entire Senate of sixty, he would select people of a special kind, so as to form a uniform whole on the lines that have been suggested by Deputy Professor Magennis. Therefore I would like if the Minister would give us some indication before we come to the voting, in accordance with the provisions of this Resolution&mdash;or if the President or the Ministry would give us some indication as to how the original thirty&mdash;the nominated thirty&mdash;came to be appointed, because the actual choice preceding the election in each Deputy's mind will be one of very considerable difficulty.  That difficulty can be largely removed if we know, for example, the Chamber of Commerce in Dublin having put up three persons, that we in proceeding to the election of the second thirty can have some kind of assurance that that part of the national life had been exhausted in the nominated half, or alternatively if an engineering body were to put up a certain number of names to the President and the President decided on their nominations and accepted these names. He put up so many persons as representing the engineering profession which would enable this Dail when it came to this half of the thirty to feel that that portion had at least been more or less exhausted, and that therefore this Dail would be able to consider those parts of the national life that did not come under the President's thirty.  For that reason I hope we will be able to have an assurance whether this be passed to-day or whether it will be postponed to a later Committee stage&mdash;and I take it there is no matter of violent hurry in it&mdash;that we will at least have the President's nominated thirty in our hands a full week before any elections proceed, and if possible at least a full week before the lists of nominations are closed under the provisions of this Resolution. 
     
    
      
       There is some little point in the matter raised by Deputy Johnson.  He made a somewhat different criticism from what I thought he would.  However, I think it is not one that need trouble us very much.  It may be, I suppose it is a fact, that there are certain members of this Dail who will not continue to be members of the Dail after the passing of the Constitution, and it may be that those members, if these Resolutions are adopted, will make nominations for the Senate.  I do not   think that that matters a great deal.  If the nominations are nominations that commend themselves to the Dail the people nominated will be elected, and if they do not commend themselves to the Dail they will not be elected.  The actual nomination is not a serious matter.  All that is required is that people should have the power to put names forward; that it be the duty of members of this Dail, if they think of anyone suitable, to put the name forward, and that somebody should have the duty of approaching people who they think would be good members of the Senate, and asking them to act.  Whether a few members leave this Dail after the passing of the Constitution or not I do not think really is a matter of very serious import. In any case the alternatives involve disadvantages. I do not believe that under the Constitution&mdash;in fact, I think it is clear that under the Constitution we could not nominate or elect the thirty members of the Senate until this Dail has ceased to be the House of the Provisional Parliament and has become the Chamber of Deputies of the Free State.  I think it is definitely laid down in the Constitution, and I think it is perfectly clear, that it is not this Dail, as it stands at present, that has the power of electing the Senate, but the Dail of the Oireachtas of the Free State.  Consequently the matter cannot be entirely done before the Constitution comes into operation. 
     
    
      
       May I point out that the resolution speaks of the time for election, and the voting only comes into operation after that time has expired? 
     
    
      
       That is a verbal point. 
     
    
      
       It may be very important later on. 
     
    
      
       The alternative of postponing the entire business until after the Constitution has come into operation is, to my mind, a disadvantage, as it would lead to the matter being done with a rush&mdash;being done, probably, without very careful consideration.  I think, unless it is possible to make nominations and to put the fact to Deputies that nominations are being actually made&mdash;unless it is possible to put the names of people who have been actually nominated and who are candidates before the Deputies of the Dail, a very considerable number   of them&mdash;and I know this from some conversations&mdash;they are not likely to give very much consideration to the matter. I think the postponing of the whole matter, or the postponement of any nomination until after the Constitution has come into operation, would mean that the matter would be rushed through in a day or two, or it would mean the Constitution of the Senate would have to be delayed perhaps for a fortnight or more, and I think that would be undesirable. There is a small point in this matter, and I do not believe it is one that constitutes any serious difficulty, and I do not say that it can lead to any difficulties later on.  Deputy Magennis's point was one that was considered, but we did not see that it was practicable to devise any system of voting by lists that would meet the present difficulties.  I think, that if a Deputy finds three or four people nominated, all of whom he desires to see returned, he will have to canvass his friends and he will give his first vote to one of the three or four. He will have to persuade his friends to give their vote to the others.  That difficulty is one of the arguments for conducting this election by secret ballot. It is also, to my mind, an argument against having the election rushed by postponing the nominations until the Constitution has come into operation. I believe it is a fact that if nominations were made after the Constitution came into operation there would be a desire to finish the business off at once.  If the Oireachtas were able to do business, then arrangements between Deputies could be made which might be necessary to get the candidates that ought to be returned, actually returned, and to get the consideration given to the question of establishing a balance in the Senate, that ought to be given.  That would be lost sight of in the welter.  With regard to what Deputy Figgis said, I am sorry that the Resolution was not in the hands of Deputies sooner.  It was hardly my fault.  I think there were some difficulties with the printers and that the usual overtime was not being worked. Otherwise Deputies would have had it sooner.  If there had been any considerable difficulty about any point in the Resolution, I would see no reason for being opposed to going into Committee, but as a matter of fact, I think, that at the moment nothing has been said   that would point to the necessity.  Deputy Johnson suggested that the nominations should be received until noon on the day after the coming into force of the Constitution of Saorstat Eireann.  I think that that is quite reasonable, and as far as I am concerned, I would be agreeable to receiving it.  There might be a slight consequential amendment in a later clause as to the day on which the voting would take place, or the matter could be met by adjourning the meeting of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       It does not affect the meeting of the Dail.  The meeting of the Dail takes place on the day after the coming into force of the Constitution. 
     
    
      
       It could be met by holding back the meeting of the Dail for another day.  With that change, I would suggest to the Deputies that it would be better to pass the Resolution to-day. There is a short time now, and I think it is necessary that as soon as possible nominations should begin to be made, and Deputies should begin to consider how they would like to constitute the Senate and who they would like to vote for. 
     
    
      
       We had better get the proposed amendment in writing inserted. 
     
    
      
       May I suggest that you substitute the word &ldquo;after&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; in the fourth line of page 77, after the word &ldquo;day&rdquo;&mdash; i.e. , the noon on the day after. 
     
    
      
       That would do. 
     
    
      
       May I ask a question with regard to page 82, Section 9, Sub-section 2 (a)?  This is a provision for dealing with the exclusion of the lowest candidate: &ldquo;The parcel containing original votes shall first be transferred, the transfer value of each paper being one thousand.&rdquo;  Does that mean, when A.B. is declared excluded, that all the papers on which votes are recorded for A.B. are to be transferred, first, as parcels containing his first preference, and secondly, as sub-parcels containing second or third preferences over other candidates already elected?  How will original votes for A.B. be transferred? Is the idea that what was a second vote in such a case is to count practically as a first vote for the continuing candidate?  If so, this is a decided   departure from the whole doctrine of Proportional Representation. 
     
    
      
       This system, I may say, of the giving of the value of 1,000 to each vote was adopted a considerable time ago.  The original votes would be transferred at their full value in the case of an excluded candidate.  The quota is 200.  The candidates might have a value of 1,000.  That would be transferred at its full value.  Then he would have got another vote at the value of 200; that would be transferred at the value of 200. 
     
    
      
       It is not intended to transfer his original votes.  It is worded so as not to convey that. 
     
    
      
       All votes are to be transferred at the value they hold at the time of transfer. 
     
    
      
       The machinery of Proportional Representation is so delicate that any interference with the machine is likely to produce unexpected results, and the proposal made by the Minister for Local Government that we should canvass for those that we would like to support may have very dangerous results in this case.  I should like to give my preference vote to the man who introduced a clinic into the elementary schools.  I think that is a priceless service to the nation. 
     
    
      
       Name? 
     
    
      
       I should like also to vote for the man who is the founder of the Industrial Development Association.  Am I to vote for the one and canvass for the other?  If so, I may canvass so assiduously for the other as to defeat my benefactor.  It seems to me that the Ministry is not so devoid of ability as is professed.  I think they can provide a scheme by which lists could be set out and allow us to have preferential votes for a number not exceeding six. There are 30 candidates.  It is very different in the case of candidates, all of surpassing merit, to give preferential votes. 
     
    
      
       A trifling verbal amendment is required in Resolution No. 7.  You are to set out in the notice of the nomination a statement of the persons who have rendered useful public service, or who possess special qualifications in reference to important aspects of the Nation's life. Now, the form of nomination given on page 86 appears to contemplate   a third matter&mdash;namely, his attainments. You have got there &ldquo;Statement of useful public service or special qualifications or attainments in the aforesaid,&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;attainments&rdquo; has been left out by oversight in Resolution 7. 
     
    
      
       The nomination states &ldquo;special qualifications or attainments.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       I suggest the word &ldquo;attainments&rdquo; may be added there after &ldquo;public service.&rdquo;  I do not know whether &ldquo;attainments&rdquo; is a proper word to use, in reference to important aspects of the Nation's life.  I should think &ldquo;attainments&rdquo; referred to individuals themselves. 
     
    
      
       Achievements. 
     
    
      
       Well &ldquo;attainments&rdquo; is the word used. 
     
    
      
       You see the wording in the Constitution is &ldquo;The Senate/ Seanad Eireann shall be composed of citizens who shall be proposed on the grounds that they have done honour to the Nation by reason of useful public service, or that, because of special qualifications or attainments, they represent important aspects of the Nation's life.&rdquo; I accept the amendment. 
     
    
      
       I want to raise the question whether it is desirable to state these things on the nomination form, because nobody is going to believe what the nominator says about the person nominated.  It may because of &ldquo;you scratch my back and I will scratch your back.&rdquo;  If I want &ldquo;to wipe the eye&rdquo; of a particular person, I will say he has done splendid things.  If I want to &ldquo;touch&rdquo; a man for a five-pound note, I will give him a testimonial for things he has done, but no one will believe it; and to put that as a reason, when we are all sure that we are not going to believe a testimonial in such a case, is rather futile and is a waste of paper, ink, time, and the hilarity of the Deputies.  The name will be sufficient, and if the candidate is going to canvass you, you can leave it to himself to tell all the particulars about his attainments and his qualifications; but you should not ask the nominators to make such a statement in the nomination paper.  Well, you may want very many large sheets of paper, because the people we will nominate   will have the most wonderful qualifications, and they will require a full explanation and description, and that might take a very long time, and I really suggest that it is not at all necessary, and is perhaps undesirable, that we should be asked to state the qualifications in the official form, whatever we may do in private advocacy amongst the Deputies of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       For the purpose of ordinary elections the Constitution lays it down that candidates shall be proposed on the grounds that they had done so and so.  The difficulty is that Deputy Johnson did not think of this in time. 
     
    
      
       In the course of the Constitution debate it was suggested that there would be no means to determine whether they would have these qualifications. 
     
    
      
       It would prevent many bogus nominations being accepted. 
     
    
      
       Would the Minister accept a limitation in the number of words used? 
     
    
      
       I was wishing that those that were short would be read, and that those that were long should not be read. 
     
    
      
       It is right to say with reference to Deputy Magennis's point that this particular method adopted here gives you an exact result from the point of view of Proportional Representation as against the result achieved by the ordinary methods adopted, and I think that Deputies will appreciate its value. 
       Amendment to Paragraph 4, page 77, to insert after the word &ldquo;day&rdquo; the words &ldquo;following the day,&rdquo; proposed by Deputy Johnson and seconded by Deputy Hughes, put and agreed to. 
     
    
      
       Deputy Fitzgibbon has proposed to make Paragraph 7, page 77, column 2, come into line with the Nomination Paper. 
       Amendment to Paragraph 7, page 77, to insert the two words &ldquo;or attainments&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;qualifications,&rdquo; proposed by Deputy Fitzgibbon and seconded by Deputy Magennis, put and agreed to. 
     
    
      
       With these two amendments the Resolution is before the Dail.  We will put the Resolution   now formally, with these two amendments. 
       Resolution put and agreed to. 
     
    
      
       With regard to the portions of the Resolution that concern me as Returning Officer, I propose to receive nominations at the Clerk's office here, on and after tomorrow, Thursday, the 2nd November, and every succeeding day, except Saturdays and Sundays, during the time of   election, between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., and 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., save that on the day after the day of the coming into operation of the Constitution of Saorstat Eireann, the hours for receiving nominations shall be from 10 a.m. to 12 noon. I will get a notice to that effect posted up for Deputies; nomination forms are printed and will be available from now onwards in the Clerk's Office, and each Deputy can nominate as many candidates as he pleases. 
     
   
   
     COMPENSATION CLAIMS. - MOTION BY MINISTER FOR FINANCE.

             &ldquo;THAT INASMUCH AS some time must elapse before the coming into operation of the legislation which must be passed by the Oireachtas of Saorstat Eireann for giving effect to the resolution of this Dail of the 22nd day of September, 1922, but it is the desire of this Dail that the claims for compensation in respect of damage to, or destruction of, property inflicted since the 11th day of July, 1921, should be heard and determined with such expedition as is compatible with a just measure of relief to the sufferers.

             THIS DAIL is of opinion, and hereby instructs the Ministry, that, pending such legislation as aforesaid, all such preliminary steps as would necessarily or properly be taken by the Minister for Finance (were such legislation as aforesaid already in operation) with a view to a speedy hearing and determination of the said claims, should so far as possible be taken without delay, and particularly that all proper arrangements be made for receiving, classifying, and registering the said claims in such forms and subject to such relevant inquiries as may be prescribed by the Minister for Finance, and that all such claims shall be examined under the authority of the Minister for Finance with such legal and expert advice as he may think expedient and information and evidence relevant thereto collected by him, so that the hearing and adjudication of the said claims (when the same may be lawfully commenced) shall be prosecuted with the utmost expedition.&rdquo; 
           
         
       
     
     
        That is the form of the Resolution I propose.  I would remind the Dail that on the 22nd September a Resolution was passed approving of the principle that while a proportion of the compensation which will be recoverable in respect of damage to or destruction of property inflicted since the 11th day of July, 1921, being the date of the Truce between the Forces of Great Britain and Ireland, should under approved conditions be borne as a National liability, nevertheless a date should be determined as from which such liability should remain wholly a burden of the local authorities now primarily responsible for the same.  In order that the general arrangements contemplated by this Resolution, under which compensation will be given in cases of post-Truce damage to or destruction of property, may be carried into effect, it will be necessary for the Oireachtas of Saorstat Eireann to pass legislation in due course. That is a point that must be borne in mind, that the present law is insufficient to deal with such cases.  It is, however, I believe, agreed on all sides that it would be very undesirable to do nothing, pending such legislation, in the way of making the necessary advanced preparations for having awards speedily determined and discharged when the proper time arrives.  In a matter such as this the mere work of ascertaining the particulars of claims and examining them with reference to the conditions which must govern eventual awards is extremely laborious, and there is a great deal to be gained by proceeding at once with the completion of this preliminary task in a manner which will not prejudice final awards.  Under the present Resolution it is proposed immediately to make a prescribed form of claim available on application to offices of the County Councils, on which all persons claiming compensation in respect of post-Truce property damage will be required to set forth all relevant particulars under such heads as will facilitate speedy examination when the matter comes before the County Court.  These forms should be available in a few days. In view of the heavy financial liability which it is proposed that the State should undertake in this matter it is intended that on the hearing of claims a special solicitor for each county should be entitled to appear on behalf of the   Minister for Finance.  All claims received on the prescribed form will be made immediately available to this solicitor and such expert staff as it may be necessary to place at his disposal, so that they may have an opportunity of making adequate investigation into all the facts before the matters come into Court.  Claims on the prescribed form will also be directed to be sent to local authorities and to County Councils so that their solicitors and officers may also have full opportunity of investigation.  The solicitors acting for the Government will, it is hoped and believed, act throughout with the fullest harmony and co-operation with the officers of local bodies and in such a manner as to secure that the best possible local information is always available for checking claims. It is the view of the Government that by proceeding in this manner we are making the most effective arrangement that is reasonably practicable for expediting the settlement of this important problem and relieving the natural anxiety of sufferers throughout the country. There are two main sides to this question&mdash;namely, as regards the machinery to be employed for assessing compensation, and as regards the basis on which the assessment should be made.  I am not at present dealing with the question of the basis, but I may say that the several points arising in this connection have been very fully examined, and that preparations in this respect are well advanced for embodying our proposals in the legislation to which I have referred. The question of machinery is practically settled by the present Resolution, taken in conjunction with the fact that the claims will be heard by County Courts, we expect, early in January.  The fact that in the County Courts we shall have a large number of tribunals working simultaneously on uniform lines in this matter should secure that the compensation is made available much more rapidly than if we were to set up a special Commission or tribunal for the purpose.  The spreading of the preliminary work of investigation among bodies of officers working in the several counties is an important factor.  In the case of the Shaw Commission it has been found by experience that the enormous volume of claims has itself constituted a big problem in the merely mechanical sense, quite apart from the labour of   determining awards.  It is largely on this account that it is only now, after several months' work, that the awards of this Commission have begun to come in in any considerable number.  It will be remembered that when making a financial statement in the Dail on the 6th of last month I indicated that with improved procedure the number of awards of the Commission was on the point of expanding rapidly.  As an indication of this I am now glad to be able to inform the Dail that within the last few days we have received from the Commission notification of a batch of 113 awards, and that the advertisements preliminary to payment in these cases are being published at once.  I may say also that satisfactory progress is now being made in disposing of defended pre-Truce claims for property damaged, and that 89 of such claims were advertised for payment on the 18th of last month.  I think the amount involved in connection with the 113 cases would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £300,000, and we have already advanced in other cases something in the neighbourhood of half a million, so that we are rapidly mounting up towards one million in connection with the amount of money we have made available in these cases.  I formally move the adoption of this. 
    
      
       I beg to second the motion. 
     
    
      
       I think it is commendable on the part of the Minister to have taken steps to expedite the hearing of such claims as will be sent in for losses consequent upon the damage or destruction of property inflicted since the 11th July, 1921; and we shall support the Motion, provided that there is an agreement to include, not merely the damage or destruction of property, but also claims for loss of employment consequent upon such destruction. We have had to complain and regret that the Shaw Commission, at any rate, decided that it was not possible for them to include the loss of wages following destruction.  But I hope it will not be the decision of the Dail that we should follow that bad example.  It is lamentable and tragic that so much damage has been done to property&mdash;property of a kind which meant employment and the destruction of which meant a great deal   of distress throughout the country.  But perhaps the most important consequence of such destruction has been the deprivation of an opportunity to earn wages. I have not any enumeration of cases. This again is a motion which came to us late, and there has been no time even to study the Resolution itself, or to adduce any detailed argument or instance where claims for loss could be brought forward. It should be clear to the Dail that if any person has suffered monetary loss through the destruction of a building, that building has to be rebuilt, and machinery to be provided to recompense the sufferer.  The men and women who have been deprived of employment, and therefore of their wages, are equally entitled to consideration and have a right to have their claims heard and compensation granted on an equitable basis with the owners of the property.  I therefore beg to move as an amendment, after the words &ldquo;July, 1921,&rdquo; to insert the following: &ldquo;or for loss of employment consequential upon such destruction or damage.&rdquo;  I do not suppose I could say any more to support this amendment, even if I were to talk for half an hour.  To me, at any rate, perhaps looking at this question through a particular glass, I can see no reason why anybody should oppose such an amendment, and in that faith I will move my amendment and ask somebody to second it. 
     
    
      
       I second the amendment. I would like to add that in Athlone there has been a printing works destroyed.  The employer has got his award for compensation, but the employees, who lost thirteen or fourteen weeks' wages, have received no communication of any description, nor have they got any allowance or any compensation for the time they lost.  I believe that the Government, about a year ago, asked those employees to send on certain forms, stating the amount they were at a loss, and that was to be forwarded to the Secretary of the County Council, who was to forward it on here, but this was nearly two years ago.  Those people have received no compensation.  I am speaking now of the time before the Truce. There has been a very great deal of loss to the workers throughout the country&mdash; for instance, to men working in firms where these firms are unable to send out their material, and those employees are at the present time working on half time. 
     
     
        That is owing to the critical state of the country.  I think it would be well that the Minister for Finance should take these things into account, because these people are suffering.  They are not suffering through being burned out, but nevertheless they are suffering extreme loss, and if it be possible that, when a firm is burned out, the owners receive compensation, I think it is only just that the employee should also receive compensation. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. 
    
      
       I would ask the Minister to consider the advisability of issuing instructions to any Commission that may sit that they will make a small advance of, say, 10 per cent. on claims to people who are about to build, or who want to build.  It is only this week that I met a trader who stated that if he even got 10 per cent., or had an assurance from the Ministry that he would get even 10 per cent. of his claim within a certain period, he would put in foundations with a view to rebuilding.  I understand there is no assurance given to any of these people that they will get the slightest assistance until this Commission has sent in its final decision.  I would ask the President and the Ministers to consider that point, and allow the owners of destroyed property to go on immediately with their rebuilding operations. Another point I would urge on the Government, or anyone who is likely to be on that Commission is this: you should put in a special clause that no owner of property shall get an award of any sort from the Government unless there is a definite guarantee to rebuild.  I was made aware quite recently that there is a case in the North of Ireland in which compensation was awarded to the extent of, I think, £20,000 for a mansion.  When the owner of the mansion got his £20,000 he put it in his pocket and crossed to England, and there is no possible chance of that mansion or the little industries around it that were destroyed ever being built again, because there was no condition put in when the award was made that he was to rebuild.  I hope the Government will take steps to see that no man will get an award for property destroyed unless he gives a definite assurance to rebuild. 
     
    
      
       I would like to support the amendment moved by Deputy   Johnson, and in doing so I wish to point out the hardship that is inflicted on the workers by the destruction of property since the Truce.  In most cases the destroyed property consists of mansions throughout the country, and really an extreme hardship has been imposed on the workers that have been thrown out of work as a direct result of this.  They are not even entitled to the unemployment dole.  I might mention that I have a case in my mind at the present moment.  I have one case in mind of a place burned down where there were 25 men thrown out of employment, and this case would not be outside the amendment we are discussing. The crops in that particular place are going to waste.  There are ten or twelve acres of potatoes, and the same acreage of oats and barley, that cannot be attended to and that are going to waste. I think that is one of the things that should be looked after.  The workers, since the Truce, deserve consideration, especially as most of these employees are men who have grown old in the employment of those whose houses have been burned down and they have no chance of getting other employment at the present time. 
     
    
      
       Legislation will have to be introduced, as I have already stated, with regard to this matter.  I am not personally disposed to agree with any extension of the principle that is laid down.  I am not in a position to assure the Dail that the country will be able to stand the enormous claims that are in hands for compensation by reason of this damage.  Now, this matter of unemployment was under consideration by us, and I was informed by people whom I consulted in the matter&mdash;I have not got the notes now&mdash;that there was a very considerable sum of money made available for unemployment.  I have already told the Dail we have made available for Local Authorities a sum of £275,000 early this year, and we have earmarked £100,000 for the relief of distress on the whole western seaboard. We put something like £1,000,000 in for housing.  We have an army of 30,000 and we are making up a Civic Guard of 3,000 or 4,000.  Compared with the order which is largely affected by this Resolution, I must say that the balance is in favour of the order represented by   the Deputies opposite.  We have claims in at the present moment&mdash;most extravagant claims&mdash;for every conceivable sort of loss.  We have claims for loss of business, for depreciation of shares as a result of what has happened, for dislocation of business, for business interruption, for money and jewellery from people who never possessed much money and who never sported such jewellery, and for consequential damages. There is an order not mentioned by anybody here who have stood, I think, very considerable loss during the last three or four or five years&mdash;that type of person who was &ldquo;on the run,&rdquo; and who certainly had to bear a good deal of expense by reason of that particular class of experiment&mdash;and then there is the loss suffered by farmers through losing markets, and so on.  Now, as regards the 10 per cent. that has been mentioned by the Deputy, I think some of those who are making claims would be very well paid if they got 10 per cent. of the claims that they have put in.  This does not refer to everybody. But I have seen some of the claims, and I am positively satisfied that if you said, &ldquo;Will you close for 10 per cent?&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;Oh, certainly, and at once, thank you.&rdquo;  That is the position we are in, with claims for over thirty millions.  If we open the door any wider I do not know what the sum is we would be in for.  There has been a general loss throughout the entire country. Each order has borne its share, and I would say that the order which has, perhaps, borne its share most patriotically is the order represented by the Deputies opposite.  I think they did it in a fine patriotic sense of their duty to the country, and I think they will benefit by the distribution of these awards when they are made, and that there will be, as result of the sacrifices they made, a greater security for their employment for the future.  But I think that if the terms be extended the country will not be able to bear it.  People are rather inclined to smile about the depreciation of shares; but that sort of thing does affect business, and business houses in making up their accounts, when they have to write down their reserves, or anything of that sort, owing to depreciation in shares, will seek to recoup their losses in some way or other by minimising their expenditure; and people opposite know what economy in that direction means. 
     
     
        It means cutting down the wages bill. I do not know that it would be possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy any such loss as has been mentioned by Deputy Johnson.  In cases where places have been closed people go away and get other employment.  That has not been always the case, but generally it is so.  If my recollection is correct, when Deputy Johnson appeared before the Dail last December, when the Treaty was under consideration, the number of unemployed at that time was in the neighbourhood of 100,000, and the figures reported to us last week here show a reduction of about 50 per cent. on that number. 
    
      
       For half the country. 
     
    
      
       . I do not know exactly what half is mentioned&mdash;whether it is the 26-32 or the 6-32. 
     
    
      
       100,000 was quoted for the whole country, and there are 47,000 still in the Northern half, or one-third, or whatever fraction you call it.  The number in the twenty-six counties is about the same&mdash;35,000 officially registered. 
     
    
      
       If that be so then I say we are showing some form in unemployment in the South; and the case would seem to be admitted by reason of that.  However, it comes to this, that whatever little charity I may have possessed has, I think, fled since I became Minister for Finance.  This is a matter in which I am out for getting in money, and I am very slow to put it out. Now, these are the circumstances of the case.  There is an expenditure of some £10,000,000 or £13,000,000 beyond the estimated receipts, and these estimated receipts are on the basis of a very honest type of citizen who has not shown himself up to this.  I hope we will be able to see him before the first of April with his full payment of Income Tax.  I ask the Deputies not to press this amendment. 
     
    
      
       I would point out that the Resolution as it stands means prejudicing the legislation which is referred to in the Resolution and limiting the direct authority.  If it is not that, if, in its wisdom&mdash;and I hope it will be wise enough&mdash;it includes in the enactment these people whom I am desirous of bringing in then the work that is going to   be begun now will have to be begun all over again.  It is said, of course, that the country cannot stand that. Then there will have to be pro rata deduction from those who have suffered from whatever cause and whatever kind of suffering or loss.  It is not germane to speak of the &ldquo;order&rdquo; of the working class. We are not asking for a contribution for the working class and the unemployed. That is not claimed at all.  We are asking that if a printer has been disemployed by virtue of the burning of a printing works, his claim for losses is just as good as the claim of the owner of that printing works, and to say that you have advanced money for housing and that you have advanced money for road-making, or for other things, does not affect that printer's loss, and unless under very extraordinary conditions you cannot get that printer to build a house, because he cannot do it. 
     
    
      
       He could occupy one. 
     
    
      
       Every conceivable claim, the Minister says, has been sent in for all kinds of losses, real and imaginary. They will have to be sifted.  Claims that would be sent in if this amendment passed would be very clear and easily tested, and if advantage has been taken of the moneys that have been expended, and if men have received other employment, then, of course, that would be taken into account in the fixing of compensation. There is no just reason for depriving the workman of compensation for loss of wages which does not apply equally to any of those other people who have put in claims, which are alleged to be exaggerated to the extent of 90 per cent. in many cases.  We are not asking in this case, as I have said, for a vote to meet general unemployment, and we have been told that the Government have no plans to deal with unemployment.  That is all the more reason why men who have lost their employment by virtue of destruction of the kind that is under consideration should have some title to compensation pro rata with the compensation that is allowed to the owner of the destroyed property.  The case seems to me to be a perfectly sound one and a perfectly logical one, and I would urge on the Minister to accept the amendment, so that in the preparation of cases for the tabulation, classifying, and registering of   such claims, claims for loss of wages should be taken into account and should receive at least equal attention from those responsible as claims for loss of property. 
     
    
      
       I do not know whether I am in order or not, or whether Deputy Johnson was in order in what he was stating&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       Deputy Johnson was scarcely strictly in order, but he proposed the amendment. 
     
    
      
       What I wish to say with regard to this case is that if you make the terms of reference as wide as Deputy Johnson has mentioned, it is meaningless.  You could not possibly do it.  If you confine cases of this sort to a particular set&mdash;take, for example, the printing works that Deputy Johnson has spoken of&mdash;and if by reason of the burning of that place these men lost their employment, and they did not afterwards get employment by reason of the place being destroyed, there might be something to be said for considering a claim of that sort; but I would remind Deputy Johnson that if the particular case he mentions is the Athlone Printing Works, my recollection is that it was burned by the Black and Tans. 
     
    
      
       I only gave an imaginary illustration. 
     
    
      
       A rather dangerous one.  That is one of the cases that is under the Lord Shaw Commission. 
     
    
      
       I did not mention Athlone. 
     
    
      
       I did.  I mentioned Athlone. 
     
    
      
       I think this case would come under the Commission.  I do not think you would get the Dail to adopt this amendment. 
     
    
      
       Chance that. 
     
    
      
       If you had any particular case, and if you had evidence to show that it should be included, that would be a different matter.  I am quite sure you would appreciate it if we were to be made responsible for loss of employment during the last three, four or five years, but the nation could not afford it. 
     
     
    
      
       May I explain that we are dealing with the Resolution and we are not touching four or five years. This is a specific period for special classes of property destroyed and damaged. I am prepared to add the words &ldquo;directly consequential upon such destruction,&rdquo; if the Minister would accept that. 
     
    
      
       It is rather too wide.  I am afraid I cannot accept anything so wide as that. 
     
    
      
       I may say that for myself I would be totally against accepting any such amendment.  We have to remember the implications of any such amendment.  If a workman is entitled to compensation because he is thrown out of employment by reason of the destruction of the particular works&mdash; the particular printing works, say&mdash;or any other works where he is usually employed, then surely there is no case for not giving an employer compensation for loss of profits. 
     
    
      
       That would depend on legislation. 
     
    
      
       If on the one side a worker is entitled to compensation for   his loss of employment, I want to know is there any case in life for refusing an owner of property, whose property has been destroyed, compensation for loss of profits?  I think that is a fair question. I think no just man will deny that when you once admit consequential damage on one side you must have consequential damage on the other.  We have still got loss of property in this country.  You have got to remember that.  If you admit consequential damage on one side and the other, what is the bill going to be like?  Will 100 millions cover it? And where will we get money for land purchase?  There are a lot of landless men in the country and they are all looking for farms.  Land purchase must be completed, but where is the money to come from?  After all, we are not children here.  We have got to make our arrangements&mdash;add and subtract, multiply and divide&mdash;and get the sum out right.  Where is all the money to come from?  Deputy Johnson stated at the beginning that this was a matter of faith rather than reason with him, and I think it is still the position.  There is no reason whatever, I urge.  It would be quite out of the question to entertain this amendment, and I appeal to the Dail to reject it. 
     
     
       
        Amendment put:&mdash;To insert after July, 1921, the words &ldquo;or for loss of employment consequential upon such destruction or damage.&rdquo; 
     The Dail divided: Ta, 13; Nil, 36.

       The President in opposing the amendment which was moved by Deputy Johnson stated that the benefit of the distribution of the grant would be derived in a fair share by the workers later on.  I think that the case such as that referred to by Deputy Alfred Byrne, of people who, when they get the amounts they have claimed, excessive or otherwise, are going to be allowed to clear out of this country, ought not to get money without some conditions being laid down whether they are going to rebuild or carry on their former business.  I think the workers are not going to get very much out of it so far as these cases are concerned.  It is rather unfortunate that in a good many cases in the country, large mansions have been destroyed&mdash; places where a good number of people have got employment.  The people who owned these mansions were, generally speaking, the remnants of England's loyal garrison in this country, who have cleared out to a more congenial home, and as far as I can gather, at least from newspaper comments, do not intend to return to this country.  I presume they will take whatever will be given by the Irish people so far as money is concerned, and they are not going to spend any part of that particular money in this country any more.  This is a result largely of that clearing out we hear of so much from the other side to-day about a proper settlement of the claims which have been made by that particular class.  Representations have been made to the Provisional Government, I understand, by the British Authorities to hurry or speed up the settlement of these claims.  That particular aspect of the matter is receiving attention as far as I can see in the political claims of the party in conflict in England at the approaching general election.  Now, I think if the British Government has any right to interfere with the Provisional Government in this particular aspect of this   business, which is the business of the Irish Government, we are equally entitled to ask the British Government, in reply, how they are dealing, or why it is they are not dealing in a proper way, with the legitimate claims of the Catholics of the Six Counties, that their forces were unable to protect.  I hope the aspects of the matter that have been raised by Deputy Byrne will receive the very careful consideration of the Government, that any claims made by people&mdash; big claims&mdash;in regard to the destruction of mansions and property within the Twenty-Six Counties will not be given without proper conditions being laid down, so that they will have to rebuild and carry on the work heretofore carried on by them. 
     
    
      
       In regard to the point raised by Deputy Davin, directly application was made to us in the first instance in respect of those refugees in England, we accepted liability, and we were entitled to accept liability, because we were discharging the functions of a Government and we accept liability for affording protection to all citizens.  And in the same letter in which we accepted that liability we made a claim for the people to whom, he has mentioned, Sir James Craig was not able to afford sufficient protection. 
     
     No time whatever was lost in regard to that.  I understand the number of refugees in England exceeds the number of refugees from the North, and, I believe, as in the case of refugees from all countries, that some of them are cases that are not strictly  bona fide , although I do not say that about the whole of them, as I have not seen the lists nor got any particulars about them. In so far as we are concerned for the Government of this country, we know no order in the community.  Every order in it has a right to protection and every order in it should get that protection, even though these people are the class or the order that Deputy Davin spoke of.  These people must get all the rights and privileges of citizenship in this country, and if they have been robbed, or deprived of their property, that property must be restored to them.  That is a moral obligation on our part, as well as a legal obligation.  We, on our part, will also claim for those citizens of Belfast or other places in the Six Counties who have been driven out.  The real   cause of complaint, I understand, is the slowness of the Shaw Commission.  There is a very large number of claims, and it would be, I think, impossible for that Commission, sitting continuously, to have dealt expeditiously with the cases.  We have, however, set up other machinery, and we are getting more rapidly through the cases.  The particular machinery we are setting up in this case will be much more extensive than that of the Shaw Commission. It will rather resemble extra machinery that has been brought into play in order to expedite the work of the Shaw Commission.  In the resolution that will be introduced all those matters that have been referred to by Deputy Davin can be safeguarded.  It is our intention to attach a building condition, where buildings have been destroyed. I think you will find that in the Bill when it comes before the Dail, and any other safeguards that are considered necessary may also be considered at that time, but I refrained in making my statement from going into any details, simply enabling the Government to get the claims tabulated and segregated, to see what class of machinery would be best adapted for dealing with them. Therefore, I recommend the Dail to pass the Resolution. 
     Motion put and carried. 
   
   
     ADJOURNMENT OF THE DAIL. 
    
      
       I propose that the Dail adjourn for one week.  We are still dealing with the question of compensation and many other questions that we find it very difficult to straighten out. I do not know that we would be in a position to put anything before the Dail for the next couple of days, so that I would ask an adjournment for a week. 
     
    
      
       I second the motion. 
     
    
      
       I think this is deserving of some protest.  I think the idea of being called together just for one day to deal with these two resolutions of the Ministry, and then adjourn for another week, is hardly fair to the Dail.  We understood there was likely to be a week's   adjournment required to prepare certain business, and we understood, too, that business would be ready for dealing with day by day from now forward.  Men have come up from the country.  Of course, they are in duty bound to do so, but it seems to be treating us rather with levity, asking us to come up for one half-day's business and then adjourn for another week, without having any indication of what the business is to be next week.  I would at least appeal to Ministers to give us some indication, three or four days before the resumption, as to what business will be brought forward, so that we would have an opportunity of considering the matter before it is placed on the Order Paper, and also give us some idea as to how long meetings will last after they are resumed. 
     
    
      
       I would prefer to adjourn for a fortnight, but I understood it was the wish of the Deputies opposite to meet once a week.  I would much prefer a fortnight's adjournment, as really one cannot get through much work in a week.  If Deputy Johnson wishes, I will extend my motion to a fortnight. 
     
    
      
       I shall not do anything of the kind.  We shall put down motions on our own account.  If we are not to be brought here for the sake of formally meeting, we will have to try and make business.  I understood the Dail was under the leadership of the President, and that he would see that the Dail was provided with business.  If we are not going to have that leadership, then we shall have to put forward our own propositions, and force discussions on all kinds of motions. 
     
    
      
       It is the business of an opposition to oppose and to a certain extent to criticise, but let us keep our eye on the fact that Parliament is for the country and for the doing of the business of the country, and that there is no intrinsic virtue in coming here and talking.  It is the doing of the business that counts and in times like the present it is and must be a question of having a sense of proportion, and we ought to be the best judges as to whether we are doing the urgent and vital work of the country, whether it be here or in the supervision of our departments, or in the supervision of the one hundred or   the one thousand different important things that require to be done and done urgently.  We called this meeting because we considered that it was necessary to have these resolutions passed to-day by the Parliament, but the work of administration is at the moment more important than the work of discussion here, and we should get an opportunity of doing that work.  Some of us are at the heads of Departments that were not taken over from the British.  There were no corresponding Departments here before, and those Departments at the moment have to be built up, consolidated and put on their way, and we cannot do that if we are to come here day after day and listen to a certain amount of rhetoric. 
     
    
      
       The President stated that the fact was that the Dail should be adjourned for a fortnight.  I have conferred with some of my colleages and it seems to me and to them that it would be better to adjourn for a fortnight rather than meet again next week and sit for one day.  I suggest to the President if it would be of any advantage to the Ministry&mdash;and we understand how pressed they are for time for going into all the questions that must be met&mdash;that they adopt the idea. 
     
    
      
       We cannot agree to the suggestion that has been made that the Dail should adjourn.  We cannot regard as at all satisfactory the statement made by the Minister for Home Affairs, because every argument he put forward would justify the adjournment of the Dail for an indefinite period. What we want to ask is this, is there no urgent business that requires to be done?  What about the Electoral Bill? And again, will some representative of the Ministry tell us what is the programme for the next two or three weeks?  What are the subjects?  In what order will those subjects be taken, and when will they be brought up? Surely we are entitled to ask that. 
     
    
      
       The motion is to adjourn for a week. 
     
    
      
       In reply to a point raised by Deputy O'Brien, the most urgent business that lies before this Dail is business in the nature of legislation, and that business cannot be undertaken   until the Constitution comes into operation, so that all the business this Dail will have to do&mdash;the real, urgent part&mdash; must be postponed until the Constitution comes into operation.  We are at work at the moment on an Electoral Bill.  It is not in a condition that it can be brought before the Dail, although the first draft is made, and the Dail will not be in a position to consider it at the moment; the Dail can really only do a limited range of business.  It can only do such things as it can do by resolution, and resolutions dealing with many of the matters that people would like to deal with would not be effective.  Resolutions that will be effective are those of the nature that have something to do with the domestic politics of the Dail.  Anything of that kind can be dealt with by resolution, but things requiring legislative changes cannot be.  Authorisations can be given to the Ministers, if necessary, in a large number of legislative changes, but the fact is that the most important section of the business of the Parliament&mdash;legislation&mdash;is held up at the moment.  There is a good argument against postponement. Matters of urgent public importance may arise, and it is not desirable that the Dail should be postponed.  Then there is a possibility that some criticism may be required. There is a possibility that someone may want to question Ministers with regard to the administration of their Departments. It is not desirable that Deputies should be deprived of that privilege. On the other hand, it is rather in the nature of a waste of time to have a general discussion, because these resolutions have not actual effect in the way of having a compelling effect of any sort, and it would not be desirable to have the Dail discussing at length all sorts of matters and resolutions which it might ignore afterwards if it came to pass the resolution. 
     
    
      
       In view of the pronouncement made by the Ministry, if they cannot give a guarantee that the Dail will sit all next week there is no use coming up here.  It is all very well for men from the city, but to come up from the country is a different matter. If you are going to meet only for a day next week, I suggest you adjourn for a fortnight.  There are no trains running from some parts of the country and it is no pleasure to come up here at all.  It is   hard work.  I suggest that the Dail should adjourn for a fortnight. 
     
    
      
       I support that because it gives the Deputies an excellent opportunity during the recess to denounce the Government for neglect of their duties.  Now, if we have no definite business to transact, why should we assemble?  If we are going to see some effort being made to make business, well, I think it is simply make-believe.  We are simply then a debating society, and we are lowering the status of the Dail, so I think there is a great deal to be said from the point of view of the Ministry. They are engaged in a task of tremendous difficulty in building up their Departmental work, and every man knows, who has private business to attend to, what a day off means, and when the Ministers are dealing with matters vital to the Nation's life you can realise what a tremendous thing it is by listening to what the Minister for Home Affairs has said.  I think if the Ministry has no real business this day week it should consider an adjournment for a fortnight.  If Deputy Johnson has got something for this day week, he will be able to get twice as much for this day fortnight. 
     
    
      
       I may say that we do not accept the position put forward that this Parliament cannot enact any legislation.  There is no reason why important measures should not be advanced.  We do not accept the position that has been put forward.  I believe we have a resolution of the Dail to that effect.  Now, as to the question of business, if the Government has no business to put forward, or, as Deputy Milroy described it, no real business, I can promise that from these benches we will put forward practical proposals and items of real business if we get an opportunity of carrying them through.  If the Government has nothing to put forward then we will have something, and it will not be for the sake of talking that we will put those things forward.  Then there are questions of criticism&mdash;useful criticism of Departmental work.  It is very necessary and useful to my mind that we should have an opportunity, by questioning, of criticising work of various departments and finding out what is being done.  I am totally opposed to the proposal that we   should have an adjournment for a fortnight, or even for a week. 
     
    
      
       I am surprised at the speech of Deputy O'Connell. Usually he is fairly sensible, if he will accept the compliment from me.  When he says that they do not accept the position that this Constituent Assembly cannot legislate, I am naturally surprised. I thought we had accepted the Treaty and that we passed a Constitution, and I thought there was certain machinery in that Constitution for pasing legislation.  I think it is a fact that that machinery is not yet brought into being.  Yet, Deputy O'Connell gets up and suggests that we can start legislation straight away. 
     
    
      
       May I suggest that the Minister would read the Order in Council? 
     
    
      
       What is the point the Deputy is making?  I am pointing out that there is a practical difficulty.  We accepted the Treaty, we passed the Constitution, we laid down certain machinery for passing legislation.  That machinery is not in operation, and yet we are told we can use machinery although it is not in operation.  We are forced into a most extraordinary position here.  It would appear as if we had nothing else to do, and that we are burning to have a meeting of Parliament; that we are endeavouring to get a meeting, let us say, next week, because we have nothing else to do.  If the Parliament did not meet for the next two months we could be working twelve hours a day, and we might not have our tasks finished.  We are in no hurry about a meeting of Parliament.  We regard the work which we have to do in our offices&mdash; work in connection with the taking over of services of the country from the English&mdash;as more important than any discussions which cannot lead to anything until the machinery for legislation is completed.  I think that is a perfectly understandable position.  We are not exactly in normal times.  Even if things were perfectly normal Parliament would adjourn for a certain time.  In addition to all the work which we have to do as heads of departments, we have all the work which is necessary in order to get over essential services from the English, to scheme departments, and to do a thousand and one things so as to bring the Treaty into operation.  I would   certainly be in favour of adjourning for a fortnight. 
     
    
      
       I rise to support the proposal to adjourn for a fortnight, when we have no real business to do. Before the motion is put I would like, on a matter of information, to ask the Ministry whether they have made any progress in the formation of the two Commissions that were promised.  The Commissions I refer to are the Cost of Food Commission and the Electoral Abuses Commission.  Have those Commissions been formed, or has any progress been made in connection with their formation? 
     
    
      
       With regard to the Electoral Abuses Commission, I have already asked some people to act.  I am asking a few others to-day or to-morrow. I would say that the membership of the Commission will be complete within a few days.  I have already arranged for the Secretarial side of the work. 
     
    
      
       From a democratic standpoint I would say that the different sections of the Dail ought to have an opportunity to put their own people on these Commissions, and not have anybody going around asking them.  I do not like that.  For instance, the Labour Party ought to have the selection of their own representatives, and we of the Farmers' Party insist on the right to have the selection of our own representative. 
     
    
      
       There is a Commission in connection with the dismissed and resigned policemen&mdash;that is, policemen who were dismissed or who resigned between January 1919 and the Truce.  I am setting up such a Commission, and I think it right that the Dail should know the proposed constitution of it.  There will be two representatives of the ex-policemen; there will be one representative of the Home Affairs Department; one representative of the Finance Department; and one representative of the Army.  In addition there will be the Chairman, as to whom we have not yet finally decided, but who, I think, will be acceptable. 
     
    
      
       Any representative of the Dail? 
     
    
      
       No; it is a kind of Departmental Committee rather than a Parliamentary Commission.  Its report will be made available for the Dail and for discussion, if necessary. 
     
     
    
      
       The motion before the Dail is that we adjourn for a week. 
     
    
      
       I beg to propose as an amendment that the Dail adjourns for a fortnight, and I do that so as to put the matter in order. 
     
    
      
       I second that amendment. 
     
    
      
       I will accept the amendment.  I think that the Deputies opposite slightly misunderstand what the position is.  We had certainly two Departments not constructed until practically the Dail had met; these are the Home Affairs and Finance Departments. There were reasons in each case why much work had not been done during the six months up to the end of June, and there was a reason why nothing was done from the 28th June until the 9th September.  With regard to the Finance Department, we have the service, that is to say we have the money, but we have not got the officials.  The arrangement of Departments such as those is a matter which takes a very considerable length of time.  It means many journeys to and from London by our officials.  It means the setting up of machinery such as we have not had, and of which we have had no experience in this country. With regard to the other Department, the Deputies opposite know by reason of the amount of work done and the proposals brought forward before the Dail, that that Department is showing remarkable signs of expansion and is restoring order and normal conditions throughout the country.  There is another Department which has not come over as far as its service is concerned or in regard to its personnel. Steps have to be taken and visits have been made to London for the scheming of that Department.  Those are matters which one cannot do within a few days.  There is another matter which I expect to be able to bring up before the Dail in a fortnight's time, and that is the Estimates.  We have not got the details in print.  We have them in figures, but they are not yet printed, and they will take careful consideration before they are presented to the Dail in proper order. It does not mean that because we have no business ready that we are bankrupt of any business.  I think that the Deputies may be satisfied that as far as   human ingenuity, physique and resources can go we are delivering here to the Dail as much business as can be reasonably expected and that there is no slacking going on that I or that any of the Ministers know of.  A reasonable delay is rendered necessary in the abnormal circumstances of the time; and the the abnormal sort of administration that we have had to construct as well as to administer. 
     
    
      
       This motion for an adjournment for a fortnight might as well be followed by a motion for an adjournment indefinitely, until Ministers think that they ought to bring matters before the Dail.  One would imagine that there had been no discussion at an earlier part of this session on the powers of this Dail.  The Minister for Agriculture simply talks to us as though the question of the power of this Dail to legislate had not been decided by the Dail.  It was decided with the approval of the Ministry that the powers of the Dail are equal to the powers of the Parliament under the Treaty.  Now, the Minister denies that we have that power to legislate. 
     
    
      
       Not at all. 
     
    
      
       Well, then, we have power to legislate.  We have power to enact legislation for the twenty-six Counties. The Minister shakes his head and says we have not.  Where are we?  The Dail decided that we had power, and we have been hoping that the Dail would exercise that right.  The trouble seems to me to be that we are still being treated as a body of people to whom the Ministry may come when they wish to have certain decisions ratified, not as a legislative assembly at all.  One would think that there was no legislation required in the country, that everything was brought up to date and that you might adjourn for a week or a fortnight or a month or six months, because everything was perfect.  I do not think the country believes that.  At least since January Ministers have had the reins of power in their hands, and they have not been subject to the criticism that they might have been subject to from the Dail.  We had a right to expect that they had proposals for legislation in a fairly advanced form when the Dail met in September.  But now it is suggested that we should adjourn for a fortnight.  I am sure that if   somebody said a month, the majority of the Dail would agree to it.  That is the feeling.  We have very serious administrative matters to be brought forward. The country is not satisfied with the administration, and the country is not satisfied with the conduct of the prisons, and the country is not satisfied with the conduct of the military forces, nor with the conduct of many things, and it is necessary that these should be brought under review.  And we have been hoping that the initiative would come in many of these matters from the Ministerial benches.  It seems that we are forced to take an attitude that we have no desire to take, and to become definitely and obstinately an Opposition.  I do not know whether the Ministers intend that, or want to challenge us to take that position.  But it seems to me that that is the implication of their present attitude.  We are told now that there is nothing to be done because we have nothing ready, and that they must get on with the administrative work, which means, of course, that Ministers, whom nobody denies are working very hard, are working as heads of Departments and not as Ministers.  Consequently they had not the time to deal with legislative matters.  I feel that in this matter the Dail is anxious to get away from any responsibility.  We have seen for the last two months that, so far as any critical faculty is concerned, at any rate it has been left to a comparatively small number, and the majority of the Dail want to get away and leave matters in the hands of Ministers, and let them do what they like, and report to the Dail when they like what has been done. That is not a satisfactory state of things, and I am personally certain the country generally will resent it. 
     
    
      
       I would like to make the position clear.  The Dail has power to legislate, and a full meeting of the Dail can be called.  At the present moment you can repudiate the Treaty if you are prepared to take the consequences. It is merely a question of consequences.  As long as the Dail accepts the Treaty it accepts the machinery set up by the Treaty. 
     
    
      
       Read the Agreement Act. 
     
    
      
       As long as the Dail accepts the Treaty, and the Constitution,   it must accept the machinery set up by both.  Deputy Johnson spoke of adjourning for a month, and the Dail, he said, would be quite satisfied to do so; I think the country would like to see the Dail adjourning for a month.  What the country would like is for the Dail to adjourn and give the Government a free hand for restoring order.  That is what the country wants, and I stand for that. However, in order to meet Deputy Johnson and the other Deputies who think that they should have recurring chances of criticising the Government&mdash;and they are perfectly entitled to think that&mdash;we are quite willing to accept the Amendment that the Dail should adjourn for fortnight. 
     
    
      
       It is perhaps time once for all, that we should have done with this question of the powers of the Dail to legislate and about that resolution that was passed.  The resolution was proposed by Deputy Johnson in the first instance, because he had not taken the trouble to read the Free State Agreement Act, or if he did read it, he did not read it with any care, and did not take the trouble to see what it means. In the Free State Agreement Act it is laid down that the people elected for constituencies in the Twenty-Six Counties shall constitute the House of the Parliament to which the Provisional Government is responsible.  It does not say that that House of the Parliament shall have power to legislate.  It says that &ldquo;Parliament shall have power to legislate&rdquo;&mdash;that means, that there is a question involved of the Royal Assent. There is no power in this Dail to legislate without the Royal Assent; so far as the Free State Agreement Act goes, that is the only power it has, unless it chooses to exercise the inherent, inalienable and indefeasible power it has to repudiate the Treaty.  There is no power unless we choose now to have this Royal Assent given, other than the manner that we laid down in our own Constitution, and we are not prepared to do that.  And consequently for all practical purposes the Dail had not the power. 
     
    
      
       Now we have got the real reason, for the first time. 
     
    
      
       Absolutely clear for anybody who likes to read it. 
     
     
    
      
       I have heard Deputies here talk about what the country wants. Now, I come from the country.  I have been in touch with the people of the country, and a great deal of them want work, and they do not want this gabbling and hot air that used to obtain in the late Dail and a considerable amount of it in this Dail.  Gentlemen think they cut a very pretty figure in the Press in the discussions here.  They do not; and the people do not care two pins about them.  They want less talk and want you to get on with the work.  Deputy Johnson may think that he is a very able man, but the people do not think so.  A lot of the stuff here is gas and hot air. 
     
     
    
      
       I intended to move an amendment before Deputy Johnson spoke, and it is that this Dail should adjourn for a month in order to give Ministers plenty of opportunity of getting everything over from the British Empire to Ireland; but there is another matter also.  If we adjourn for a month it will give this Dail four days' work to do. We will continue to Friday, and by that time the Ministers and the Deputies may have made up their minds that we should continue, or that we adjourn until the 6th of December, when we will have proper legal authority and not be a debating society, as has been stated.  I therefore propose that this Dail do adjourn for a month. 
       Amendment put:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dail do adjourn for a fortnight.&rdquo; 
       The Dail divided: Ta, 34; Nil, 14.

     Amendment, put as a substantive motion. 
     Agreed. 
     The Dail adjourned at 6.20. 
   
   
     [WRITTEN REPLIES.] - POSSESSION OF MOTOR CAR. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether it is a fact that the National forces at Roscommon hold a Chevrolet car the property of Joseph O'Dea, of Lake View House, Glenamaddy; whether the car has been in the possession of the military for over four months; whether the owner, who carries on a motor hiring business, has, in consequence, suffered considerable loss; and whether he will give instructions to have this car restored at once. Further, if he will say whether Mr. O'Dea will be compensated for loss of business due to the withholding of the car, and for cost of repairs consequent on its use meantime by the military.  Also, if he will inquire whether a sum of £16, due to Mr. O'Dea by the Army authorities, and for which application has been made on several occasions, has yet been paid him, and, if not, will he see that the matter gets immediate attention. 
     
    
      
       The car, which was requisitioned about four months ago, is at present in Mullingar Barracks in a damaged condition.  The questions of its return and of compensation for damage done and for the use of the car are at the moment under consideration.  I have no knowledge of the precise sum of £16 said to be due to Mr. O'Dea. 
     
   
   
     [WRITTEN REPLIES.] - COACHFORD (CO. CORK) INQUEST. 
     
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that at an inquest held by Coroner J.J. Horgan, at Mr. Gilligan's house, Coachford, Co. Cork, on Monday, 11th September, 1922, into the circumstances of the death of Timothy Kenefick, the verdict was: &ldquo;Wilful murder of Timothy Kenefich by National troops at Nadrid, Coachford, Co. Cork, on 8th September, 1922,&rdquo; and whether any attempts have been made to bring the guilty one's to justice; and whether any compensation will be given to the widow of the deceased. 
     
    
      
       I have ascertained that the inquest was held under the auspices of Irregulars armed to the teeth, and before a jury that was apparently selected by Irregulars.  The Coroner, in directing the jury, pointed out that they had heard only one side of the case.  This was inevitable under the conditions.  An adjournment was suggested, but not agreed to.  Under the circumstances no action has been taken to bring the so-called guilty troops to justice, and the question of compensation for the widow of Kenefick is not a matter for the Defence Department. 
     
   
   
     [WRITTEN REPLIES.] - ORIEL HOUSE EXPLOSION. 
    
      
       I wish to ask the President the question of which I have given him private notice. 
     
    
      
       According to the Standing Orders the Chairman should receive notice of a question which is to be asked under such circumstances. I have not received a copy of the question, and I am, therefore, not in a position to say whether the question can be asked. 
     
    
      
       I would like to explain that I handed in this question yesterday, and was advised to pass it on to the President. 
     
     
    
      
       If the President is desirous, he may take it up. 
     
    
      
       The question is:&mdash;&ldquo;To ask the President of the Ministry if he will appoint a special Commission of Inquiry into the smuggling of mines into Oriel House for the purpose of the explosion there on the night of Monday, October 30th, and if in view of similar occurrences before, he will cause such Commission to extend its enquiries into the general question of the discipline of the armed forces of the State?&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       Oriel House is under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Home Affairs, and so, I think, the Minister for Home Affairs would be best qualified to answer the question.  As regards the question of a Commission, I do not know that any useful purpose is served by appointing a Commission on a matter of that sort.  It is a military question, and one would have to employ military to deal with it.  I presume that a question of that kind will be dealt with by the Minister himself. 
     
    
      
       There were no mines smuggled into Oriel House.  A reconstruction of this particular crime seems to be that a grating in the footpath was prised up and planks were put down at an angle, and the mines were slid down the planks.  Only one of four mines exploded.  If the four mines had exploded it is safe to say there would have been very considerable damage to property and immense loss of life in that area.  We are satisfied that it is not an occasion for a Commission or Committee of any kind, and that the official resources at the disposal of the Government are sufficient to deal with the matter.  I have reports from Oriel House and the D.M.P. and the military, which I think it is unnecessary to read to the House, but which I could send to the Deputy if he so desires.
