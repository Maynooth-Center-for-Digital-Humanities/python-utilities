     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - FARMERS AND INCOME TAX. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister of Finance if he will consider:&mdash; 
       (1)  Permitting the Income Tax of persons engaged in Agriculture, whether under Schedule A or under Schedule B, or both, for the years 1919/20, 1920/21, 1921/22, to be adjusted together, so that losses may be set off against profits. 
       (2)  Whether he will suspend the time limit for lodging Farm Income Tax appeals. 
       (3)  Further, to ask whether he will return as soon as may be to the prewar assessment of Income Tax under Schedule B, to one-third of the rateable valuation. 
     
    
      
       (1)  Where a loss in husbandry is proved for any year, full allowance for that loss can be made against any other liability for the same year.  The suggestion that a loss in farming for any year should be set off against assessable liability for another year is one which it would be impossible to reconcile with the Income Tax law. 
       (2) Where reasonable cause is shown it is not the practice in present circumstances to refuse an appeal on the score of time limit.  If the Deputy can let me have particulars of any specific cases in which it is claimed that reasonable latitude has not been allowed, I will have inquiries made. 
     
     (3) As stated in my reply to Deputy Runaid on 20th instant, the basis of assessment for 1922/23 has already been   reduced by one-half.  The question as to whether or not a further reduction can be made for 1923/24 will be a matter for the decision of this House next year. 
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - DUBLIN PORT IMPROVEMENTS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Finance if an amended application has been received from the Dublin Port and Docks Board for a grant to carry on their Improvement Works and continue the employment of three hundred men, at present under a threat of dismissal, and, if so, whether he will state the result of the Board's application. 
     
    
      
       A Deputation from the Dublin Port and Docks Board waited on me this morning, when suggestions for enabling these works to be continued were discussed.  The Board is to consider the matter further, and I will await a communication from it. 
     
    
      
       May I ask if there was any guarantee given that in the meantime these three hundred men would not be dismissed? 
     
    
      
       I do not think so.  That question did not arise during the interview. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - INCOME TAX ON COTTAGES. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that demands for Income Tax have been received by Rural District Councils in respect of cottages erected under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, and in view of the fact that in practically all these schemes the Revenue derived from rents is not sufficient to meet the repayment of loans and other current expenses, but requires a subsidy from local rates, he would state whether such demands for Income Tax are properly payable by District Councils. 
     
    
      
       Demands for Income Tax are made on the ground that the net liability for Income Tax is based on the valuation of the cottages. A deduction is allowable in respect of the amount of interest included annually in the repayments by District Councils. This allowance can be obtained on due proof as to the amount of interest being furnished to the Inspector of Taxes.  No   allowance can be made in respect of repayments of loans or other current expenses. Subject to the deductions referred to above the demands for Income Tax are properly payable. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - REBUILDING OF CORK. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a number of firms in Cork City to whom awards have been made, and compensation claims paid, have, although approached on several occasions by representatives of the Cork Corporation and the Cork Workers' Council, persistently refused to start the rebuilding of the destroyed premises, and whether, in view of the widespread unemployment presently existing in Cork City, he will take steps to compel the firms who have received compensation to start the rebuilding immediately. 
     
    
      
       I understand that pressure has been put locally on firms in Cork who expect to have claims for compensation paid in order to secure that such firms should commence rebuilding at once.  The number of firms, however, in whose case awards have in fact been made and compensation actually paid is hitherto small, though it is anticipated that it will greatly increase in the near future.  The arrangement made in Cork that firms wishing to rebuild could obtain advances up to 3/5ths of the amount of the building decree held by them has not been availed of to the extent expected, but I understand that the firms concerned were not anxious to commit themselves until the precise sum payable to them was ascertained.  The present cost of building in Cork is not such as to encourage the prompt placing of contracts and it would appear to be a matter of importance for the City that all parties should consult together with a view to such a reduction in costs as will enable the money available for rebuilding to be applied to the best advantage. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - VICTIMISED CIVIL SERVANTS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Finance: 
     
     (1)  If it is not a fact that a large percentage of Civil Servants, victimised for political reasons immediately prior to and after Easter, 1916, have not yet   been reinstated as a preliminary to the full consideration of their cases: 
     (2)  When the Tribunal which is being set up by the Government to investigate the claims of the victimised Civil Servants will commence its deliberations: 
     (3)  What will be its terms of reference and its personnel, and 
     (4)  What representation it is proposed to give thereon to the Association of Victimised Civil Servants. 
    
      
       In every case of victimisation of whole-time Civil Servants in Irish Departments, in which the fact of victimisation was clearly established, the Government has reinstated the victimised officer.  Some 70 reinstatements have thus been carried out.  A number of further cases in which it was necessary to make some additional inquiries, or in which the applications were received at a late date, have now been disposed of and instructions for reinstatement have been issued.  In cases in which the fact of victimisation has not been clearly established it is proposed to set up a Committee to consider the merits of each case.  This Committee will also deal with certain cases of alleged victimisation outside Ireland and certain exceptional cases in the Post Office.  I am not yet in a position to make an announcement as to the Terms of Reference and Constitution of this Committee. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - OLD AGE PENSIONS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government if he can give reasons for the disallowance of Old Age Pensions in regard to:&mdash; 
       James Cumesky, Kill, Kilnalick, Co. Cavan; 
       Edward Reynolds, Kill, Kilnalick, Co. Cavan; 
       James Hanlon, Carramore, Ballyconnell, Co. Cavan; 
       particulars of which cases have been supplied to him. 
     
    
      
       In all three cases the claims to Old Age Pensions were disallowed on ground of age. No evidence as to age was submitted beyond Declarations by aged persons of their belief that the claimants had attained the age of 70 years.  Such information   is helpful in conjunction with other evidence as to a claimant's age, but it will be obvious that the evidence of people who in many cases must be suffering from senility cannot be accepted as conclusive.  In the case of James Hanlon, the evidence afforded by the Declaration was discounted by the records of the Marriage Register which showed that he was married on the 23rd May, 1894, and was at that time 38 years of age. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - RATES ON NEW HOUSES. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government if he will consider the question of introducing legislation to exempt from taxation and rates for ten years all new houses that may be built by private builders, within the next two years; or if he will make a grant to builders towards the erection of houses for citizens of Dublin now in urgent need of proper housing accommodation; further, if he is aware that there is an immediate demand for 20,000 houses in the City of Dublin and that the only effort being made to meet that demand is 500 houses per year being built by the Dublin Corporation; also if he is aware that many private builders are anxious to build if assistance is granted. 
     
    
      
       The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative, and the proposal will not be considered unless it becomes evident that local authorities advocate a policy of remitting rates in such cases.  The need of Dublin for new houses is fully recognised. The Corporation have at present in various stages schemes involving the erection of 2,000 new houses and the work is being pushed forward as expeditiously as possible.  The number of houses erected in Dublin by other agencies with State aid has been relatively small compared with the activities of private builders in other towns.  The question of continuing grants to private builders for a further limited time will be considered. 
     
    
      
       May I ask if the Minister is aware that the first half of the question is looked upon with favour by the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation, and that it is only a matter of legislation to give private individuals the same concessions as private utility societies.  May I say that any   six individuals can form a public utility society and can get these concessions? 
       No reply was given. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government whether any, and if so, how much money has been granted to the Galway Co. Council for the relief of unemployment; what amount of any such grant has been expended in the county, and whether in view of the very great distress which exists, especially in the western portion of the county, he will consider the advisability of taking measures to have works of public utility carried out by the County Council or other recognised authority and to have special grants made available for such purposes. 
     
    
      
       Of the special grant of £275,000 for relief of unemployment the share of Co. Galway, £14,666 13s. 4d., was paid to the Co. Council and has been expended in the county on foot of approved schemes.  Of the special grant of £100,000 voted by the Dail for the relief of distress the sum of £15,000 was allocated to County Galway as follows:&mdash; 
     
     
       
         
         
         
         
         
           
             Clifden R.D.C 
             £4,000 
           
           
             Oughterard R.D.C. 
             4,400 
           
           
             Galway R.D.C. (Arran Isles £1,000) 
             4,000 
           
           
             Gort (Kinvara area) 
             1,100 
           
           
             Galway Urban District 
             1,500 
           
         
       
     
     The scheme for the expenditure of the grant in Galway Urban District has been approved and the amount disbursed.  In the other cases the due distribution of the money on approved schemes has not been possible owing to local conditions and to the destruction of roads and bridges. 
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - HOUSING ACCOMMODATION. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware of the urgent necessity existing in rural districts for extra housing accommodation and if he could state when the instructions for the guidance of Rural District Councils would be issued by his Department both in respect of schemes under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts for which loans had been sanctioned and which have not yet been completed, and in respect of new schemes now being formulated. 
     
     
    
      
       This question was dealt with fully in my reply to Sean O Laidhin on the 13th instant, and there is nothing to add on the subject. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - DISTRESS IN CONNEMARA. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the great distress which exists in the connemara area due largely to the closing down of the railway line from Galway to Clifden, whether such distress will not be accentuated during the winter months because of the impracticability of carrying on even the limited coastwise communications now available, and whether, in view of this, he will get into communication with the Midland Great Western Railway and urge the Company to re-open this line to general traffic. Further, if he will state the reasons for the closing of the Marconi Wireless Station of Clifden (which had been opened since the middle of August) with the consequent disemployment of a large number of workers, and if he will use his best endeavours to have the station re-opened. 
     
    
      
       The Midland Great Western Railway Company is prepared to re-open the line from Galway to Clifden as soon as the Military Authorities are in a position to allow the necessary repairs to be executed. It is expected that the repairs will not take long to complete and that the Company can be authorised to proceed with them at an early date.  The Postmaster-General will reply to the second part of the question. 
     
    
      
       The Clifden Wireless Station, which is owned by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, was extensively damaged by Irregulars a few months ago.  Besides, the land lines serving the Station were maliciously cut down.  I am having enquiry made of the Company as to the prospects of re-opening. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - TEACHERS' SUBSTITUTES DURING WAR PERIOD. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Education whether he is aware that teachers who served as substitutes for teachers who joined the British military forces during the period   of the European War have not had such service reckoned for purposes of increment, and whether he will take steps to have this matter rectified; further, if he will state the number of national teachers now in the service of the Ministry who acted as such substitutes. 
     
    
      
       The British Treasury refused to recognise for the purpose of increments, pension, etc., service rendered as substitute for a teacher on Military Service, except in the case of substitutes ineligible for Military Service.  The number of teachers adversely affected by this regulation is 28.  Their position has already been considered, and it has been decided (September 8th) to grant all teachers who acted as substitutes during the period in question the recognition then accorded to teachers unfit for Military Service, subject to the condition that the Ministry accepts no financial liability in this matter for the period prior to April 1st, 1922. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - CORK SCHOOL ATTENDANCE COURTS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Education if he has received a resolution from Cork School Attendance Committee relative to the re-establishing of School Attendance Courts to deal with infringements of the Compulsory Attendance Act, and what action, if any, he has taken, or intends to take, in the matter. 
     
    
      
       The resolution from the Cork School Attendance Committee has been duly received. Excellent work has been done in Cork in the matter of enforcing school attendance. It is hoped to have this good work continued and extended when the Courts of Summary Jurisdiction now being set up are established and certain necessary amendments are made in the Education Act of 1892.  I may add that every well-considered activity that tends to develop the immediate interest and responsibility of the citizens in the education of their children is deserving of the highest consideration. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - CASH ON DELIVERY SYSTEM. 
    
      
       To ask the Postmaster-General whether it is a fact that the system known as the &ldquo;Cash on   Delivery,&rdquo; whereby parcels are delivered by the Post Office and the cost collected from the addressee and transmitted to the sender, is working satisfactorily in the United States, France, Switzerland, and other countries: whether the introduction of this system would not tend to stimulate business in this country, and whether the Postmaster-General contemplates its early establishment? 
     
    
      
       I am aware that a Cash on Delivery service is in operation in the United States and many Continental States, but I have no information at present as to the results of its working in these places, nor whether the service is remunerative. The system is already in force between this country and some States in Europe as well as certain British Colonies.  I am considering whether the establishment of an Inland Cash on Delivery service would be advantageous, having regard to the circumstances of the country and to the wishes and requirements of the business interests and of the public.  The matter is one which will require close consideration. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - PAYMENT OF IRISH TEACHERS IN COUNTY WICKLOW. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction have refused to contribute their part of the necessary funds to the County Wicklow Technical Instruction Committee for the payment of the six whole-time Irish Teachers appointed by this body, notwithstanding the fact that the County Council and the Arklow and Wicklow Urban Councils have in each case carried out their undertakings and have raised the rate for the teaching of the National Language. Is he aware this Department, functioning under the British Government, had paid a bonus of £35 and a third per cent. additional remuneration during the past three sessions to part-time teachers of Irish under the County Wicklow Technical Instruction, and why are these teachers treated in a different manner under an Irish Government? 
     
    
      
       The Department's contributions to the scheme of Technical Instruction in County Wicklow this session will be on the same basis as for   last session.  The position is that as a result of increased contributions to the Scheme from local Councils, the committee are proposing to appoint six whole-time and fifteen part-time teachers of Irish, and they have asked the Department to provide the cost of living bonus to the whole-time teachers, and the temporary additional remuneration of 33? per cent., referred to in the question, to the part-time teachers.  This proposal would raise the charge on the Department's funds from £700 paid for last session to £1,450.  As, however, the Department's estimates for the current financial year were prepared before the appointments of the additional teachers now to be engaged were proposed, no provision was made for bonus to the six whole-time teachers, or for temporary additional remuneration to the new part-time teachers to be employed this session.  No increase can now be made in the estimates, and the Department are not, therefore, in a position to undertake any further commitments.  Last session five part-time teachers of Irish were engaged, and as the estimates made provision for the continued employment of that number this year, temporary additional remuneration will be paid by the Department in these five cases, which will be treated in the same manner as in previous sessions. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - DIVIDING UP OF RANCHES. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Agriculture, if pending the introduction of legislation dealing with the land problem, he can advise and assist in the dividing up of farms and ranches put up for sale at public auction, when the landlords or executors of such farms or ranches are willing and are in favour of the dividing up such lands amongst the landless men and uneconomic holders, and, whether he can give any intimation that such cases will be dealt with early in the next Session. 
     
    
      
       The introduction and financing of Land Purchase schemes is bound up with the problem of the financial settlement between Ireland and England.  Negotiations on this are going on at present and will be continued after the Constitution is passed. It will, however, take some months before arrangements are completed.  In the meantime the Land Settlement Commission which is now functioning   under the Provisional Government, is being kept intact as an Arbitration Court and where landlords or owners of land consent there will be no difficulty in making this Arbitration Court available either to fix prices or where new judicial tenancies are being created or to carry out the actual division of the land. Until, however, land purchase legislation is introduced, such sales cannot be financed by the State. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - COLLEGE OF SCIENCE BUILDINGS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Agriculture whether it is a fact that alterations are in progress or in contemplation in the buildings hitherto occupied by the College of Science, which will, if carried out, make it impracticable for the college to resume its normal activities in its former home on the termination of the present military emergency.  The Minister read his reply to this question last week, and I am satisfied with the reply he gave then, unless he can add something to it. 
     
    
      
       I do not think I can add anything to it. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - A GLASTHULE PRISONER. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he will explain on what charge John Mathews, of cold-well Street, Glasthule, Co. Dublin, has been arrested and is still detained, whether he signed the usual form of undertaking nearly four weeks ago, and is prepared to give any guarantees the Military require of his good behaviour. 
     
    
      
       John Mathews was arrested on suspicion of doing intelligence work for the Irregulars.  Although he has signed the usual form of undertaking, it is not considered advisable to release him, at present. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - A CORK MOTOR CAR. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that National troops took a Cubitt motor car from Mr. Philip Duggan, of 45 Oliver Plunket Street, Cork, on the 5th September, 1922, at Macroom, and   have kept it since then; also, whether he is aware that Mr. Duggan was arrested on that date, kept for three weeks and then released, and what was the reason for taking the car and its detention, and whether Mr. Duggan will be compensated for the loss of the car and the loss of business due to its and his detention. 
     
    
      
       It should be stated that Mr. Duggan was arrested on the 19th of August for driving Irregulars. He signed the usual declaration, and was released on the plea that he had acted under duress.  He was re-arrested on the 5th September in Macroom, on a similar charge, and his car was seized for obvious reasons.  After investigation of the charge, he was released.  The car has been detained owing to its having been damaged in an accident.  The question of compensation will be considered in due course. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - MILITARY ACTION NEAR KANTURK. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that on Monday, 9th October, 1922, a party of National troops returning from Green Hall to Kanturk fired at the house of Mrs. Fitzgerald, broke her windows and smashed her furniture, and what is the reason for such action on the part of the troops. 
     
    
      
       Enquiries are being made, but they have not yet been completed. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - COMMANDEERING A MOTOR CAR IN ROSCOMMON. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether it is a fact that the National Forces at Roscommon hold a Chevrolet car the property of Joseph O'Dea, of Lake View House, Glenamaddy, whether the car has been in the possession of the Military for over four months, whether the owner, who carries on a motor hiring business, has, in consequence suffered considerable loss, and whether he will give instructions to have this car restored at once.  Further, if he will say whether Mr. O'Dea will be compensated for loss of business due to the withholding of the car, and for cost of repairs consequent on its use meantime by the   Military.  Also if he will inquire whether a sum of £16, due to Mr. O'Dea by the Army authorities, and for which application has yet been made on several occasions has yet been paid him, and if not will he see that the matter gets immediate attention. 
     
    
      
       The same answer applies in this case as in the previous one. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - ARMY CLOTHING CONTRACTS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether any contracts for army clothing have been given to a firm known as Cohen and Wilkes, of Manchester; if not, whether he is aware that any Irish contractor for army clothing has sublet his contract to English clothing manufacturers, and if not already aware of this, will he demand of all contractors the information of where the clothing they have contracted for is being made. 
     
    
      
       An urgent order for trench coats was given to the firm of Cohen and Wilkes about May last. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - A LEIX PRISONER. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that James Daly, District Councillor, Rathdowney, Leix, was arrested about ten weeks ago, and has since been detained in Kilkenny Jail, without having any charge preferred against him, whether he is aware that the prisoner has agreed to sign the usual undertaking, and whether he is prepared to order his immediate release, or state the reasons why he was arrested and is still being detained. 
     
    
      
       Daly was arrested on the ground of aiding Irregulars. He has signed the required form of undertaking and the question of his immediate release is receiving favourable consideration. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - PRISON OFFICERS. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether he has received an application from the President of the Prisons Officers' Association, claiming on behalf of the Prisons Officers, a definite announcement as to what the Government's intention is towards   those who may be anxious and willing to continue their services, and what are the definite maximum terms which will be given to those who may voluntarily retire, or who may be retired or discharged in consequence of the change of Government.  If so, will he now state the nature of the proposed reply.  Further, will he say whether it is the intention of the Government to dispense with the services of the existing Prisons Officers, when they have served its purpose during the present critical period, on account of their having been servants of the British Government heretofore. 
     
    
      
       An application of the nature indicated has been received through the General Prisons Board.  It is not the intention of the Government to dispense with the services of the existing Prison Officers merely because they were servants of the British Government.  As regards compensation, any public servant who is discharged or who retires in consequence of the change of Government is entitled under Article 10 of the Treaty to compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920. As already announced in the Dail, the Government has set up a Committee consisting of two official representatives and two representatives of the staff with an impartial Chairman to advise as to the compensation payable and all matters connected therewith, and I must decline to prejudice the proceedings of that Committee by making any statement of the Government's views on matters yet to be decided by that Committee. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - CIVIL SERVANTS' SUPERANNUATION. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether it is a fact that a large number of existing Civil Servants are entitled to have the Provisions of the Superannuation Act of 1909 applied to them on retirement; whether on voluntary retirement, or on being retired or discharged in consequence of the change of Government, or on abolition of office, the provisions of that Superannuation Act will continue to apply to them.  If not, will he state on what grounds those provisions are being withdrawn. 
     
     
    
      
       Any Civil Servant who is discharged or who retires in consequence of the change of Government is entitled under Article 10 of the Treaty to compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920.  As already announced in the Dail, the Government has set up a Committee consisting of two official representatives and two representatives of the staff with an impartial Chairman to advise as to the compensation payable and all matters connected therewith, and I must decline to prejudice the proceedings of that Committee by making any statement of the Government's view on matters yet to be decided by the Committee.  Any Civil Servant, of course, who comes under the Superannuation Act, 1909, is entitled to have any compensation which may be awarded to him computed under that Act. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - REMUNERATION OF PRISON OFFICIALS WHO WORK AT THEIR TRADES. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether it is a fact that a number of officers, male and female, in the Prisons Service, are employed working at their different trades in the prisons, without receiving any additional remuneration; whether, during the British regime, those officers were in receipt of 10s. per week extra; whether the work of those officers means a big saving for the State, by reason of the fact, that their pay, bonus and emoluments are much less than Trades Union wages in the outside world; whether applications have been made for payment of this allowance to officers so employed, and if so, will he now say if it is the intention to sanction such payment, and when the sanction will be given. 
     
    
      
       Most of the officers employed at their trades in the Prisons Service receive additional remuneration either as Engineers with a special scale of pay, Artisan Warders with a special allowance of 10s. a week, or Trade Instructors with allowances at a variable rate up to £28 per annum. In a few instances men and women employed on trial as Trade Instructors receive no allowance and are regarded as qualifying for the grant of the allowance as vacancies arise.  Owing to the extensive repairs necessary in recent years   due to damage caused by prisoners the Prisons Board in August, 1920, obtained the approval of the British Treasury for the employment of not more than thirty additional Temporary Warders with an allowance of 10s. per week when employed as Artisan Warders to carry out structural repairs and alterations.  This sanction was renewed in July, 1921, but was limited to the financial year ended 31st March, 1922.  In March, 1922, the Prisons Board asked the British Treasury for authority to continue the 10s. allowance to temporary warders employed as Artisans and also for sanction for the payment of a similar allowance to permanent warders when fully employed at their trades.  No decision was, however, received and accordingly the payment of the 10s. allowance to temporary warders employed as Artisans ceased on 31st March, 1922.  The employment of prison officers as Artisans enables the Prisons Board to carry out certain work economically and the system has certainly effected a saving. Representations have been made to this Ministry by the Prisons Board on behalf of the officers concerned.  The matter is at present under consideration and the Minister of Finance is being asked to sanction certain recommendations. The question will be settled in the course of a few days. 
     
   
   
     CONSTITUTION OF SAORSTAT EIREANN BILL - AS AMENDED ON REPORT. 
    
      
       It is my privilege to move that this Bill be now passed. We have been considering it for upwards of a month.  Certain amendments undoubtedly calculated to improve the Bill have been accepted and embodied in the draft, but substantially the Constitution stands as presented to the Dail. The Constitution confers on Ireland the status of co-equal membership of the British community of Nations known as the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It declares that all powers of Government and of authority, legislative, executive and judicial are derived from the people of Ireland.  And if there were more thought in Ireland of those Articles and all that those Article imply, there would, I am confident, be less turmoil in the   country and less difficulty about the acceptance of the Constitution.  It is because things have been happening in Ireland so big and so rapidly that the public mind has failed to grasp them, that there is trouble through the country. And it is because there is in Ireland the irresponsibility of a people that has not been doing its own housekeeping for many a long year and century that the public mind has failed to grasp them.  And I feel that it will take some months, or possibly a longer period of the actual working of this Constitution before people realise to the full the degree of freedom which it bestows. The Constitution, someone said, is the mechanics of Government.  And people will have to see that mechanism at work before the full effect, the full dimensions of the change are brought home to their minds.  The Constitution was an interpretation of the Treaty; and the Treaty conferred on Ireland the Constitutional status of Canada.  And Canada being rather far away people here, many people here, at any rate, have very little idea of the extent of freedom enjoyed by the citizens of that country. Canada is by the full admission of British Statesmen equal in status with Great Britain and is as free as Great Britain.  She has complete control of her own destiny.  The supremacy of the British Parliament over the Dominions has ceased to exist.  They are not subordinate dependencies, but free Nations equal in status to Great Britain and united with her only on the basis of free and friendly co-operation in what is known as the Commonwealth of Nations, as distinct from Empire.  A multitude of statements by responsible statesmen in Great Britain and Canada embody this quality of independence. &ldquo;In actual fact Canada has complete legislative and fiscal independence in the widest sense of the word.  The British Parliament cannot impose laws upon Canada and exercises no control whatever over Canada.  The Crown has no authority in Canada.  It signifies sentiment only.&rdquo;  That is the view of the status of Canada taken by one whom some people consider an eminent constitutional authority.  That is the view and those are the words of Mr. Erskine Childers, ex-T.D.  There has been certain criticism here directed to showing that the Constitution embodies a   cutting down, a dwindling down of the status and rights that the Treaty gave. That, of course, is, and must remain, a matter of opinion.  We have given our opinion.  We gave it here on the day we introduced this Draft, and nothing that has since transpired here has caused us to alter that opinion, and it is that this Constitution is a strict and fair interpretation of the Treaty.  There is at present what is called a political crisis in England.  I think we have reason to congratulate ourselves that to a very large extent we have become independent of political variations in England. I think, too, that looking back on last December we can agree that it was a sound view that there was then a flood tide and all the portents then pointed to the return of party politics in England. You had in power then a political combination which would carry its measures in the House of Commons, and still more important, could carry its measures in the House of Lords, and the signatories took that full tide.  No single Party Government faced with a formidable political opposition could, I believe, carry a settlement such as the Treaty signed last December through both Houses in England.  Only a great political Coalition formed from the two big political parties in England could have carried that, and the most mature political mind we had in Ireland, a political mind and acumen that is now lost to Ireland, saw that, and seeing it acted in strict conformity with its oath and did the best thing for the Irish Nation in the circumstances that had arisen.  Two men signed that Treaty. They have been described here, most aptly described, one as the greatest sower and the other as the greatest reaper that this country has ever known. This Constitution should be prized by the people.  It was won in toil, in danger, and in stress.  It was negotiated on the cliff's edge, and it gives to Ireland the care of her own household.  It puts into the hands of the Irish people the making and moulding, and the amending or repealing of their own laws. It gives them full fiscal control; it gives them power to develop in peace and reconstruction towards the fullness of National life.  And the people of Ireland, despite certain superficial symptoms to the contrary, appreciate that fact, and the people in Ireland will   travel that road of peace and progress and reconstruction, realising that never yet did a country that went to war attain 100 per cent. of its war programme, realising the big thing that has been won, and realising above all the spirit in which it was won, the spirit that brought success and which gives us this to-day.  The greatest man that ever served the cause of an oppressed nation achieved this thing, and having achieved it, gave as the last final proof of his conviction of its worth, his gallant life. In presenting it to our countrymen, we can find no fitter words to use to them than the words he used to them: &ldquo;The country is yours for the making, make it.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       I formally second the motion. 
     
    
      
       I think it right for me to say a word or two on this final stage of this Constitution Bill.  I am one who still thinks, despite the disavowal of the Minister, that the Constitution Bill does not embody all the liberties for Ireland that were contained, or might have been interpreted to have been contained, in the Treaty.  Very shortly after the Treaty was signed and published, I wrote certain words which were endorsed by the Labour Party at a formal Conference, something to this effect&mdash;that the Treaty was the fruit of the effort of the people to whom the political fortunes of the country had been entrusted, that they had done their best, that they believed it was the utmost they could achieve, and we were prepared to do what we could with the political instrument that had resulted from their efforts.  We said then, and we say now, that it does not embody or satisfy the demands of the country for self-determination, and that demand will probably have to be worked for, if not fought for, for quite a long time. Nevertheless we said that so far as the individual citizen was concerned, as distinct from the nation, so far as the individual citizen within the nation, as distinct from the nation within the world of nations, was concerned, the freedom that was granted under the terms of the Treaty was such freedom as would guarantee 999 days out of 1,000 of any individual's life within the nation.  The country has power under this Treaty, and I am willing to admit,   under the Constitution, to control the lives and the fortunes of the citizens for 999 days out of every 1,000 days of the life of the citizens.  We can, I believe, make of the Constitution what we will. From it we can develop and grow into full and complete and absolute national enfranchisement if we will.  But I want to make this demurrer, and it is that while we have achieved, or may achieve, through the instrument of the Treaty and the Constitution, political freedom and enfranchisement, we must continuously bear in mind that political freedom and enfranchisement is but sounding brass and tinkling cymbals unless we use that freedom for the purpose of social, economic and cultural freedom.  I fear that the signs are that we are not going to use the political freedom to achieve social, economic and cultural freedom, social and economic and cultural self-development.  I am afraid that the signs are that we are likely to forget that a greater effort still is required, within the country's own life, to free ourselves from the incubus of capitalism and all the accompaniments of capitalism.  It has been pointed out very eloquently and, I think, subscribed to by the great majority of those who have been thoughtful adherents of the Sinn Fein and Gaelic Movements, that the real subjugation of the life of the people of Ireland was the economic and social and cultural subjugation, and that the political was but an instrument to that end.  And unless we are going to use the political freedom to the end of releasing the country and the people of the country from its other subjections, nothing has been achieved.  After all, nationality, nationhood, is but a means to an end.  Unfortunately too many have thought, and think, that the political institutions, even the social and economic institutions, which they strive to amend and change, are ends in themselves, but they are not; they are institutions and organisations intended so to assist in the development of individual life, the human material that we are and are surrounded by; to mould and develop and improve that humanity, that these institutions exist; and to think of nationhood, of political freedom, and of national Parliaments and political institutions of one kind or another as something to be achieved, and then to finish, is the greatest possible mistake.   You must at all times bear in mind that, great as they are, they are but instruments to a greater end, that end being the development of the individual, the improvement of the race.  And I want to lay stress upon this.  The country is in a state somewhat of fluidity, and it is possible to-day, if we will, to change the habits of thinking, to change the social practices, to change the economic environment during this period of fluidity, whereas if we allow things to stabilise in their present forms, if we allow vested interests to be solidified, we are going to find it very difficult indeed, without a new revolution, to make the country what it ought to be.  I would plead with the Ministers, with the members of the Dail, and with the public generally, to take advantage of the present opportunities to modify the circumstances which have bound the country to the system, economic, social and cultural, which was imposed for the purpose of maintaining the hold of another and an alien civilisation upon this country.  We must remember that there is with all of us a desire to get the greatest end by the easiest means, and in economic affairs that is tending to the supremacy of the big machine, to wholesale mass production, and, through that wholesale mass production, a driving out of the possibilities of self-development within this country.  If we are not going to face that issue boldly and without too much regard for present vested interests, we are going to find that the political achievement is not going to be of much avail.  We will need to put a barrier&mdash;some kind of an obstacle of a psychological and an economic kind&mdash; upon the desire of the people to get the most for the least.  I am referring to the demand for cheapness in the market commodities; I am now referring to the demand for cheapness in the labour market, the human commodity, as human labour, unfortunately, is considered. We have got to get away from this idea that human labour must be bought as cheaply as possible, irrespective of the consequences to humanity; and that we must be free to buy the things that we require in the cheapest market, irrespective of the consequences to Irish humanity.  And if we do not face the consequences of that principle, we are not going to get anywhere   through this Constitution.  This may seem a little bit distant from the motion that is moved by the Minister, but it is very necessary, in my opinion, that we should direct our minds to the facts underlying the impulses which have led to this political revolution.  It has been a revolution.  We see it round about us; anybody who will look at the obvious things cannot deny it.  We see people in power who a very few years ago would have thought it preposterous to imagine that they were going to sit on Government benches in power, and the old ascendancy accepting their defeat.  It is a revolution.  But let us not forget that there must be something beyond that political revolution, and it must find expression in a change in the material outlook, in the educational outlook, in the social outlook&mdash;a complete change in human relations.  I believe it is possible within this Constitution, faulty as it is, to grow and develop on lines which will mean the re-establishment of a Commonwealth in which humanity has the first place, and property and property relations will be placed in their proper position, secondary to humanity and to human relations.  If we accept that ideal &mdash;if we face the responsibilities that the acceptance of that ideal will impose upon us&mdash;then we can do great things for this country.  But, in accepting that ideal and in accepting those responsibilities, we will have to fight very hard indeed against the tendency to allow the big financial interests&mdash;the international financial interests&mdash;to get a hold upon this country.  The more promise we make for prosperity, the greater the temptation will be for these financial interests to get hold, and I would ask the Minister for Finance particularly to see how easy it would be to do nationally by the nation in its organised capacity, with finance, what the bankers do, in fact, in their own private interests.  We are going, if we are not careful, to put our necks in the noose, and it will only require the will of the financier at some future date to draw tight the noose, and we shall be strangled.  We can, if we will, clear ourselves from that in the earlier stages of our history, but we can only do it by realising that the bankers build upon their faith in the possibility of the social life of the country building up the economic life.  And it is on the   collective effort of the people and their faith in the collective efforts of the people, on whom the bankers make their profit, on which they build their ascendancy. I am asking now that the Ministers will themselves, on behalf of the nation, do this work for the nation without the intervention of these big financial interests.  This, again, I say, is not apart from the motion before the Dail. It immediately arises out of it, because without an economic future, without a looking beyond the mere political change that has taken place, the political change is going to be of no avail. 
     
    
      
       I am glad we have got to the Final Reading of this Bill, because if the Bill must go through in its present form, it is better that it should go through in that way than that it should not go through at all, and I am the first to recognise&mdash;little as I like many of these provisions&mdash;it is better that the Bill should go through in this form than that it should not go through at all.  Now, the Treaty was a big thing, a bad thing in many ways, but necessary, in so far as it was bad, still on the whole a big thing, because it was a big thing to get English Statesmen with all their truculence to sign the document that they did sign.  The Constitution is far less a big thing.  The Minister spoke of attacks upon the Constitution based upon the grounds that they cut down our Treaty rights.  To some extent I think the Constitution does cut down our rights.  Nevertheless, substantially in the big things it secures those rights, and my objection to it, as it now stands, is not so much grounded upon its failure to give us all that the Treaty entitled us to have, as upon the fact, first that many things are expressed vaguely and uncertainly, so that if we have weak Ministries hereafter, England will be in a position to get much more out of this Constitution, as against Ireland, than she should be in the position to get; and secondly that there are other things in the Constitution expressed in a way that is offensive to the National dignity.  A mere matter of form it may be said, but I think that matter of form is important to the Irish Nation, and that is why as one of the signatories I have felt it a duty to protest against these items when they came along in the course of the discussions on the draft, and I am glad to note one change that has arisen in the course of this debate.   As it appeared to me, when the debate was introduced, the Constitution was introduced rather as a natural outcome of the document signed last December, just such as Ireland might very properly expect to have, and I, and other members too, have thought that they have noticed a growing recognition in Ministerial quarters of the fact that the document now presented to us is not the natural interpretation of the document signed last December, but is an interpretation forced by circumstances, so that it is now generally recognised, and the fact is important, for those who come after us, can look back on the record of this difficult time&mdash;it is generally recognised this document is one which would not be in its present form were it not for the duress of present circumstances, and more particularly of the civil war.  That is something to the good.  We have had various amendments which have not gone far to remove the objections that I felt to the Constitution.  We have one amendment which is very important, and upon which I congratulate the Ministry, and that is the insertion of power to amend the Constitution quite easily in more normal times than the present, which is a power that is valuable and a proper power to insert in the Constitution.  So far as I am concerned I recognise one big thing about this Constitution, and it is this, that with all that is bad in it, nevertheless there is there a sufficient volume of substantial good to enable Ireland to go ahead on its own lines without outside interference, and that after all is the thing that matters most. To that extent I am glad to have this Constitution through.  We are now at the stage when this Constitution is through, when Irish Ireland will for the first time have an opportunity of developing upon its own lines, upon the only lines that will make an Ireland worth preserving and an Ireland worth having. Such an Ireland as that we can get when this Constitution has been put into force, because we shall be free to develop upon our own natural lines. 
     
    
      
       I was wondering, during the observations of the last Deputy, whether he was torn between two impulses&mdash;to damn the Constitution with faint praise, or the other better impulse of being convinced of its virtues. I have very little to say on this matter, but there are one or two things that   should be said at a stage when we are putting the finishing touches to this international contract.  When this stage is finished Ireland will have discharged her part of the contract, and Ireland, in my judgement, will have achieved the greatest triumph in her history since the Battle of Kinsale.  She will have recovered the vital powers that give her control over her own destiny.  There are limitations in the Constitution, just as there are disagreeable limitations in the lives of every human being.  But there is in the Constitution the principle of growth, and that flexibility which will enable the people of this nation to mould her institutions in a way that will secure, in so far as it is possible to secure, that consideration of humanities upon which Deputy Johnson dwelt with such stress. This is not only a great instrument for national well-being; it is a monument to two great men who have passed away. I believe that future generations, deriving the advantages this instrument will confer upon them, and living in the fulness of the liberty that they will derive from it, and also living within the protection of the development of this Constitution, will bless the names of these two great men.  I think it is only right, when we have reached the closing stages of this debate, that that should be said.  They have discharged their part, and they have given Ireland exemplars of what self-sacrifice and devotion to national duty should be.  The main thing I rose to say is this: when we have finished this stage of the proceedings Ireland will have discharged her part of the contract; it will remain for England to fulfil her part.  I am not suggesting that there will be any action on the part of the British Government which will jeopardise what has been won with so much labour and sacrifice by the Irish nation.  We have to look beyond the mere passing of the Constitution Bill through the British Parliament, and we have to look forward to the equitable carrying into effect of what will arise out of the Constitution, and out of certain decisions which certain of our countrymen may make in the North-East.  We want to use this instrument, and the powers Ireland gets through the Treaty, not as a means to further estrange one section of the Irish people from another. We want to use it to bring together those of our people in the North-East who are   estranged from us, so that there shall be reconciliation and unity and goodwill between all sections.  When the time comes for certain steps to be taken to deal with that situation, we desire that England will stand as faithfully by her part in the transaction as, in justice to the English statesmen who have been responsible for what has been done up to the present, she has done.  I sound that note, not so much as one of warning, but rather as a suggestion.  That is the next great step that Ireland has to consider and it is my fervent hope that the conclusion of this Treaty, in all its implications, will have the result of bringing together, instead of accentuating the present differences of opinion, the people of the North of Ireland with those of the South, and bringing them to realise that their interests are as much bound up and dependent upon the national progress as are the interests of Irishmen, whether they be from Cork, Tipperary, or Dublin. I want to sound that note so that at this stage there will go out to the men of the North-East a message of goodwill from this National Assembly.  The note we wish to strike is one of reconciliation and goodwill, and we hope to see reconciliation and goodwill operating through the medium of the Treaty and the Constitution. 
     
    
      
       As is appropriate, my contribution will be very brief.  Since I have, according to the little measure of my powers and opportunities, debated continuously and, I may claim, too, pertinaciously, some of these articles, it is only right that I should give the Constitution mild benediction, now that it leaves the Dail a very much better instrument than when it entered it. We have now in retrospect to recognise there are at least four very important modifications in the Draft Constitution. all making for betterment.  We have the amendment by which women are recognised as citizens, with all the reasonable and equitable consequences to be drawn therefrom.  We have the further amendment, for which I am particularly grateful, not merely to the Dail, but in an especial measure to the Ministry&mdash;to wit. the restoration to An Dail of representation for Universities.  That was made, you will recollect, a non-controversial Article&mdash;the new Article dealing with representation in the Dail.  The Whips were   not put on, and it was left open, and many Members of the Ministerial Party supported it, not merely in the effective way of voting, but in the still more effective mode of recommendation to the Dail by speech.  A certain daily paper, commenting upon this amendment, declares: &ldquo;University representation is now embedded in the Constitution. It is so, because it was regarded as a short-cut for the provision of representation to the Protestant minority.  For no other reason would it be tolerable.&rdquo;  Now it is a duty that I owe to my colleagues here, to recognise that the history which that purports to give of this very important and highly valuable amendment of the Constitution, is utterly at variance with what we know to be the correct account.  At no time when this amendment was before the Dail was it recommended on any such grounds, and one of the chief recommendations of it was that it is one of those alterations which would make our Constitution more characteristically an Irish Constitution as bringing into the construction of the future Ireland elements and influences which belong to our past traditions. There is another amendment which I think we have to congratulate ourselves upon, and that is with regard to the Executive Council; but above all the most valuable, to my mind, is that machinery provided in Article 50 by which any amendment of this Constitution may be made within a period of eight years by way of ordinary legislation. If the Constitution had only a few Articles and that Article as well, it would still be an excellent thing.  I do not suggest at all nor would I be taken to declare that there are things missing from the Constitution that are better away.  I can conceive of amendments&mdash; but I must in justice confess, at the same time, when we bear in mind and have fully present to our recollection all the unfavourable conditions under which the Draft Constitution was conceived, and all the hostile and inimical influences against it being a better document than it might reasonably have been, we ought to be very, very grateful indeed that the Constitution is so excellent a thing as we now behold it. 
     
    
      
       I am not rising to take the opportunity of damning the Constitution with faint praise, or for that matter of praising it with faint   damns.  I rose to support the Second Reading because I believed that the machinery embodied in the Constitution was the machinery of freedom; but I believed that that machinery could be improved.  I am rising to support this Final Reading and to urge its passage unanimously because I think that machinery has been improved substantially and materially, improved in many ways, and as a result, we have a Constitution to-day that does bestow freedom on the Irish people.  Possibly one may think that there are certain matters in which that machinery might have been improved even more substantially than it has been.  Those are natural regrets, and one might almost think sometimes that amendments for that improvement might possibly have been received a little more cordially, and I regret to say, sometimes a little more courteously, than they were.  Those are regrets, however, that one necessarily puts behind one.  I recognise, and the entire Dail recognises, that this is a moment of no ordinary sort in the history of the Nation.  We are bestowing upon ourselves as a Nation a Constitution, and whatever happens in the future, that Constitution will be the fundamental machinery by which we, as a nation, will conduct our own affairs, for ourselves, for our common advantage as a people, and by which we will raise our heads among the nations of this earth and claim that we have in substance, and in very considerable substance, restored to ourselves that dignity that we once held, and now again hold. It is for that reason, and because it is a Constitution in which the Irish people may exercise freedom, that one supports it now, and I think that it would be proper to an occasion like this&mdash;advantage should be taken of a moment of this kind &mdash;to remember that the nation at large is looking upon this scene.  We have had an eye looking on this scene that will report the material substance of what is occurring to the nation at large; but I am thinking not merely of photographs that will report the exterior substance.  I am thinking that generations to come will look upon this scene and will know that here on this day certain work was done, of which we ourselves do not recognise the magnitude because we are living in the midst of these scenes.  Future generations will realise it, and future generations   will prove that freedom was wrought and that the machinery was of such a kind that it could improve itself, and could extend, and it could become supple with use, in order that the nation might develop and in order that the Constitution might develop with the development of the nation.  But in that connection a thought was with me that has not been expressed, and had it been expressed I would not have arisen.  It is this: The nation even now, in spite of many distractions, does recognise that important work is being done, and I believe&mdash;and it is possible I have some inward substance for the belief&mdash;that many people who are now in arms against the will of the Irish people equally will recognise that when this Constitution shall have been passed by this Dail, and shall have been prescribed by the act of this Dail, whatever promulgations may hereafter proceed, that that work will have, even for those who are in opposition to this body, a certain finality which they should recognise. They will oppose, and their thoughts will centre around the existence of the person whose name occurs so often in the Constitution&mdash;the king.  But, speaking with the recognition of that dignity and that courtesy that the occasion requires, one can only say here in this country what would be said in any country respecting the dignitary to whom I have referred. I do not know whether any members of this Dail play the ancient game of chess. We know that in the ancient game of chess the king is a very important person among all the men, but that his moves are restricted to one square at a time, and that he is a target for every other piece.  He is a singularly helpless person, and ultimately if the game proceeds to its conclusion he gets caught, and I think that Kings in Constitutions are like kings in chess, and that really the important piece in the Constitution is that person whoever it may be that is chosen to be the Premier or President. I hope the President of this Assembly will not think I am making any reflection upon him when I say that the most important person on the chess board is the Queen.  The most important person in the Irish State under this Constitution will be the Executive Council that will be responsible to the Legislature set up by the Irish people.  The machinery of this Constitution is such that the King merely becomes ultimately   the voice by which the will of the Irish people is expressed.  I ask if there can be any one thing that the Irish people or any persons in this country desire more than to have that will expressed, because it is in the expression of that will, and not otherwise, freedom can always be attained.  And if they do so desire, or if they have any wish or leaning towards the ultimate expression of that will, at any rate and in any event I do urge, not here merely, but even more widely, that the act of this day, or the act we have now entered upon, should be recognised by the people who are to-day in arms against the authority of this Dail, and that they should recognise that now that the Constitution has been enacted, though they do not regard certain parts of its machinery with any excess of affection, still that they should nevertheless recognise that when that act is completed on behalf of the Irish Nation it behoves the minority of that Nation to work through and try that act and to come in and put the thing to the test, and to see whether the machinery that will be passed here is or is not necessary to achieve that substance of freedom for the Nation&mdash;that substance of freedom for the Nation being that the Nation desires to live a certain form of life.  And that the desire of the Nation can be achieved by the machinery of legislative and Executive functions, and that is what this Constitution does.  For that reason I support it here as I supported it before, and for that reason I would like to take this particular opportunity &mdash;perhaps a person unfitted for it&mdash;to urge upon my fellow-countrymen who are to-day in arms against the Irish people that now that the Irish people through their Legislative Assembly, through this Constituent Assembly, have decided upon this Constitution&mdash;that they should recognise that act as having a certain finality though not the restricted finality that at one time appeared to be possible before Article 50 was amended into its present form, and to recognise that there should be peace in this country, and by means of this Constitution advantage taken of the opportunity that seldom befalls any people.  Because we here can start development to-day.  To use the language of the sporting men we can start from scratch.  We can experiment in freedom as no nation to-day can experiment in freedom.  By means of   the expression of the will of the Irish people in and through this Constitution we can achieve that object to which Deputy Johnson has so eloquently referred, that is the economic freedom and social freedom without which freedom is merely a thing spelled with letters and has no actuality at all.  I urge, therefore, that not merely this Dail should pass the Constitution and pass it unanimously, but that in the same spirit this Nation should also pass it and pass it expressly with consent and unanimously, working it for all it is worth in the common advantage of all, and to the utmost advantage of each. 
     
    
      
       Ni labhrochainn ar an gceist seo chor ar bith indiu, mar tuigim i gcomhnuidhe gur fearr gniomh na ceist, acht silim nar cheart, coir no feileamhneach bille mar seo, a bhfuil an oiread sin dluth-bhaint aige le sean na h-Eireann, a leigean thrid gan labhairt in a thaoibh i dteangaidh arsa ar dtire fein.  Ag tracht dom ar seo, ta suil le Dia agam gur gearr e an t-am go mbeidh teachtai uile an Tighe seo i ndan cursai na h-Eireann go h-iomlan a chur thri na cheile i dteangaidh bhinn na nGaedheal, agus fos go mbeidh siad sa riocht gach dlighe faoi chomhair a dtire a cheapadh i nGaedhilg. 
       Ta a fhios agam, gidh gur mor an cheim ar aghaidh dar dtir an Bun-Reacht seo ata os bhur gcomhair a dheanamh in a dlighe, nach bhfuil an Bun-Reacht sin gan aon locht.  Nuair a thugamar ar bhotai ar son an Chonnartha idir Eire agus Shasana i dtus na bliadna seo, thuigeamar go maith an uair sin go gcaithfeadh an Bun-reacht a bheith lochtach i neithibh aithridhe, de bharr nach raibh de chomhacht againn an t-am sin an buadh criocnuighthe a fhaghail ar an Sasanach agus e a dhibirt glan as Eirinn.  An cuid againn a ghlach leis an gConnradh an uair ud, rinneamar e ar mhaithe leis an tir, agus mar gheall ar go mb'annsa linn sean agus maitheas na h-Eireann na cuid de na smaointe a bhi go doimhin i nar gcroidhthe fein. 
       Ta go leor leor maitheasa san mBun-Reacht seo, agus tiubhraidh se deis do'n naisiun fos a dheanamh, agus beidh bealach againn faoi leis an tir a Ghaedhealu. 
     
     B'aoibhinn le gach duine in Eirinn clann na h-Eireann go h-uile a bheadh ar aon bhuille amhain, agus gan dealu no as-aondacht a bheith eatorra.  Ta toir mhor   againn go dtiucfaidh an dream ata san gcuinne thoir thuaidh d-Eirinn isteach in aoinfheacht linn, ach san am cheadna, nil sinn ag umhlu dhoibh in aon chaoi. Beidh se ar mhaithe leo fein a thigheacht faoi aon bhrat linn, agus beidh failte agus cothrom le faghail aca nuair a thiucfas siad. 
     Molaim an Bille daoibh. 
    
      
       A Chinn Chomhairle, bhios fein chun eirighte nuair a dh'eirigh an Teachta Padraig o Maille agus an smaoineamh cheadna am aigne agam agus do nocht seisean, gur ceart go labhairfeadh duine eigin i nGaedhilg ar an ocaid seo, ar chur i bhfeidhm an Bhun-reachta duinn.  Is docha go bhfuilimid ar aon aigne sa Dail seo indiu gur ceart an Bun-reacht do chur i bhfeidhm gan a thuille righnis.  Ta cuid againn anso, go deimhin, agus ba bhreagh linn da bhfeadfai an Bun-reacht d'fheabhasu ar slighthibh.  Ach tuigimid go soleir anois nach feidir e athru go foil.  Ar ball, b'fheidir, i n-aimsir siothchana, nuair a bheidh athru saoghail i n-Eirinn, beidh caoi ag lucht Dala na tire an Bun-reacht d'athru agus d'fheabhasu.  Acht nuair nach feidir e d'athru fe lathair, is fearr e chur i bhfeidhm gan mhoill agus gan tuille cainte.  Nuair a bheidh se i bhfeidhm againn-ne beidh ar d-taobh-na de'n mhargadh coimhlionta againn&mdash;an margadh do dheineadh idir teachtairi Eireann agus teachtairi Shasana sa Chonnradh a sighnigheadh i Lundain i mi na Nodlag anuraidh. 
       Taimid ag brath&mdash;pe athru riaghaltais a thuithfidh amach i Sasana&mdash;agus dreir deallraimh ta athru riaghaltais ar siubhal ann fe lathair agus deallraimh go mbeidh athru eile ann aris sara fada&mdash;taimid ag brath go gcoimhlionfar riaghaltas Shasana a gcuid fein de'n mhargadh go ceart agus go macanta.  B'feidir gur fearr gan puinn a radh a thaisbeanfadh aon amhras fe lathair.  Ach ni h-aon diobhail an meid seo a radh, agus ni baoth-chaint e, gur cheart go dtuigfeadh aon riaghaltas i Sasana treis ar thuit amach i n-Eirinn le se no seacht mbliadhain gur fearra dhoibh an margadh do choimhlionadh go macanta.  Mura ndeinean siad an rud ceart an turus so beidh i gcumas muintire na h-Eireann beart eile a dheanamh.  Ta fonn ar mhuintir na h-Eireann siothchain a dheanamh leo, ach ni mor do mhuintir Shasana a thaisbeaint go bhfuil fonn siothchana ortha fein chomh maith. 
     
     
        Ta suil againn chomh maith, mar a dhubhairt an Teachta Sean Mac Giolla 'n Riogh, go ndeanfaidh na h-Ultaigh, lucht Bheilfeirsde, an rud ceart. 
     Taimid ag brath go dtiocfaidh siad siud isteach fe Dail Eireann sa deire agus go mbeidh an tir ar fad fe aon reim amhain. 
     Ta rudai sa Bhun-reacht na taithneann le cuid againn.  Ach ta so deimhnightheach am thuairim-se go dtugann se an chaoi agus go dtugann se an chomhacht do mhuintir na h-Eireann saoirse iomlan do bhaint amach doibh fein nuair is maith leo e sin a dheanamh agus nuair a bheidh caoi ann chuige.  Is deimhin go bhfuil nios mo comhachta ag Gaedhealaibh de bharr an Bhun-reachta so na a bhi aca le breis is tri chead bliadhain. Ta an comhacht againn dul chun chinn ar an gcuma so: aigne na ndaoine do Ghaedhlu, na cursai oideacais do Ghaedhlu, meon agus intleacht na ndaoine do Ghaedhlu.  Buadh mor d-Eirinn iseadh e sin: go bhfuil an comhacht san againn i ndeire thiar thall treis an chogaidh fhada a dhein muintir na h-Eireann chun e bhaint amach.  Curtar an Bun-reacht i bhfeidhm agus fagtar fe mhuintir na h-Eireann an tairbhe ata ann do bhaint as agus an nimh ata ann, b'fheidir, do chaitheamh uatha nuair is maith agus is feidir leo. 
    
      
       Shiolas nar cheart an Bille Bun-reacht so do leigint tharainn gan focal no a dho a radh i nGaedhilg, ach thar eis a bhfuil raidhte ag Teachtai o'n Gaillimh agus o Chorcaigh, nil puinn agam-sa a radh i nGaedhilg anois acht a radh gur cuiduighim le gach aon fhocal a dhubhradar. 
     
     This Constitution, to my mind, is, as the Minister for Home Affairs carefully said, a strict but fair interpretation of the Treaty.  It may not be everything that everyone would desire in this country, but what it lacks are not things that are of really material essential value.  They are the trimmings that might be sentimentally valuable but substantially they are of very little consequence. The thing that really matters is we have in this instrument here now the framework and machinery without which a country cannot proceed in its own way to do its work by its own methods. Deputy Johnson seems to have some doubts about what this country may do   when it begins to operate under this Constitution.  He believes it might ally itself with agencies that might be detrimental and possibly disastrous and that vested interests and great combines of wealth might be availed by Ministers to the disadvantage of the general interests of the community.  Well I think that every individual in the community has vested interests, and I think that the vested interest in the right to live is one of the greatest vested interests in any community, and I think that is the vested interest which the country is likely to pay most attention to in the future and not vested interests which enable men to create monopoly and to engage in all sorts of combinations that will bring them wealth and affluence.  The most important thing for the country to consider will be the thing that any Government that is likely to receive the support of the people is bound to do and that is to see that the general body of the community are only considered and considered not so much in realition to their ability to accumulate wealth or to become very distinguished but to see that so far as possible the people of the country will be in such a way that if they are to succeed in the world they will not be prevented by any obstacle except something that is inherent in themselves and for which no arrangement can be made.  Deputy Gavan Duffy says that the Constitution has faults, and that it contains in itself things that are faulty.  I really cannot see where the faults in the Constitution lie.  I really believe that as a Constitution, so far as it was permissible within the terms of the Treaty, it is absolutely without fault from the point of view of a Nation like ours that wishes to proceed on its own lines and to do its own work.  Amendments made have been claimed credit for, and Deputy Magennis claims credit for four essential amendments that made great improvements in the Constitution, and particularly the one that deals with the right to amend the Constitution at any time and which secures University Representation.  These are amendments that are involved in the Constitution no doubt.  Now, I think that Deputy Figgis has fully estimated the importance that attaches to these little trimmings that are put into the Constitution.  England, of course, must have precedent, and must   follow formula in these things.  I suppose there are a certain amount of precedents that we are not free to break through, but I think this Bill lacks very little that the country had really at any time stood for.  It reminds me about a little squabble we had in our district about a steamship Sunday service.  The owner was a Sabbatarian.  After a lot of agitation it was agreed that we should get the steamship service, but there was one condition, and that was that the steamer should not whistle.  I think that applies to this Constitution&mdash;the whistle is not in it.  There are a lot of men going about and kicking up a big row because they are not allowed to whistle. Well, they may be able to whistle later on, if not &ldquo;The Marsellaise,&rdquo; at least &ldquo;A Nation Once Again,&rdquo; when they get into deep water, but not at the present time.  I support the passing of this Constitution, and I believe the Ministry deserve every credit for the attention and energy and earnestness they have concentrated on this business. I believe the Constitution itself provides for the nation a machine that, if it is properly used, will, despite the prognostications of Deputy Johnson, do the work in Ireland, and that we will have very few complaints to make. 
    
      
       Creidim gur maith an rud an Bun-Reacht do chur i bhfeidim.  Nil aon naire orm an rud san do ra.  Ta Teachtai anso adubhairt na fuil se cho maith leis an gConnradh do sighnigheadh i Lundain ar an 6adh la de Mhi na Nodlag, 1921.  Nilim ar aon intinn leo fe sin.  Creidim go bhfuil an Bun-reacht cho saor agus cho maith leis an gConnradh.  Na lochtanna adeirtear ata ann nil ionta ach lochtanna cainte.  Ta an tir seo anois fe n-ar gcuram fein agus ta an oiread san udarais againn agus a bheadh da mbeadh poblacht againn.  Ni bheidh aon chur isteach ag aon duine ar an dtir seo feasta ach an oiread agus da mbeadh poblacht againn agus sinn cho lag agus ataimid.  Nil an meid maoine agus saibhris againn do dheanfadh laidir i.  Ta an tir seo lag agus beidh si lag go ceann abhfad, agus ar an abhar san ni feidir lei bheith cho laidir agus do bheadh si da mbeadh saibhreas aici.  Ach fen mBhun-reacht so beimid saor i ngach aon tsli.  Beidh si cho saor, agus beidh na daoine cho saor agus a bheidis da mbeadh poblacht againn.  Is fior e go bhfuil sort ceannais   ag Ri Shasana orainn, ach ni bheidh aon chomhacht aige fen mBhun-reacht so na beadh aige da mbeadh poblacht againn.  Deirim-se, mar sin gur Bun-reacht maith an Bun-reacht so.  Bhi roint chainnte i dtaobh Airtiogail 50, ach do reir an Artiogail seo is feidir linn an Bun-reacht d'atharu gan pioc triobloide i rith na n-ocht mblian so chughainn.  Nuair a bhiomair ag deanamh diosboireachta ar an gceist seo d'aithnighmair go raibh a lan sa Bhun-reacht so nar thuigeamair i gceart, nar thuigeamair i gceart a mbri, agus da bharr san bhi eagla orainn go mbeadh a lan triobloide 'na thaobh agus go mbeadh a lan oibre i sna Cuirteanna le linn na huaire.  Mar sin ta sli againn san Airtiogal so chun rudai beaga do cheartu gan an sgeal mor do phle aris, agus sin e an fath go gcuirimid Airtiogal 50 mar ata se.  Ach ta fhios ag gach einne anso na fuil comhacht againn an Ri do chur amach as an mBun-reacht.  Ma cheapann aon duine gur feidir linne rudai do chur sa Bhun-reacht na ceaduionn an Connradh do dheanamh ta breall air. 
       Mar ata an Bhun-reacht anois fanfaidh, agus is maith an rud duinn an meid sin do thuisgint.  Ta suil agam na fuilimid ag smaoineamh ar na rudai ata in aigne Theachta Ghabhain ui Dhubhthaigh, ach ar aire do thabhairt do leas na tire agus do leas na ndaoine, chun slainte agus saol na ndaoine d'fheabhasu, agus an Ghaedhilg do chur chun cinn. 
     
    
      
       I beg to propose Amendment 1:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;To delete the word `Ireland's' in the fourth line of the preamble and to insert the words `of Ireland' in the same line between the word `unity' and the word `shall,' and to insert the word `the' between the word `that' and the word `National.'  The line will then read:&mdash;`That the national life and unity of Ireland shall thus be restored.' 
       It is not quite so formidable as it looks on paper.  It is merely transposing two words, and I think it improves the wording. 
     
    
      
       I second that. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Amendment 2.  Page 1, line 13&mdash;To delete the words &ldquo;Saorstat Eireann,&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;&ldquo;The Irish Free State (otherwise called &ldquo;Saorstat Eireann&rdquo;). 
     
     
        3.  Page 1, line 16&mdash;To delete the words &ldquo;Saorstat Eireann (The Irish Free State)&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;&ldquo;The Irish Free State (Saorstat Eireann).&rdquo; 
     4.  Page 2, line 10.&mdash;To delete the words &ldquo;The Irish Free State&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;&ldquo;the Irish Free State (Saorstat Eireann).&rdquo; 
     5.  Page 2, between lines 16/17&mdash;To insert &ldquo;The Irish Free State,&rdquo; and in line 17 to bracket the words &ldquo;Saorstat Eireann.&rdquo; 
     6.  Page 2, line 19.&mdash;To delete the words &ldquo;Saorstat Eireann&rdquo; and to insert the words &ldquo;(otherwise hereinafter called or sometimes called `Saorstat Eireann').&rdquo; 
    
      
       I think the Amendments 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 might be taken together. The object is to get in the words &ldquo;Saorstat Eireann&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;Irish Free State.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       I second. 
     
    
      
       I am not disagreeing in the very least, but I wish to know whether it was not agreed at an earlier stage by the Dail at large, on the suggestion of the Minister for Home Affairs, that in the English version the English title should precede the Irish titles, but that in the Irish version the Irish title should precede the English title, and that in both versions both should appear. 
     
    
      
       There will be no English title on the Irish version. The Minister made a suggestion with regard to four words.  The suggestion was not put formally and was not agreed to. 
     
    
      
       My suggestion was that the four words should be stereotyped and used in the English version, but in view of the exact wording of one Article of the Treaty I think we had better continue to use both words, &ldquo;Free State&rdquo; and &ldquo;Saorstat Eireann,&rdquo; and the other three words. I would make that suggestion. 
       Amendments agreed. 
     
    
      
       I ask your permission, Sir, before the Minister moves amendment 7, to mention that between 6 and 7 a matter arises that   will need attention at this point, which it occurs to me has not been noticed by the Ministry, and that is in respect of Article 11.  I would ask the Minister for Home Affairs if he will refer to Article 11 when he will see that it does not exactly carry out, in the words that appear, the suggestion that was agreed to, in order to obviate certain awkwardness in wording. To read it as a short sentence, without parenthesis, as I did once before:&mdash;&ldquo;All the lands and waters, mines and minerals within the territory of Saorstat Eireann hitherto vested in the State shall belong to the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  You have three titles there. You have Saorstat Eireann in the first; then surely instead of Irish Free State in the third you should get a repetition of Saorstat Eireann. 
     
    
      
       That is in line 53 you suggest Saorstat Eireann? 
     
    
      
       Is there not a formal amendment that the Irish Free State in line 53 should read &ldquo;Saorstat Eireann&rdquo;? 
     
    
      
       Would it be in order right through the Constitution to put in those words so that they should run always in the same order? 
     
    
      
       If you look at amendment 6 you will see that it provides for that. 
     
    
      
       You have it in Article 10. 
     
    
      
       You will remember, Sir, that Saorstat Eireann was accepted before instead of Irish Free State, just to avoid certain awkwardness in the wording, and if you avoid it in the first instance you must avoid it in the third, when the first and the third obviously are referring to the same thing. 
     
    
      
       It is provided by Amendment 6 that &ldquo;Irish Free State&rdquo; means Saorstat Eireann.' It is expressly provided. 
     
    
      
       If you carry your memory back to the original criticism that was made on this occasion it was decided, in this particular instance, to keep only the words Saorstat Eireann and avoid all awkwardness, that awkwardness that was referred to before arose in the words &ldquo;vested in the State.&rdquo; 
     
     
    
      
       That awkwardness has been avoided in line 47.  It does not arise in line 53. 
     
    
      
       My suggestion is that line 53 ought clearly to refer to the same thing as in line 47. 
     
    
      
       My suggestion is that it does refer to the same thing; that it is the same thing, and that it is so provided for.  It is expressly provided that they are the same thing. 
     
    
      
       Things that are equal to the same thing, I suppose. 
     
    
      
       It should be the &ldquo;Irish Free State/Saorstat Eireann&rdquo; in both places. 
     
    
      
       Will the Minister move an amendment to that effect? 
     
    
      
       I move that in Article 11, line 47&mdash;&ldquo;Irish Free State/ Saorstat Eireann,&rdquo; and in line 53 &ldquo;Irish Free State/Saorstat Eireann.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       I second that. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
     
    
      
       . &ldquo;Amendment 7, page 4, line 1-2&rdquo;&mdash;It should be line 2-3, not line 1-2&mdash;&ldquo;To delete the words `Parliament of the Irish Free State/ Oireachtas' and to substitute the words `the Parliament of the Irish Free State (otherwise called and in these presents generally referred to as the Oireachtas) and to make the consequential amendments throughout the Bill.&rdquo;  The object is to get in the Irish equivalent all through. 
     
    
      
       Would it not be better to say &ldquo;hereafter&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;in these presents&rdquo;?  I do not think we referred to this Statute as though it was a deed in any other place. 
     
    
      
       We expressly struck out the words &ldquo;in these presents&rdquo; in the beginning. 
     
    
      
       &ldquo;Otherwise called or herein generally referred.&rdquo; 
       Amendment agreed to. 
     
    
      
       Amendment No. 8, page 4, line 3&mdash;it should be line 4, not   line 3:&mdash;&ldquo;To delete the words, `Dail Eireann,' and to substitute the words `(otherwise called and in these presents generally referred to as Dail Eireann),' and to make the consequential amendments throughout the Bill.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       &ldquo;Herein&rdquo; again. 
     
    
      
       I second that. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
     
    
      
       Amendment No. 9, page 4, line 5:&mdash;&ldquo;To delete the words Seanad Eireann,' and to substitute the words `(otherwise called and in these presents generally referred to as Seanad Eireann),' and to make the consequential amendments throughout the Bill. 
     
    
      
       &ldquo;And herein generally referred to.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       I second that. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
     
    
      
       In Article 19 there still survives a certain ambiguity.  &ldquo;All reports and publications of the Parliament,&rdquo; of course, clearly intends all official reports.  Otherwise we claim privilege for unauthorised reports which would, perhaps, be thoroughly inaccurate. I suggest it should read &ldquo;all official reports and publications shall be privileged.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       How can a Report be otherwise than official, if it is a report of the Parliament? 
     
    
      
       I suggest that it can still further be emphasised. &ldquo;Wherever published&rdquo; in the last line quite clearly refers to unofficial publications. 
     
    
      
       It seems to me that Deputies noticing these things should give us notice, so that we could wrestle with these particular amendments in time. 
     
    
      
       I think the point raised by Deputy Magennis was considered some time ago.  In fact, it was felt that it was covered by &ldquo;reports and publications of the Parliament.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       It was just because the Law Adviser thought otherwise,   and I thought it was in his hands, that I did not give notice. 
     
    
      
       What is the position about it now? 
     
    
      
       We will accept &ldquo;official.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       &ldquo;All official reports and publications of the Parliament&rdquo;&mdash;proposed by Deputy Magennis, and seconded by the Minister for Home Affairs. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
     
    
      
       Is no amendment admissible, except one that two days' notice has been given of? 
     
    
      
       I think not. 
     
    
      
       Even though it is palpable there is a mistake? 
     
    
      
       Unless it is palpable there is a mistake.  We have taken two already to-day. 
     
    
      
       I would like to suggest, with regard to Article 28, page 6, that there is a slight oversight.  It says:&mdash;&ldquo;At a General Election for the Chamber/Dail Eireann the polls shall be held on the same day throughout the country.&rdquo;  The preceding Article says:&mdash;&ldquo;Each University shall be entitled to elect three representatives to the Dail upon a franchise and in a manner to be prescribed by law.&rdquo;  It is just conceivable that it may not be possible to have a University Election upon the one day. 
     
    
      
       Usually it is not. 
     
    
      
       If it was put in &ldquo;save as regards University Elections.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       It is a matter of substance. 
     
    
      
       It is a matter of substance, because University Elections generally last more than one day, and the law leaves it in the hands of the Returning Officer to fix the day. 
     
    
      
       I think Article 27 settles it all right. 
     
    
      
       In Article 27 the manner to be prescribed by law is subject to 28. 
     
     
    
      
       It would meet it if the Dail would allow the insertion in that clause of a provision similar to that in Article 26&mdash;&ldquo;exclusive of members for the Universities&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;At a General Election for the Chamber/Dail Eireann the polls (exclusive of members for the Universities) shall be held on the same day.&rdquo;  Then the manner to be prescribed by law in Article 27 will make provision for the Universities if it is thought fit to make any difference. 
     
    
      
       Deputy Magennis's amendment, seconded by Deputy Fitzgibbon, in that form is accepted. 
     
    
      
       &ldquo;Exclusive of members for the Universities.&rdquo; 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       The following amendment stood in the name of Mr. Eamon Duggan:&mdash;(a) Article 55.  At the end of the first line, immediately after the word &ldquo;Council,&rdquo; to insert the following:&mdash;&ldquo;may be appointed by the Representative of the Crown from amongst the members of Dail Eireann.  Every such Minister shall&rdquo; 
       (b) To delete the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; at the commencement of the second line. 
     
    
      
       On a point of order, the Standing Order relating to the discussion of the final stage of a Bill is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;When a Bill shall come forward for final consideration it shall be moved `that the Bill do now pass,' and no amendments of the Bill shall be permitted save such as are of a purely verbal character, and of which due notice shall have been given.&rdquo;  I submit that this amendment is an amendment of substance, and not of a purely verbal character.  The words &ldquo;from amongst the members of Dail Eireann&rdquo; distinctly introduce a new principle, and it would give rise to considerable discussion and opposition.  It cannot be considered as purely verbal, and therefore I submit, according to the Standing Order, it is not in order in so far as it trespasses on the mere verbal alteration.  I ask for your ruling. 
     
    
      
       I desire to support Deputy Johnson in asking for your ruling in that direction: I originally   moved the Article as it now stands. You have already discussed this matter in sub-Committee.  The whole of that Committee's recommendations was not adopted by the Dail, but those recommendations included a provision which, if it were here, would make it quite clear that it was then intended that people not members of the Dail may be members.  A provision was even made that the Ministers, including the Executive Council, who were members of the Dail would be a majority.  So if this amendment were moved with the idea that it was calculated to restore what was the mind of the Dail and the intention of the Dail, as I say must be the case, then it was moved under a misapprehension.  When it was before the Dail originally the clear intention&mdash;of the mover at all events&mdash; was that the Article should leave it open to the Dail to decide whom it should have as Ministers from outside.  Obviously what the Deputy proposes is a great deal more than a verbal change. The report of the Committee bears that out. 
     
    
      
       The change is certainly more than a verbal change, unless it can be proved that it merely puts into words what was the clear intention of the Dail.  It is a matter of such importance that it ought to be decided on a different plane. 
     
    
      
       It is a verbal amendment in the same sense as the one you have just accepted, in regard to University Elections. 
     
    
      
       That was by consent. 
     
    
      
       The amendment you have just accepted with regard to University Elections was an amendment with regard to machinery. This is a verbal amendment if it can be proved that it is intended to carry out the intention of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       Members of the Dail know that most of the Ministers favoured the original Executive proposals which involved the selection of Ministers, other than from amongst the members of the Dail.  Therefore, this amendment is not with a view to carrying out any considered opinion or any considered wish of ours, but it is because the whole trend of the discussion   here on the Executive proposals showed that that was the very thing in the Executive proposals that the majority of the members of the Dail objected to, and the fact that they had not explicitly barred selection of Ministers other than from amongst members of the Dail was merely an inadvertance on their part.  There is very little doubt if they had adverted to the fact that they had not entirely closed the door on that process of selection that they would not merely have closed it, but have banged that door.  That was quite clear from the discussion here and the general tenor of the speeches made on the proposals. Facing the fact honestly in consultation amongst ourselves in the Cabinet, we thought it right to put down that amendment, simply to carry out what we well knew to be the wish of the members.  It is entirely now a matter for the members themselves as to whether they will accept it. 
     
    
      
       I would point out so far from that argument as to the will of the Dail having weight, the amendment in question was only carried by a majority of one.  So far as the will of the Dail is concerned that cannot be considered to be a decisive vote, inasmuch as Deputy Magennis pointed out several times that there were two questions involved.  Undoubtedly on the last stage of the discussion on this Bill this question would have been raised and points would have been insisted upon in the course of the discussion and votes would have been taken but for the fact that the form of the Bill, as presented to us, was as it now stands in respect of this Clause.  In view of these circumstances, and in view of the Standing Order, I submit that there is no option but to declare that this is not an amendment of a verbal character, but an amendment of substance, and would raise a new discussion on the principle of whether there should be compulsion or should be any option whatever to the Dail to nominate a man or woman as Minister who is not a member of the Chamber.  The matter is left open. 
     
    
      
       I recollect the circumstances and I claim very distinctly there was a vote against the proposal to have Ministers selected from outside the membership of the Dail, and that was negatived on two occasions by vote.   In the first case it was complicated with a provision that if a member of the Dail were selected as one of those in-and-out Ministers that he was to surrender his seat.  The &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in that clause was withdrawn and then by the Committee of which Deputy Fitzgibbon was Chairman another clause was introduced with what would seem to me at the time limitations.  Undoubtedly the clause as it stands is the form in which it was proposed by Deputy Gavan Duffy &mdash;&ldquo;Ministers who shall not be members of the Executive Council may be nominated by the Chamber.&rdquo;  What helps my recollection of this is that I contested the form of words for quite a long time.  What was really the sense of the Dail, at least, was represented by that slight majority to which Deputy Johnson refers.  The sense was that those non-Executive Council Ministers should not be selected from non-members of Parliament, but I do not think it could be contended that they were to be drawn exclusively from members of Dail Eireann.  Whether or not there was room left for the selection from the Senate I think is rather a difficult question, so that perhaps from that point of view it is more than a case of rectification of an error to introduce these words. 
     
    
      
       Apart from the ambiguity as to whether Ministers might not be selected from the Senate, I think it is agreed that, unless implicitly barred, Ministers may be selected who would be members of neither Seanad nor Dail.  It is right to say that if this particular amendment is not accepted the Bill will probably have to go back to Committee, because there is this point that if Ministers are appointed who are not members of the Dail, it is insisted on the other side that such Ministers shall comply with Article 17 as if they were members of the Dail.  They would not agree to Executive proposals that would involve Ministers from outside the Dail, unless the Dail were to make compliance with Article 17 compulsory on such Ministers.  Therefore, if we do not bar such Ministers by the acceptance of this amendment we will have to send the Bill back to Committee to insert an Article to the effect, that if outside members are selected they shall comply with Article 17. 
     
     
    
      
       The matter is clear enough, but what the Dail actually did was not very clear.  That is the position. 
     
    
      
       Is it Ministers outside the Executive Council or outside the Dail? 
     
    
      
       Outside the Dail. 
     
    
      
       The Dail appointed a committee, and Deputy Professor Magennis pointed out that the resolution about the committee had for its principal sentence: &ldquo;That this House approves of the general principle of the proposal that certain Ministers need not be members of the Dail.&rdquo;  The committee considered that proposal and brought in certain clauses putting that into practice, and the committee's report was rejected, and by people I am quite clear, who believed they were voting against the idea that anybody could be a Minister that was not a member of the Dail.  That was quite clear.  I suppose Deputies turned up specially to vote against any such proposal, and, having voted against it, they went away.  They did not remain for the committee stage to see that none of the things to which they objected would, by any Parliamentary sleight of hand, get into the Constitution, and things did get into the Constitution, and the Constitution as it stands does not coincide with that particular vote of the Dail, rejecting the report of the Select Committee.  This amendment on the paper now is an attempt which might have been made at the last reading, but which is being made now to clear up the position.  The amendment is not in order now as a verbal amendment to the Bill, but you can take it by special leave, and discuss it. 
     
    
      
       Would it be in order to move that special leave be given to take it? 
     
    
      
       I submit that is opposed to the Standing Order.  If there were general agreement to make any amendment that is one thing, but to use a majority to destroy the Standing Orders in face of opposition, just to carry a particular clause which is out of order, according to the Standing Order under which you have been working, I   submit is an abuse of the procedure under which we have been working, and ought not to be allowed.  The Minister has pointed out that there will be need for reference back to a Committee to secure one particular provision.  I do not suppose there will be strong opposition to that.  This matter that is now under discussion is of very great importance. As has been suggested, if you are going to restrict these non-Executive Council members of the Ministry to the Dail, that is an imposition upon members who support the proposition that Senators may be appointed as Ministers. As it stands it is open to the Dail to nominate members of the Senate as Ministers.  If you alter it, as is suggested, that will not be possible, and I submit you have there a very considerable and vital alteration in the form of the Constitution, and it ought not to be altered by a mere misuse of the forms of procedure. 
     
    
      
       The Dail knows that I fought this point somewhat stubbornly before, but owing to circumstances to which there has been reference a certain form of words did get in with which I disagreed.  I am perfectly convinced&mdash;candour compels me to say&mdash; that the circumstances of the time and the decision of the Dail were against me.  A compromise was achieved and a bargain was struck, and although I disagreed with the point made then by Deputy Johnson, I think that bargain should be adhered to and I think the point of order that he has raised is a just one. 
     
    
      
       The point of order is quite just and correct, but there is a very much more important matter than order concerned. 
     
    
      
       If we cannot find some way out it will involve an adjournment of the Dail, with consequent great waste of time, or it might mean a straining of the Standing Orders and a going back to Committee.  That would mean a great waste of time, and it would be better if we could find some means out of the impasse which would be just and which would admit of this matter being adjusted.  It might be more desirable if we agreed to go into Committee, so that any amendment dealing with this particular point, or any alternative   amendment, might be put up.  That would be a way out.  It is a matter of straining the Standing Orders with a view to saving time and getting through the business. 
     
    
      
       I think the suggestion of the Minister is the only one the Dail can really adopt.  If the Ministers think that in the clause as it stands there must be inserted in Committee somewhere or another a reference to Article 17, the Bill will have to go back to Committee for that.  If it is going back to Committee at all, would it not be better for Ministers or somebody else to move to re-commit the Bill now?  It is a matter which must be inherent in the power of the Assembly, to resolve itself into Committee in a matter like this.  In Committee you could have a straight vote on the clause as it stands, or we could make necessary alterations in reference to Clause 17.  On the other hand, if the amendment proposed by Ministers is accepted, there is no need to deal any further with the matter. 
     
    
      
       There is a suggestion that you might, by general agreement or without opposition, concede the point as a Committee matter. That is the point the Minister has raised with regard to the necessity for all Ministers taking the Oath, whether they are appointed from inside or outside.  That is a suggestion which may cause less trouble and less discussion than the recommitting of the clause. 
     
    
      
       We ought not to begin by overriding Standing Orders. 
     
    
      
       This might possibly meet the difficulty.  To insert: &ldquo;Each such Minister shall be appointed by the Representative of the Crown, and shall comply with the provisions of Article 17.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       As far as the new amendment now suggested is concerned, it meets the real vital issue of the case. It would have to be by general agreement. I would say that Deputy Johnson's point is a very good one.  The fact that the opportunity was not availed of by these very energetic Deputies who did not agree with the Article as originally framed&mdash;the fact that they did not rectify the infirmities of that Article as subsequently submitted and adopted is   certainly a point that we would scarcely contest with Deputy Johnson.  This particular amendment would meet the case if it is generally agreed upon.  It gets in what has come to be a vital issue in this matter.  We all admit that no Minister would get any advantage or derive any advantage that the members of the Executive Council did not derive or possess; that is that a Minister should not be excluded from the obligations of Article 17 or from the other obligation of being appointed by the representatives of the Crown.  That was not our intention, but it was so construed and it was incorrectly interpreted.  If this amendment be accepted it will meet the case and it will also meet Deputy Johnson's point.  Certain members had very particular objection to what are called extern Ministers and they were unable to rectify the Article at the time when they should have rectified it. 
     
    
      
       The withdrawal of the amendment meets my main objection. The proposal of the new amendment opens another question. 
     
    
      
       Deputies who were very enthusiastic over a particular thing were possessed of an enthusiasm which did not last sufficiently long to carry their opinions to their proper conclusion. 
     
    
      
       Some of them. 
     
    
      
       Yes; some of them, and it was pointed out in the Committee stage that it was not anybody's business except the business of the members of the Dail to decide what form a clause should take. 
     
    
      
       So far as the withdrawal of the amendment goes, I am delighted.  So far as the other amendment goes, the difficulty, I feel, is this.  Ministers take the view that this Article 17 must be applied to every future Minister under the Constitution. I venture to differ on the ground, that I see nothing whatever from beginning to end of the Treaty that could prescribe any such thing.  Article 17, following Article 4, must apply to Members of Parliament, but where do they get the theory from, that it must apply to other people?  If I am alone in taking this objection, I should not feel myself justified   in holding up the Bill.  On the other hand, I do not want to be taken as assenting to what I consider a very strange view.  I dissented from a sub-committee on this very same question. I suggest that the thing go through as it stands now, that British Ministers have no right to impose any fancy view of their own upon it.  The Treaty speaks. for itself&mdash;is there or is there not any definite ground which makes Ministers. think that there will be trouble about this thing in London, I mean trouble caused by a legitimate claim by the other side?  Viewing the thing, as the words are written in the Treaty, I fail to see where the difficulty can come in. Therefore, if I am the only one to take this objection, I do not want to hold the matter up, but I strongly protest against the insertion of unnecessary words, because forsooth the English beyond may ask questions when this Constitution is through. 
     
    
      
       The amendments 10A and 10B are both withdrawn by Deputy Duggan by leave of the Dail, and in order to get over the difficulty which has arisen, it is suggested that another amendment, not subject to the objections already raised with respect to amendment 10A, shall be proposed. 
       Amendment proposed: &ldquo;At the end of the first line, immediately after the word `Council' to insert the following: `May be appointed by the representative of the Crown and shall comply with the provisions of Article 17 and every such Minister shall.' &rdquo; 
     
    
      
       On a point of order, you yourself a few moments ago recited the history of the transaction, and as I understood you, you declared the majority vote had been against the admission of Ministers who were not elected members of this Dail. Now; on a former occasion, with regard to the report of Deputy Fitzgibbon's Committee, the Chief Whip of the Ministerial Party reminded us of a regulation by which a matter decided cannot be brought up again within six months.  Consequently, this point has been decided, that Ministers are not to be nominated who are not members of the Dail.  The present amendment reverses this; consequently, I suggest to you, very much against my own grain, that it is out of order. 
     
     
    
      
       A very excellent suggestion, but I do not agree with it. 
     
    
      
       The Deputy is altogether wrong. 
     
    
      
       The Deputy must take it that the clauses here in the Bill represent the decisions of the Dail.  Article 55 is a decision of the Dail, and we are not reversing it by this amendment. 
       Article 55, as amended, read:&mdash;&ldquo;Ministers who shall not be members of the Executive Council, may be appointed by the representative of the Crown, and shall comply with the provisions of Article 17.  Every such Minister shall be nominated by the Chamber/Dail Eireann on the recommendation of a Committee of the Chamber/Dail Eireann chosen by a method to be determined by the Chamber/Dail Eireann, so as to be impartially representative of the Chamber/ Dail Eireann.  Should a recommendation not be acceptable to the Chamber/Dail Eireann, the Committee may continue to recommend names until one is found acceptable. The total number of Ministers including the Ministers of the Executive Council shall not exceed twelve.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       I want to have this thing clear.  A vote was taken approving of a certain principle.  The carrying out of that principle was referred to a sub-committee.  The decision of that committee on that principle was turned down, and, acting on the voice of the Dail, the Article was agreed to. &ldquo;Ministers who shall not be members of the Executive Council&rdquo;&mdash;we took it that Ministers appointed outside the Executive Council would still be members of this Dail, and not from outside this Dail, and I want to have that made clear. 
     
    
      
       To answer Deputy Gorey's point&mdash;the situation, as we understand it, is this: That the Constitution came down from the Ministry, with the term &ldquo;shall appoint&rdquo; Ministers, either from outside the Dail, or members of the Dail, and who shall subsequently retire from membership.  That was referred to a committee with a general approval of that form.  That approval came back.  The report of the committee was not adopted, but the   Dail did not go further.  The Dail did not say, &ldquo;every such Minister shall be a member of the Dail,&rdquo; and that is the position as it stands, and is not altered by this amendment. 
     
    
      
       It was stated that no Ministers could be appointed, except they were members of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       The decision of the Dail on Article 55 is in print before you, and every Deputy had as much opportunity as every other Deputy of examining every word, every full stop, and every comma therein.  What the Ministers said about it is not relevant. The point is that no new principle is being introduced by the amendment brought before the Dail. 
     
    
      
       He will be as much and as little an appointment by the Representative of the Crown as the Ministers who will be members of the Executive Council. 
     
    
      
       Are we to understand now that he can go outside the members of the Dail?  I do not think he can. 
     
    
      
       What Deputy Gorey has in his mind is whether the Committee will be left to nominate them. 
     
    
      
       Yes. 
     
    
      
       And you go outside the Dail?&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       Yes.  I am sorry for interrupting so often, but it is right that at this last stage members should be thoroughly acquainted with the provisions of the Constitution as they stand. It is possible for a person outside to come in, but it is not mandatory on the Dail to elect such persons, and the body to elect such person will be the Committee that will be the least common multiple of this Dail.  That Committee will be from this Dail and will nominate persons inside, but I do not think that will be done in this Dail or the next, but may be at a future time.  They are not prevented from nominating persons from outside. 
     
    
      
       I am quite satisfied, because the vote taken here the other day   was an insult to the Dail, because the proposition was that the Dail should do a certain thing and a vote was passed saying that it should not.  It was a vote of censure on the Dail itself, saying that the Dail was to be prevented from accepting a privilege; that, in fact, they did not believe they could carry it out. 
     
    
      
       The effect of the amendment before us is that it does two things, one of which renders the other unnecessary.  The appointment by the Governor-General of Ministers is obviously necessary according to the Constitutional practice of the Dominion of Canada, but if you expressly state that these outside Ministers are to be so appointed you render it unnecessary to have Article 17, because the gentleman who has to appoint them will refuse to do so unless they comply with that Article.  We can get away from that contentious subject if Ministers will leave it at that. 
     
    
      
       I do not agree that it is preferable to the amendment to create a position in which that personage will exercise any real power or any real veto.  What Deputy Gavan Duffy proposes is that we should create a situation in which the Governor-General should refuse to appoint Ministers who are nominated and put to him by a representative Committee of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       No; I must have misconveyed myself.  He cannot act on anybody else's advice but on that of the Executive Council. 
     
    
      
       Yes; the drift of what Deputy Gavan Duffy said, and I use the word &ldquo;drift&rdquo; advisedly, is likely to create a position in which his appointment of persons nominated by the Dail would not be automatic.  Because he could say &ldquo;you have not complied with Article 17.&rdquo;  That is creating a crux and a difficulty, and we do not accept that as sound criticism of the amendment. 
       The substituted amendment was put and agreed to. 
     
    
      
       I beg to move as an amendment:&mdash; 
     
     &ldquo;Article 74.  To alter paragraph 2 so as to read:&mdash;`Goods transported during   the said current financial year from or to the Irish Free State, to or from any part of Great Britain or the Isle of Man or any part of Ireland which may be outside the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State, shall not, except so far as the Executive Council may otherwise direct, in respect of the forms to be used and the information to be furnished, be treated as goods exported or imported, as the case may be.&rdquo; 
     This is a verbal alteration.  If it is ruled to be other than a verbal alteration I cannot press it, but it seems to me that to use the words &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; in this clause is not the intention of the Minister, inasmuch as the Constitution itself has created a relationship between Ireland and Great Britain which nullifies that term, and consequently it could not be intended that the words &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; should remain.  The suggestion is that the paragraph should be altered to &ldquo;Goods transported during the current financial year to or from the Irish Free State, to or from any part of Great Britain or the Isle of Man, shall not, except so far as the Executive Council may otherwise direct in respect of the forms to be used and the information to be furnished, be treated as goods exported or imported, as the case may be.&rdquo;  There is a suggestion, which I accept, to leave out the words &ldquo;any other part of Ireland which may be outside the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  It may meet the situation and may be a better form to say &ldquo;From any part of Great Britain, Ireland or the Isle of Man, leaving out the words &ldquo;Or any part of Ireland which may be outside the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  If we say &ldquo;Ireland, Great Britain, or the Isle of Man,&rdquo; that may be satisfactory to Ministers and convey the same idea without using the words &ldquo;United Kingdom,&rdquo; which is a misnomer. 
    
      
       I beg to second the amendment. 
     
    
      
       &ldquo;That part of the amendment `or any part of Ireland which may be outside the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State' goes out and we will accept the other part.&rdquo; 
     
     Amendment that the second paragraph of Article 74 shall be as follows:&mdash; &ldquo;Goods transported during the said current financial years from or to the Irish Free State, to or from any part of Great Britain or the Isle of Man shall not, except so far as the Executive Council may otherwise direct, in respect of the forms to be used and the information to be furnished, be treated as goods exported or imported as the case may be.&rdquo; 
     Put and agreed to. 
    
      
       I want to suggest a slight alteration in Article 38, to leave out in line nine the words &ldquo;be deemed to be&rdquo; and to substitute for them the words &ldquo;in the form in which it was last&rdquo; and in the next line to omit the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; and to substitute the word &ldquo;every.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       I beg to second the amendment. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
     
    
      
       In Article 11, line 55, as it stands in the draft, I beg to move that after &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; the words &ldquo;disposed of&rdquo; be inserted before &ldquo;controlled.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       I second that. 
     
    
      
       I submit as far as I can read it that that is not a verbal alteration.  Now, the words &ldquo;disposed of&rdquo; wipe away the whole purport of the clause in my opinion. 
     
    
      
       If there is any objection I do not press it. 
     
    
      
       How could you administer a lease if you could not dispose of it? 
     
    
      
       I suggest that the words &ldquo;disposed of&rdquo; do not affect the matter very much.  I think that when a prohibition against total alienation is so complete as it is in the latter part of the clause&mdash;I do not think Deputy Johnson need fear that the introduction of the words &ldquo;disposed of&rdquo; higher up would give Ministers any greater power than they already possess in the word &ldquo;administer.&rdquo;  I don't think that the words &ldquo;disposed of&rdquo; is absolutely necessary, but it cannot do any harm. 
     
    
      
       I am not very confident of my reading of this, which is sprung upon us, but I am afraid it might mean more than it appears on the   surface.  If Deputy Fitzgibbon's reading is correct, then the Minister need not press his point.  I would urge that it be not pressed. 
     
    
      
       I am not pressing it. Amendment withdrawn. 
     
    
      
       In Article 21 I move the insertion in line 11, after the word &ldquo;duties,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;remuneration.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       I was going to suggest that that was originally intended by the words &ldquo;terms of office.&rdquo; 
       The Article as amended was agreed to. 
     
    
      
       There are no more verbal amendments to be moved to the Bill, and very little has been said in the course of the discussion on this last reading which calls for comment. It is right to say that we are satisfied that whatever Government emerges from the present break-up in English politics that the Treaty and all honourable implications of the Treaty will be observed and adhered to.  We have no misgivings on that point, and we do not think that anyone else need have misgivings on that point.  If we were asked to suppose the unthinkable, and to suppose that attempts would be made by a future Government in England to tamper with the Treaty, or anything that flows naturally or honourably from the Treaty, then our attitude in such a condition of things would be quite simple.  There will be nothing complex about it; and certain little fishes who have been straining themselves to talk like whales since last December might have an opportunity of showing their form.  One thing more: we have no other policy for the North-East of Ireland than we have for the rest of Ireland.  We have no policy but the Treaty policy, and we are going ahead with that.  This Constitution has been framed for all Ireland, and it is a Constitution under which all Irishmen can live in peace and charity with their neighbours, and we wish for nothing more heartily than that&mdash;to all Irishmen, whether they be from the extreme North or the extreme South or the North-East or South-West, if the Northern Parliament decides to opt out from the jurisdiction of the Free State, then they must take the very natural and logical consequences of that; and we have nothing to stand on except upon our Treaty rights. 
     
     
    
      
       The motion now is that the Constitution of the Saorstat Eireann Bill as amended on Report be passed. Motion agreed to. 
     
    
      
       An official Irish version has been prepared and revised by a Committee of which the Minister for Education is Chairman and Dr. Osborne Bergin, Deputy P. Beaslai, Deputy Padraig O'Maille, Liam O'Rinn and the Clerk were members.  That will be printed with the final Bill.  It is necessary to get the assent of the Dail to this Irish version as the official version. I ask the sanction of the Dail for this. 
     
    
      
       I move that the sanction of the Dail be given for that official version. 
     
    
      
       That is agreed to. 
     
    
      
       I wish to know in what form it will be published. I hope the Constitution now prescribed may be emancipated from this colour (indicating the Copy of the Constitution of Saorstat Eireann Bill). 
     
    
      
       It is a good colour for the eyes. 
     
    
      
       The colour passes into white when the Bill is enacted. 
     
    
      
       I have one further suggestion following a different suggestion I made to the Minister for Home Affairs, which I understood he agreed to.  Would it be possible in the public version, for the sake of clarification, to print the title in brackets?  I suggest that for the purpose of simplication the Bill should be sub-divided, without necessarily having the title forming part of the Bill. 
     
    
      
       It will be necessary to print the Act as it left the Dail, but for other purposes it may be printed by the Government with perhaps that or other suggestions carried out, with sub-headings. 
     
   
   
     NOMINATIONS FOR THE SENATE. - MOTION BY THE PRESIDENT. 
    
      
       In Article 82 of the Treaty particulars are set down as   to how the first Senate shall be constituted, and that practically follows out the agreement which was entered into by the late President Griffith and the representatives of the Southern Unionists. Now, this resolution was one which the late Mr. Griffith undertook to move at the Session or meeting of Parliament which would adopt this Constitution.  It is:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;That it is expedient that the President of the Executive Council, in nominating the nominated members of the Senate, should, with a view to the providing of representation for groups of all parties not adequately represented in the Chamber, consult with representative persons and bodies, including the following:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;Chamber of Commerce, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Benchers of the Honourable Society of King's Inns, Dublin, the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, Councils of the County Boroughs of the Irish Free State.&rdquo; 
       We have agreed as far as the Ministry is concerned, and I think most members of the Dail to whom I have spoken agree, that the contract entered into by President Griffith should be kept by us. It was a fair bargain to satisfy those who thought they were being at least politically excluded from having any part or control or co-operation in the Government of the country.  It has been put to us by representatives of these men that although their points of view differ from us in many things they can bring to bear on matters which are of great public concern a line of thought that we are unacquainted with.  If by including such an order in the Oireachtas, goodwill may be established between all sections of the community, and that we can bring home to these people the fact that we are prepared to work with them for the good of the country, I think that very much good may be accomplished by reason of that fact.  For a generation people who are mainly concerned in this proposal have been divorced from close association with the people, and it is hoped to bring them into close association and to get the benefit out of their co-operation in that direction.  I formally move the motion. 
     
    
      
       I second. 
     
     
    
      
       There is just a point that arises in connection with this proposal.  I am not opposing it, but I think it well to draw attention to the wisdom of consulting not only these particular societies but other organisations that are entitled to be consulted, representing the Northern parts of Ireland. It seems to me that it would be desirable to take advantage of the opportunity to invite representation from that part of Ireland which has not been represented here, on to the Senate, and that representative people from the North-East corner&mdash;the Six Counties&mdash; whether nominated by Chambers of Commerce or the Royal College of Physicians or the College of Surgeons or other societies, or perhaps even by the Trades Council of Belfast or of Derry, may well be brought into consultation, and consider whether they might be prepared to nominate (or consent to be nominated by the President) persons representing labour interests in that part of Ireland.  It is within the competence, as I read the Constitution, to make Senators of men or women from that part of the country, who would be prepared to act and show that there is a unity despite the possible dissension of the majority, that there is a unity with the rest of the country in the minds at least of a very large section of the residents in the Northern part of Ireland.  I would urge upon the President that when he is consulting these various bodies that he should bear in mind, and ask them to bear in mind, the wisdom of nominating representatives who live and move and have their being in that part of the country called Northern Ireland. 
     
    
      
       As a Representative of the National University it is, I fear, incumbent upon me to obtrude myself&mdash;though just for a few minutes at most&mdash;into the consideration of this matter.  It was, I think, on the 18th September last that the President of An Dail either read to us or circulated a copy of that compact which the late President Arthur Griffith and the present Minister for Home Affairs of the one part, entered into with certain representatives of Southern Unionists of the other part. Now in that document, which I studied very carefully, and I have read more than once in the interval, it is stated that   the representation to which the present motion of the President of An Dail refers as representation for all parties not adequately represented in the Chamber, was to be a representation for the minority party, a representation, that is, for what was formerly known as the Southern Unionists.  Many of them, we know, repudiate that description now, and would regard it as offensive to apply it to them, but inasmuch as it is a term used in that minor Treaty it might be more convenient&mdash;and I protest my intention is not to be offensive in any sense&mdash;to continue to use the term.  In that agreement representation was to be secured in some fashion in the Senate for certain bodies the political complexion of which was understood to be describable by the term Southern Unionist. Now amongst the bodies to be consulted for the purpose of securing this minority representation in the Senate, which otherwise could not be secured in An Dail, a certain number of bodies were set out as to be consulted, and they are set out here again.  There was, as I read it, a danger that once the nominees were elected to the Senate, that they might be thought to take their places there by virtue of some professional pre-eminence, and that the political origin of their being specially nominated might be lost sight of as historical fact.  You can easily see what the consequences of that might be as regards other professional bodies&mdash;I hasten to say, before I develop my point, that I congratulate the President on the mode in which he has obviated, so far, I think, as words can go to obviate, the possibility of any such misunderstanding, and it is merely to put it on record on behalf of the National University of Ireland, that I am now speaking on the matter&mdash;there was, I say, reason to fear that when representatives chosen, say, on the recommendation of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland should take their seats in the Senate, that the public would look up to these as being the men of mark in the Medical Profession, selected because they were outstanding men in the Medical Profession, and then it would appear as if medical men, graduates of the National University, for example, occupied some species of inferior status to those other men whom the late President and others desired to do honour   to, although our graduates are men who deserve well of their country.  I think it therefore incumbent on me, even at the risk of being wearisome and tedious, to impress upon the Dail this fact that in the present motion of the President it is declared &ldquo;that it is expedient to consult with representative persons and bodies, including the following.&rdquo; This consultation is not limited to these bodies; I take it there is implied in this an undertaking to consult with other representative bodies as well.  Now, the bodies mentioned are the Chambers of Commerce; they, of course, would be able to inform the President of An Dail as to who in their bodies are men of eminence in business and commercial circles, who by reason of their political predilections would possibly not find favour with the electorate.  I take it that the Chambers of Commerce are intended to give light and counsel with regard to commercial and industrial Unionists. Now we come to the Benchers of the Honourable Society of the King's Inns, Dublin.  That body, I think&mdash;I speak subject to the correction of Deputy Fitzgibbon&mdash;along with the Bar Council of Ireland, represents the barristers&mdash;the principal branch of the Legal Profession in Ireland&mdash;and here again, if members eligible for nomination to the Senate are recommended by this body, it will, of course, again be under the compact with the late President Griffith because they are Southern Unionists, and not because they are the most distinguished lawyers in the country.  And then again, the next body to be consulted is the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, and that undoubtedly is the official body associated with the solicitors' profession &mdash;the other branch of the Legal Profession in Ireland; and once more it is necessary to bear in mind that when that body recommends candidates for election to the Senate it is because the recommending body regards them as Southern Unionists who require this assistance to bring them into the new Parliament of Ireland.  These recommendations are all because of the pact made by President Griffith.  Now, I would not have spoken at such length only that I believe it was most necessary to have it impressed upon the Dail that when the President put into the present motion the words, &ldquo;including the following,&rdquo; he is divesting the original document   embodying the pact of a great-deal of what to us, in the National University, was highly objectionable because, if you bear this in mind, the College of Physicians of Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, form a conjoint body, for conferring medical degrees, or rather licences to practise.  They represent one licencing body; Trinity College, or Dublin University represents another.  The National University, which has three medical schools&mdash;one an exceptionally large and important medical school in Dublin, another in Cork, and another in Galway&mdash; represents a third.  Now here is a licencing body,  pari passu  with the licencing body mentioned in the pact, and I do not intend, and hope I shall not be taken as intending, even in the remotest way to suggest any reflection on the body named here.  It is merely to secure equality and to obviate any possible misunderstanding with regard to the result that shall be attained by the President when the recommendations of these bodies come up with the list of their nominees. 
     
    
      
       I welcome the determination of the Ministers to consult Commerce, Science, and the Law, and I presume they will also consult the Engineers and other eminent Societies, but in consulting these bodies I would wish the Minister to assure me, or to assure himself rather, that there is some reformation in the mode of election to Fellows of these Colleges.  Now, the first College on the list is the College of Physicians.  I have been told by very eminent physicians in the City of Dublin, men who have worked for a very considerable number of years, worked practically all their lives and stand at the head of their profession, that it is next door to impossible to be elected to a Fellowship to the College of Physicians if they do not wear the cloak of the University of Dublin, of Trinity College; while at the same time men of practically no experience, or of a few years' standing, no eminence whatsoever, will be pitchforked into it if they have the appendage of Trinity College.  Now if such is the case, if I have been rightly informed that such is the case, I hope the Minister will bring pressure to bear on these Colleges&mdash;the College of Physicians in particular has been instanced. and I suppose the same thing holds good   with the College of Surgeons&mdash;that there will be reformation in the mode of election of the governing body of these Colleges. 
     
    
      
       I suppose, Sir, it is incumbent on me to say something, as I have been President of the College of Physicians for the last three years.  I deprecate, perhaps more than anyone, the introduction of the question of religion into this matter, but perhaps as I am driven&mdash;&mdash; 
     
    
      
       Might I remind the Deputy that the question of religion was not introduced, unless he may be wanting to introduce it himself. 
     
    
      
       I am extremely sorry.  His remarks then have no meaning and there is no necessity for me to discuss them. 
     
    
      
       I would like, A Chinn Comhairle, just to say one sentence; it may help to disabuse the Deputy's mind.  As a Fellow of Trinity College this is the first time that I ever heard it put forward by anybody that the Royal College of Physicians was in any respect an appendage of Trinity College, Dublin, and I think that members of the Royal College of Physicians would not be satisfied with the suggestion that it was. 
     
    
      
       May I say that the College of Physicians had no knowledge of this request, nor did they ask to be consulted. 
     
    
      
       There has been a good deal of talk about having consulted the College of Surgeons and the College of Physicians instead of some other body. We have eight doctors at present in the Dail.  I think whatever the other Body is, the College of Physicians and the College of Surgeons are very well represented here.  Possibly there are some representatives of the College of Physicians and the College of Surgeons amongst these eight doctors.  I believe there are two or three members, perhaps more, but that is not the point.  There is no imputation either upon the bodies included or the bodies excluded.  The real idea, I think, in the minds of those who put up that proposition was that it is from such Institutions as those mentioned that you would get representation that was not then in the Dail.  Possibly   now after the Elections a different set of propositions would have been put up, but at that time those were the bodies from whom the representatives of what were called Southern Unionists thought they would get that leavening.  We all know that the late Dail was exclusively a political body.  Politics were the whole substance out of which it was composed.  Now this Dail is not so constituted. We have very respectable orders of the community&mdash;Labour, Farmers, Doctors and Universities.  I know, too, one gentleman who sought to impress upon myself and other Ministers the rights of women.  I think he was responsible for the exclusion of a lady from this Dail.  I am not sure, but I think so. 
     
    
      
       You do not refer to me? 
     
    
      
       However, that is the case we are putting up with regard to this Seanad.  We hope this Seanad will be a success.  It will be very largely responsible for the success of the Oireachtas.  If bad feeling should be raised between the two Houses, then the Seanad will be of no use.  If good feeling, goodwill and co-operation are the result of the relations between the two Houses, then I think there is little doubt that they will be a success.  It is for that we hope, and in order to bring that about I am utterly indifferent as to the type or style of individual that will be in that House.  I note what Deputy Johnson says about bringing in somebody from the North, but he will observe it is from groups not adequately represented in the House it is proposed to select.  If, for example, the North were to accept that co-operation and that good feeling that I believe every single member of this Dail entertains towards the North, I am satisfied that you would have both a different Dail here and a different Seanad.  But if that be not the case, do we serve any useful purpose in bringing in those Deputy Johnson desires&mdash;I mean that particular order?  What will happen here, to my mind, is this, if the Oireachtas of the Free State be run on the basis which I believe is the intention and the hope of every member of this Dail, the days of the North keeping out are very few and we will live to see them coming in, and coming in in that way&mdash;impressed with the solid work we   are carrying on&mdash;will be the best way to get them in. 
       Motion agreed. 
     
    
      
       I would like to ask the Dail to adjourn for a week.  There are quite a number of matters that I have spoken of here at question time under consideration.  When the Dail sits from three until eight o'clock it will be readily understood that there is very little time to discuss those matters.  We have such things as the election of 30 members, and preparations for that would occupy the attention of the Minister for Local Government.  There is the question of compensation which I am dealing with now, and even sometimes on Sunday, and sometimes very late at night.  It is not really getting the attention we would like to give it.  There is also the Franchise Bill and several other matters I cannot remember now.  I do not think it would be reasonably possible for us to put up propositions which would save time here unless we get a week or so to prepare them.  I propose, with the consent of the Dail, an adjournment until this day week at three o'clock. 
     
    
      
       I second that. 
     
    
      
       Before the Dail adjourns I would like to know what steps have been taken to appoint Committees to go into the cost of living?  Have any steps been taken to appoint these Committees? 
     
    
      
       I think I may inform my colleague that at least certain steps, to my knowledge, are being taken   with regard to the appointment of a Central Committee, and I presume also with regard to the appointment of local committees, when the time arrives.  I have that assurance from the Minister responsible. 
     
    
      
       The Minister informed me he had seen 28 people this evening since he came here at three o'clock.  I presume he is seeing other people now.  Does that assurance satisfy the Deputy? 
     
    
      
       Oh, yes; as long as the matter is not being forgotten. 
     
    
      
       The matter has not been forgotten. 
     
    
      
       Is it possible to get a hint of the business that may be before the Dail when it meets? 
     
    
      
       I will endeavour to have the Order circulated on Monday, if possible, but on Tuesday morning at latest. 
     
    
      
       I would like to draw attention to the fact that we in our Standing Orders adopted a certain Committee in Procedure, but nothing was done in that because of the pressure of business.  You may give that your attention in the meantime. 
       Motion made and question put: &ldquo;That the Dail do now adjourn to Wednesday, November 1st.&rdquo; 
       Agreed. 
       The Dail adjourned.
