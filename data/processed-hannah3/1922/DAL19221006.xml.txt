     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - SHORTAGE OF WORKING-CLASS HOUSES. 
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Local Government if he has given consideration to the deplorable conditions existing in many provincial towns as a result of the acute shortage of working-class houses, and, if so, when he proposes to introduce legislation, even of a temporary nature, for the alleviation of a state of affairs which is becoming a menace to the general community. 
     
    
      
       The condition of housing in towns was one of the first matters dealt with by the Provisional Government, who made available a State grant of £1,000,000 for the current financial year; the details of the scheme were announced on the 16th March last. The Government's proposals have been adopted by the great majority of the municipal authorities (77 out of 94), but the carrying out of the programme has been somewhat hindered by the disturbed state of the country, by the difficulty of obtaining suitable sites on reasonable terms, and the hesitancy of contractors to tender on moderate lines.  Every effort, however, has been made to help schemes forward by sending Inspectors to the towns to confer with local authorities, to urge progress, and to advise regarding sites, and the selection of suitable house designs. 
       The local authorities are fully occupied with their present schemes, and there is no need for any emergency legislation at the moment. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS. - ARREST OF A STATIONMASTER. 
     
    
      
       To ask the Minister for Defence if he is aware that the Stationmaster at Palace East, Co. Wexford (Mr. P.J. Holden), was arrested by Free State troops on 11th September, and has since been detained in New Ross Barracks and in Wexford, without charge or trial, and if he is prepared to put this man on trial, or alternately, release him, seeing that he is the sole support of his mother and sister; also to ask the Minister if he is aware that, in the search of Mr. Holden's house a sum of £6 belonging to the mother of Mr. Holden is alleged to have been taken; that the matter was reported to the officer in charge of the troops who effected the arrest; that the money has not yet been returned; and whether he will give instructions for an immediate and searching inquiry into this alleged irregularity on the part of the troops. 
     
    
      
       I would ask the Deputy to postpone this question.  I am not in a position to give an answer to it now.  I hope to do so on Tuesday. 
     
    
      
       It will go down on the paper for Tuesday again. 
     
   
   
     ORDER OF BUSINESS. 
    
      
       I think it would be necessary to ask for the time of the Dail to-day in so far as the two items on the Agenda are concerned,  i.e. , the motion by the Minister for Local Government and the motion by the Minister for Finance.  They may occupy more than the time allotted, and I ask for the permission of the Dail accordingly to take them&mdash;to allow them precedence. 
     
    
      
       Is it suggested that we should take Deputy Thrift's motion after these questions have been disposed of? 
     
    
      
       Yes; I think so. 
     
    
      
       On a point of order would not Deputy Thrift's motion come on as the first business? 
     
    
      
       I am willing; I do not mind. 
     
    
      
       The point is that we have to go into committee for Professor Thrift's motion, and go out of it again for motions 2 and 3 on the Agenda. 
     
     
    
      
       We are hardly likely to get through.  I suggest that it would facilitate the latter discussion on the Constitution of Saorstat Eireann Bill if we could get through Deputy Thrift's motion.  The other propositions may entail long discussions, and we may not get through them to-day. Whereas in the meantime if the Saorstat Eireann Bill were passed, the Committee, as suggested, may be at work before the meeting on Tuesday next. 
     
    
      
       It is essential to dispose of Professor Thrift's motion to-day for the purpose of the Committee on the Constitution Bill. 
     
    
      
       Well, then we will go into Committee and deal with that first. 
     
   
   
     DAIL IN COMMITTEE. 
    
      
       The Dail is in Committee to continue the adjourned debate on Deputy Thrift's motion, put forward by special leave of the Dail.  I think we should have a time limit for this particular motion.  We should be able to dispose of it in a fixed time. 
     
    
      
       I do not think we ought to have anything in the nature of a closure on such an important portion of the Constitution. 
     
    
      
       Very good. 
     
    
      
       I am very emphatically opposed to the adoption of the principle that underlies this resolution. I am opposed to it on two grounds. First of all, because I think it opens up a big door to intriguing political adventurers into the very centre, the very  sanctum sanctorum  of the National Government, and secondly, because I think it presumes to dictate to the Irish people who their governors or rulers shall be.  In considering measures of this kind it is necessary to look, not only to their uses, but also to their possible abuses. We are informed that this measure is to be considered in conjunction with the possible future establishment of Vocational Councils.  If the Government is prepared to bring in a scheme that will enable those Ministers to reach their exalted position by means of the democratic exercise of the franchise, by specific   Vocational groups, I will be in favour of this motion.  But we have been already told by one of the Ministers that, for the present, this policy of Vocational Councils is merely to be considered as something in the nature of pious aspirations. As long as that state of affairs continues I think that those Ministers in external association with the Government should also be left in the same state of suspended animation.  The shelving of the Vocational Council idea in my opinion&mdash;and that shelving is apparently definite&mdash;takes away from those Ministers all democratic sanction.  And I will not permit the people's rights in this matter to be infringed on in the interest of any political experiment, without opposition.  It may be said that there is domocratic sanction behind those Ministers in this respect that they are to be elected by the Dail, and the Dail is elected by the people.  But we all know very well that the Dail is controlled by a majority, and that majority is controlled by the Ministry.  And in actual fact the Ministers in established Governments are nearly always controlled by one dominating personality. That personality may be inside the Dail or outside of the Dail.  He may be in the Cabinet, or he may be that masterful character, known as the big political &ldquo;boss,&rdquo; an individual who holds no political views himself, silent, reserved, keeping all the time in the background, perhaps unknown to the general public, but all the time skilfully manipulating the political switchboard which controls the destiny of the Nation.  Again, it may not be such a man.  It may be the big publicity magnate, the Lord Northcliffe, or the William Randolp Hearst, who is able to put parties in and out of power at his pleasure.  Or, again, it may be the big business trust, the Head or Controller of the big business trust who has all political parties in his pocket.  Practically all the Governments of the world at the present day are controlled by a few individuals of this kind. So far, I do not think that being has appeared on the political horizon in Ireland, but even of that none of us can be certain.  At all events, there can be no doubt we have plenty of the raw material from which such beings are developed here in Ireland, and the process of developing may be going on here in the Dail, and out of the Dail, without our   suspecting it.  This individual, he may be an individual, perhaps it may be a political clique who will have in reality the power of selecting these Ministers. This individual, like all the rest of us, will be quite human.  He will have weaknesses, and there will be cunning and unscrupulous adventurers playing on those weaknesses in order to get themselves into positions and places of privilege in the Cabinet.  He will also have his passions and prejudices, and he will gratify, perhaps, those passions and prejudices by placing those men&mdash;his own men&mdash;in these positions, perhaps in defiance of the people's wishes, and the people will have no redress short of actual revolution.  You may say the people themselves may not be the best to select their rulers; but at all events we must, in justice to the Irish people, say there is some level of competency and decency beneath which a man cannot fall in this country and expect to get the endorsement of his fellow-countrymen at the polls. But there is no level or depth of depravity or degradation to which a man may fall and still not hope to be pitchforked into this high position of power in the Government through the perverted use of this insidious instrument.  In any case, we have no right to curtail the people's liberty&mdash;their inherent liberty&mdash;in a matter of this kind merely because some of us believe the people will not make as good use of that liberty as we would if we were permitted to usurp their prerogative. It was a very wise statesman who said, &ldquo;You may fool some of the people all the time, and all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.&rdquo;  The people may not be always an invaluable bulwark or safeguard against corruption and treachery in high places, but in any case they are the best safeguard that can be got to see that corruption and treachery in high places are not long continued.  At the present time we are engaged in Ireland in the throes of what is, I suppose, the cruellest, most heartrending struggle that has divided this unhappy country, at least in modern history.  In this very Dail we have a very touching example of the bitter trials that individuals are forced to undergo as a result of this conflict. It is only the consciousness that in doing so we are asserting the fundamental principle of our national life that enables us to go against the grain in the   way we are going in fighting this conflict. And what is the principle for which this struggle is being fought?  Briefly that principle might be stated to be this, that no man has the right to exalt himself above his fellows and say &ldquo;I am right; the people are wrong.  The people have no right to go wrong, they must follow me.&rdquo;  Yet in substance that is the policy that underlies this principle, although perhaps in a different garb. The people will elect the wrong people. The Government think the people have no right to go wrong.  Therefore we must deprive the people of the right to elect their rulers, and select them for ourselves.  The people did not relish that doctrine when it was enunciated by ex-President de Valera, and I think we ought to make very sure that the people will take it more kindly when it is put into practice by us. 
     
    
      
       I am quite opposed to the proposition of appointing Ministers who are not members of the Dail.  What is really the proposition? The proposition is to appoint to the function of Ministers super-Chief Clerks. You dismiss them for exactly the same reason as you dismiss the Clerk, but the Chief Clerks whom you propose to clothe with the garb of Ministers are of a very dangerous type, for those men, trained in all the wiles and all the arts of the politician, will, if they think fit, oppose, and very strenuously oppose, any proposition of this Dail which does not find favour in their sight.  In the process of time and through the usual evolution of hero worship, to which this Nation is rather prone, you will arrive at a state something approaching to that of the Venetian Oligarchy.  You had Councils of twelve and a Council of 100 in Venice. Venice rose to the height of her glory under some of those Councils but the Councils ultimately dragged her down. This proposition, I believe, will not prove good for the country; it will not be acceptable to the country, and for that reason I oppose it. 
     
    
      
       Sir, as I formally seconded that motion perhaps it would be decent of me to give reasons for my action.  When I first saw that Article I viewed it, as I am sure everybody did, with the greatest suspicion.  I condemned it.  It seemed to me utterly out of place in a Democratic Constitution; it seemed to me to be the road to office.   I have thought over it and I have come to the conclusion it ought to be tried, for I think we are all aware of the abuses of the Party system that are current in most contemporary Constitutions. Deputy Burke pointed out how the patronage that was of the Government was confined in the hands of a single individual, often some dark, sinister figure in the background&mdash;a newspaper proprietor.  The very examples that Deputy Burke gave are a reason why we should try some system whereby such jobbery might be avoided, and by which patronage might be removed out of the hands of some single man or a group of men, and brought back to the central Assembly itself.  This scheme, I think, removes the patronage from the individual and places it in the hands of the Dail&mdash;the Committee elected by the Dail to select the candidates from whom these Ministers are finally selected.  The chief argument brought against the scheme seems to me that it is not a wise thing to try anything that is strange.  There is an assumption in that that the last word in Constitution-framing has been spoken; that the British Constitution is the best of Constitutions in the best of all possible worlds.  I, for one, do not believe that, and I think the analogy is completely false.  The social, economic, political, and historical conditions that face us are not the conditions under which the British Constitution has been evolved, and I think we should face the facts as we have been called upon to do so repeatedly in this Dail&mdash;face the living facts&mdash;of our own country, and not be afraid to make, I confess, an experiment. If mankind were afraid to make experiments where would we be?  We would be still sitting in skins, arguing out our little differences with stone axes.  Somebody brought in the tag about cheap experiments. There is another which says, &ldquo;Only by experiment can anything be accomplished.&rdquo;  We want to get the best Constitution, and we ought not to be afraid of making the trial.  Every Constitution is liable to abuse.  It should be the endeavour of this Committee which we have mentioned in the amendment to see that this experiment, as far as possible, should be fool-proof and knave-proof. If we do not find it works, it ought not to be difficult to go back; but do not let us keep clinging to the old exemplar,   which reminds me of the criticism of a great scholar, who remarked about those who cling so faithfully to the text of manuscript, however corrupt it is, that they cling to these texts in the way certain gentlemen cling to lamp-posts, not to find light for their own way, but to dissimulate their own instability.  One of the reasons that I do urge you to try this experiment is, we will not be a large Assembly and we cannot indulge in luxuries. I think the Party system is a luxury.  You have your Ministry with one eye on their political opponents, and the other eye, if they have it, on the common good.  We cannot waste efficiency and the brains of the country in that futile game of &ldquo;King of the Castle,&rdquo; which is all the Party system amounts to.  We want everybody, I imagine, in the Dail to contribute his wisdom to the difficult and intricate problems that face us.  We cannot waste time in party victories and political tactics. Of course, I have my doubts about many details.  I am very dubious about depriving representatives who have been elected by the country of their votes, when they are elected to one of those special portfolios.  But I think that is a matter on which the Committee may report.  I do not think there is any grievance upon the constituency.  Supposing you did deprive that Minister of portfolio, and force the constituency to elect another member, that constituency is in a particularly favourable position. It has got two friends in the Dail instead of one.  I do not think that the first representative will quite forget his old constituency, even if he is in the position of a Minister.  The second reason which induced me to support this motion was I thought it was a short way of dealing with the business before us.  I think we have been too much kitten-like, chasing our tails through a great maze of amendments, and I think this motion clears the air, because we are relegating a lot of detail to the Committee. If no better argument could be found for denouncing it than that there are abuses in the present Constitution under the Party System, I will vote for it, and will advise others, as strongly as I can, to do the same.  It is a venture, but &ldquo;nothing venture, nothing win.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       A Chinn Chomhairle, is mian liomsa cabhru le bunsmaoineamh an ruin seo, se sin go bhfeadfaidh an Dail daoine dtaobh   amuich de'n Oireachtas do thogha mar Airi Ise an fath go bhfuilim-se na fhabhar san na so&mdash;ise mo thuairim go dtuitean se amach go minic nach iad na daoine is fearr in aon tir a toghtar mar dhalltai de Phairlimint na tire.  Ma tugtar caoi do'n Dail daoine dtaobh amuich de'n Oireachtas do thogha mar Airi, beidh rogha niosa leithne ag an nDail daoine a bheidh oireamhnach chun oibre na tire do stiuru do sholathar agus do thogha chun na h-oibre sin. 
       Rud eile, dreir an ruin seo beidh a churam fein ar gach Aire: beidh se freagarthach do'n Dail i dtaobh a ghnotha fein agus beidh i gcumas na Dala aon Aire amhain do chur amach as a ait agus gan gadh an Aireacht go leir do chur amach de bharr droch-oibre an Aire ud. 
       Ni thuigim cad na thaobh go ndubhairt an Teachta de Burca na beadh aon bhaint ag an nDail leis na h-Airi ud: Ise an Dail fein a thoghfaidh na h-Airi ud chomh maith leis an Uachtaran. Mar sin, ma's daoine ciallmhara lucht na Dala fein ni toghfar einne acu ach daoine a dheanfaidh a ndicheall ar son na tire. Beidh an ghreim cheudna ag an nDail ar na h-Airi seo agus a bheidh acu ar na h-Airi eile. 
     
     I desire to say I favour the underlying principle of this resolution for two or three reasons.  One is that, as everybody knows, it is not always the best people in a country, for administration, that get into Parliament, and, consequently, it is desirable, more particularly in this country at the present time, that a choice should be given to the Dail to select persons outside the Parliament itself for Ministerial positions.  The argument that the Dail will not have control over such persons, is, to my mind, an argument that has no basis.  According to the arrangement which is in the Constitution itself, and which presumably, is the one that would be adopted if the idea itself is adopted, this Dail is the body that will select, or elect, the Ministers who are not Members of the Oireachtas.  Now, it has quite the same control&mdash;in fact, according to Article 51 it has the same control&mdash;over non-Dail members, non-Oireachtas members, as we may call them, of the Ministry that it will have over those nominated by the President.  According to Article 51, it is the President that will nominate certain members to be Ministers according to the   Article dealing with members who are not members of the Oireachtas; it is the Dail itself as a body that will nominate or select such Ministers. Therefore I think the argument that the Dail should not have control over them is an unsubstantial argument.  Consequently I am of opinion that we will do better service for the country in-having a wider range to select from than a selection from the Oireachtas itself, and also, as far as I judge, the principle of this is making the individual responsible to the Dail for his own particular Department, which in our case is a most desirable thing.  It has always seemed to me a defect in the party system which developed more particularly in England, and which the English have held up as one of the great things in their Constitution, that if a particular Minister is checked by his Parliament he may bring down the whole Ministry.  I think that is a defect in any system of Government, and it is far better to have a system of Government, to my mind, and more particularly in this country at the present time, that would make the individual Minister responsible.  There is no reason why the whole Cabinet or Government should resign if a particular Minister does something Parliament does not approve of.  In this case, as I understand, the Minister is responsible for his Department&mdash;he is responsible to the Dail.  The Dail can check that particular Minister, and, if it so wishes, a system can be devised by which he should resign and have another put in his place.  I think these reasons are quite sufficient to justify any member of this Assembly in supporting the ideas contained in this resolution.  But this I will say, I do not agree with the particular suggestion or draft of Article 50 in regard to this matter, whereby the majority of the Aireacht would be outside the Parliament.  I think it is desirable that the majority of the Aireacht should be within the Parliament and the minority chosen from outside. 
    
      
       There is a point in the amendment which is immediately before the Chamber in which it is stated that this Dail approves as a general principle of the proposal that certain members of the Executive Council need not be members of the Dail.   That, I take it, is only a general principle. In this amendment, to which we are asked to give our favour or adherence, all the other parts are matters upon which judgment would be reserved until the Committee is appointed.  In that connection I would like to point out&mdash;and I do not propose in what I say now to argue for or against the scheme generally accepted&mdash;to bring before the Dail certain historical facts which I believe may prove of help, because here we are at this moment in Ireland starting out without any support in our own experience.  We are compelled, therefore, in arguing with regard to these complex matters, to turn to other countries and to find what their experience may be.  It may prove indeed true that our experience of the future will be quite different from what theirs has been.  It may prove true that our experience in the future will be quite different from what theirs has been; but we have no reason for assuming that in advance, and in the absence of our own experience it is right for us, and not merely right for us, but urgent upon us, and it is our necessity, that we should turn to the experiences of other countries and see exactly how they have fared in regard to this very matter.  It is a remarkable fact, to which I would draw the attention of the Dail, that we have here in this book, which has been put into our hands, given a certain number of Constitutions of the world, and in not a single one of these Constitutions will a provision be found that Ministers must be members of the legislature.  In not a single one of these Constitutions is there any prohibition on any single legislature from going outside to choose Ministers.  There were two or three other Constitutions issued since this book was compiled, that I have had an opportunity of studying, and on that very matter I have turned to these and I find they bear out the embodied experience that will be found in these Constitutions bound here.  That is a very remarkable fact, and it is all the more remarkable when you turn to another fact, and that is, under no single Constitution and in no practice of any legislature, do they appoint Ministers who are outside the Dail.  Those two facts are very remarkable in their relations with one another.  In all countries the Parliament   can go outside itself to get Ministers, and yet suffer no constitutional violation; but in not one single country does it do so.  That is a fact we should give careful attention to.  It might be news to this Dail to learn that is not only true with regard to England, but it is actually true in regard to England in so far as England has a written Constitution, and we know, in spite of the statement that England has no written Constitution, that she has a written Constitution.  It is written in laws and charters that are available, and the Constitution of England is to be found in the Act of Settlement, and it there distinctly states that Ministers must not be members of the Legislature, and for two centuries afterwards England, in whose Constitution it was written that Ministers must not be members of the Legislature, compelled Ministers to be chosen only from the Legislature, because it was found that until it appointed Ministers only from the Legislature, it got Ministers who were subject to corruption, and Ministers over whom she could get no control. 
     
    
      
       Elected by Parliament. 
     
    
      
       These things I am stating now, if they are arguments, they are not my arguments; they are the arguments of experience and fact.  I recommend to the study of Ministers and Deputies a book entitled &ldquo;Governance of England,&rdquo; by Mr. Sidney Lowe, who writes with no admiration whatever of the present English system; indeed writes in criticism of it; and he brings this fact out that it would be better if Ministers were not members of the Legislature, and that it had been originally provided they should not, but that the Legislature insisted in the end, as the result of experience, that they must, because the Legislature wanted to get control of them. 
     
    
      
       Hear, hear.  They will under this. 
     
    
      
       Nevertheless, experiments have been made, and I would suggest to Deputy Alton a reflection upon the fact that England herself has lately experimented in this matter. It is not exactly the case that England and the English Parliament do not occasionally go outside the Parliament to get   Ministers.  Whenever the English Parliament has gone outside itself to get a Minister, it has had occasion to regret it. We remember the experience England had lately with regard to Sir Eric Geddes. The facts in that case are that the English Premier went outside and chose a man of very considerable experience and competency in administration.  They found in the end that they had to get rid of that Ministry, and caused the fall not merely of the Minister, but the destruction of his entire Department in administration without getting rid of the rest of the Ministry.  That actually was the case.  There is an illustration still nearer home.  There is the experience of Ireland itself.  I said we had no experience of our own to which we could turn.  I must qualify that.  We have a certain experience to which we can turn.  It is not an experience with which we can claim any continuity, but, nevertheless, it is an Irish experience.  It is the experience of the Parliament sitting from 1783 to 1799.  Any person who has studied the experience of that Parliament will have been frequently puzzled by the curious anomaly it presents to the Constitution. We call it Grattan's Parliament, but Grattan was not a Minister. The Ministers were, for a large part at least, not members of that Parliament. Grattan was a member of that Parliament, and I venture to say, if you study into the facts concerning that Parliament, it will be found, if Ministers had been Members of Parliament, that the Act of Union would never have been bought.  I share to the full and sympathise with those who desire to leave it open to the Legislature to bring in Ministers from outside.  I believe a Legislature in matters of this kind should be left as free as possible.  I feel that we will find our experience in this matter will not very greatly differ from the experiences of other countries; but I would like the Dail to remember what other countries have found, and among these countries I remember Switzerland, the very country that has been quoted as the chief exemplar of the contrary.  In Article 96 of the Swiss Constitution. which, I think, has been quoted here, or to which a reference has been made, and which in the Articles in the present draft is quoted, there reads the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Members of the Federal Council are appointed   every three years by the two Councils or by the two Houses in joint session, and are chosen from among all Swiss citizens eligible to the National Council.  Not more than one person from each canton may be chosen for the Federal Council.&rdquo; 
       When I first read this I was very deeply impressed by this fact, and I procured certain works dealing with the working of it, and I discovered this further fact, which I put before this Dail, as being noteworthy in this connection. This constitution in its first draft was passed in 1848.  These words first appeared in 1848.  I turn to see exactly how this provision worked out.  It was passed in 1848, and I learn from the work written by the chief authority on this matter that since 1848 until this moment, the Swiss Parliament had not chosen one Minister from outside itself. Every Minister who has been appointed has been appointed from among the members of the Parliament.  There were other matters which I wanted to mention, but I am informed by the Speaker I must break my speech at this point. 
     
    
      
       You cannot make a second speech on that particular point. 
     
    
      
       Deputy Figgis will have a better chance of getting into the Ministry from outside. 
     
    
      
       I am extremely sorry that you did not let Deputy Figgis proceed, because we might know in the end which way he was going to vote on this question. 
     
    
      
       Exactly. 
     
    
      
       I can assure you that I followed him very attentively and I really could not make out from which side he was addressing the Dail I want to make plain my position with regard to this motion.  I intend to vote against it on the grounds that I do not believe it is a democratic principle for this Dail to enunciate, that is, to bring in people who are not members elected on a democratic franchise.  I think myself that, unfortunately, we have enough permanent officials in this country, and my experience of permanent officials in the past is&mdash;that they run the Government, instead of the Government running them.  I do not wish to perpetuate such a state of affairs.  Perhaps   means could be devised whereby certain individuals, not perhaps members of the Government party, might be brought into the Ministry, and might be of considerable use, provided always that the Ministry had the nomination of them, but, as this motion stands at present, I cannot see my way to vote for it. 
     
    
      
       I will support this motion of Deputy Thrift's, because it seems to me we can in this way get away from the pernicious doctrine of collective responsibility in the Ministry.  It is for that reason, mainly, that I am inclined to support it.  We know it is the experience in England, and during our short experience in this country, too, that all the Ministers must hang together, and no matter how inefficiently any individual member of the Ministry carries on his business, all the other Ministers&mdash;efficient Ministers&mdash;consider it their duty to stand up for him and defend him.  I believe, by adopting this principle of individual responsibility, we will get away from that.  After all, Ministers appointed for internal administration&mdash;such as Education, Agriculture, Trade and Commerce&mdash;are appointed, or ought to be appointed because of their special qualifications for the posts.  They ought not, in my opinion, be put into a position of having to trim their sails in their own department to suit the particular general policy of the Ministry of the time.  I believe that this method of selecting Ministers, and making them individually responsible to the Dail, will make for continuity of policy in particular departments.  We know how necessary continuity of policy is in a particular department. Take an example here in Ireland.  In the Education Ministry, I think we have had four Ministers within the last eight months.  That continual changing of Ministers, because the Government, as a whole, happens to change, is not in my opinion good.  There is one thing in connection with this proposal, however, that I do not see the necessity for.  That is in the original Article, the provision by which a member of this Dail, appointed to one of these posts, is called on to resign his seat, and I have heard no satisfactory argument yet from anybody in support of that provision. The President, last night, did put forward an argument to the effect that a Minister appointed to one of these posts   would find himself in difficulties with his constituents, seeing that he had to be responsible to the whole country.  But, instead of that being an argument against the resignation of this particular Minister it would seem to me to be an argument in favour of the resignation of their seats by all the Ministers.  If a man is appointed President of this Dail he is responsible really for his policy to the whole country, and equally with the man who may be appointed Minister for Education or Local Government, who may find himself in difficulties with his particular constituency over individual matters.  But that after all is a detail. It has been stated here that we should not make this experiment&mdash;that this country should not be asked to make it. I am not afraid of making experiments. I think that our whole Parliament and Government is in the nature of an experiment. We are starting cut for the first time, and our whole administration will, for some years to come, be in the nature of an experiment, and I would prefer to be original in this direction rather than to be imitative.  I think it is not a very wide departure from what is usually done, and I do not think that the risk is sufficient to make us afraid of trying it as an experiment, and, therefore, I recommend this to the Dail. 
     
    
      
       The speech of Deputy O'Connell was welcome at this stage because it seemed to me that members were getting away after a particular point that is not the main point, and that is not essential to the proposals. The speech we have been listening to brings us back to the fact that the main point of the proposal is the idea of individual responsibility rather than the idea of non-membership.  They will, in fact, for all practical purposes be members of this Dail.  They will attend this Dail, and they will answer questions in this Dail.  They will speak in this Dail, and in every respect, except voting, they will be on an equal footing with every member in this Dail.  And that exception of the vote is to save them from the particular stigma attaching to the party spirit and to keep them simply people responsible to the Dail for the running of certain Departments.  They are to bring forward proposals from that Department in a way that will leave free thought and discussion here, and that will eliminate the evils of the party   system by which men vote for a particular Ministry under the crack of the party whip rather than bring down the Administration, of whose main policy they approve.  Because they approve of the main policy they feel bound to vote for practically every measure that Administration brings along.  These proposals will make the Irish Parliament what the British Parliament is not.  It will make it a deliberative Assembly that will weigh carefully on their merits the measures brought before it, and solely with an eye to the results of these measures in the country.  It will ensure that men will not vote for a particular measure that they think will have evil results for the country, simply to save that particular Administration.  That is one thing we must keep in mind, and we must not be diverted from the main object of the proposal to this mere accidental of non-membership.  To suggest that the members appointed from outside the Dail will not be responsible to the Dail and, through the Dail, to the people is to suggest a thing which is not, I submit, that the men elected to this Dail will feel a very real sense of responsibility to this Dail, and will feel as real a sense of responsibility, and have as real a contact, to this Dail as the Ministers whom the President may select.  Such Ministers may be removed. They may be removed under any one of three heads, malfeasance in office, incompetence, which you will agree is a very general term, or failure to carry out the expressed will of the Parliament. Is there any other reason why they should be removed?  These three heads are all-embracing, and give the reasons why a Minister should cease to be a Minister for a particular Department. Is there any reason why the Administration should fall because this Dail does not approve of the proposals put forward by the Minister, say, for Education? Is there any reason, again, why the Administration should fall because some new proposal of the Minister for Agriculture is not approved by this Dail? On the other hand, if the main policy of the President and his four Ministers comes to be rejected by this Dail, is there any reason why the Minister for Agriculture, who is running his Department efficiently and for the benefit and advantage of the country as a whole, should also leave his particular office?   Is there any reason, if the Dail changes its view with regard to the external policy of the country, why some Minister for Education, under whose care education has flourished in the country, should leave his office?  These are the glaring and obvious evils of a Party system, and it is these evils we are out to remove. Yesterday I pointed out that under the change in Article 49 you are doing nothing cast-iron in this Constitution.  Any time within eight years you can amend that Constitution by ordinary legislation. If we admit the evils of the British Party system of Government, if we can see them clearly, if we admit it is wrong to have a man, almost as a matter of routine, voting against his best judgment under the crack of the Party Whip, is it not worth while to try and get away from that, and try to forge here a system that will enable men to remain in politics and to remain honest. 
     
    
      
       On a point of order, the Minister has told us that the real and essential thing which we are to adopt and to vote upon is the doctrine of individual responsibility.  Last evening those of us who spoke on the matter were under the impression that we were to discuss and vote upon the motion of Deputy Professor Thrift.  I may have an erroneous document in my hand.  It was given to me officially, and it reads this way: &ldquo;That this Dail approves of the general principle of the proposal that certain members of the Executive Council, etc., need not be Members of the Dail.&rdquo; Now, I would like to have your ruling as to the essential thing upon which we are to vote&mdash;the doctrine that members of the Executive Council need not be Members of the Dail, but may be distinguished citizens outside; or is it the doctrine of rejecting collective responsibility in favour of individual responsibility of Ministers? 
     
    
      
       I think the terms of the resolution should be interpreted by the Deputies themselves. 
     
    
      
       The motion which we are discussing is: &ldquo;That this Dail approves, as a general principle, of the proposal that certain members of the Executive Council, nominated by the Dail and individually responsible to the Dail alone for the Departments respectively under their charge, need not be members of the Dail,&rdquo; etc. 
     
     
    
      
       I would like to add a word or two to the words I used last night for the purpose of inducing my own colleagues to vote as I would like to have them vote&mdash;for this resolution. We are not voting for the clause on the Draft Constitution.  I agree with the Minister for Home Affairs when he emphasises that the most important principle involved in that resolution is that which says that certain members of the Ministry shall be nominated by the Dail, not by the President, and individually responsible for their own departments to the Dail and not as members of a collective Cabinet who would stand or fall with the Cabinet decision. That, to me, is the more important principle involved, especially so in view of the speech of Deputy Figgis, where he points out what you are asked to do in the first case is to see that Ministers need not be members of the Dail.  That is the practice in every other country. 
     
    
      
       I should like to correct the speaker.  I said not the practice,&mdash;the practice is the other way&mdash;but the principle. 
     
    
      
       So far as the Constitution is concerned the practice is that there should be no compulsory membership of the Dail, but the practice in effect is that the Ministers are members of the particular legislative body.  That may become the practice in Ireland under the provisions of this motion, but I should like to remind the Dail that in the instances which Deputy Figgis adduced, particularly the English examples, there is a great difference and it lies here, that no member of the Ministry or Member of the Cabinet was allowed to address the House, or attend the House, or be answerable to the House in any way, unless he were a member of that House, and consequently when Premiers went outside the legislature for a Minister he had to find a seat or else resign.  Sometimes he carried on his Ministerial office for weeks or months until he was excluded because of his inability to find a constituency to choose him, but if he had been able to attend the House and to report to the House on the conduct of his administration as is proposed here, that difficulty would not have arisen, and that makes all the difference in the   case.  The proposals that certain Ministers shall be nominated by the Dail itself and not by the President, to be responsible to that Dail directly on account of the administration of their particular department, is one that should commend itself to the Dail.  The fact that that Minister may possibly not be a member of the Dail should not weigh too much because of this very important principle.  As the Minister for Home Affairs has pointed out, he must be at the call of the Dail, to attend the Dail to answer any questions to the Dail, and to give an account of his stewardship in person and not through the mouth of any other Minister.  It was suggested to me that this was apt to lead to bureaucratic centralisation, and to leave patronage and power in the hands of men and women perhaps not amenable to the Assembly, but it was forgotten that that man would be responsible in person to the Dail, and that his office would only last as long as the Parliament itself would last. That before he could take up office again he would have to be re-elected by the Parliament, so that the danger of bureaucracy is very greatly minimised and is no greater under the provisions of proposals than under the conditions of any ordinary Minister who may be politically appointed.  I hope that all my friends, at any rate, and any others I can influence, will vote for this proposal. 
     
    
      
       I did not intend to intervene in this debate at all, and I would not have intervened but for the ironical observations made by Deputy Darrell Figgis just now.  He delivered an admirable address in favour of the scheme and in favour of Deputy Professor Thrift's amendment, but from the ironical way in which he did it he might have been speaking on either side.  He stated with great solemnity and emphasis that numerous Constitutions all over the world provide means whereby a Government can take their Ministers from outside, but that in practice they never do so.  Then he said likewise that in the Swiss Constitution, which was 75 years old, they had power to get their Ministers from anywhere, but that in all that time they had never done so.  If that proves anything, it proves to my mind conclusively that in the best-run Governments   and Parliaments in the world, the President, the Parliament, or whoever may be the appointing authority to appoint Ministers will, if you fail to make mandatory upon him the duty of taking some men from outside, find himself up against vested interests every time, will find it impossible on account of interests of Party or machine, will find it impossible to choose the best men; and is Deputy Figgis going to suggest seriously that in seventy-five years the best Minister for Education and the best Minister for Agriculture were always and invariably to be found among the people elected to Parliament?  That is what the argument is, and I assume that it was ironical.  In Ireland it would be exactly the same thing.  You would get, perhaps, twelve Ministers.  Every man in this Dail knows, in respect to some at least of those, I do not know how many, where political capacity is not by any means the main requirement, it is exceedingly likely that your best man will be outside and not inside the Dail.  I say your President of the Dail will, owing to Party ties and vested interests, find it impossible to get that best man from outside unless you have a provision whereby a certain number of your Ministers must be taken from outside. 
     
    
      
       There is a good deal of confusion about this matter, and as it may be even in my own mind, I would like some Minister or someone who may be supporting the resolution to remove it, as otherwise I must vote against the resolution.  People talk as if the only question involved here was whether certain Ministers should or should not be members of this Dail.  The Constitution only refers to members of the Executive Council, and that is a Council of Government with the entire control of Finance. We have already passed a Section 36 of this Constitution that no money may be appropriated at all without the advice of the Executive Council.  Personally I would not have the least objection to having any number of Ministers heads of their own Department, and not members of this Dail, if proper people could be found who were not members of this Dail, but it is an entirely different thing to say that they shall be in the Executive Council controlling   Finance.  Here it reads as if they were controlling their own Departments. The clause has been read as if these individual Ministers were to be responsible for their own Departments. It is entirely the opposite.  In Articles 37 and 36 no money can be appropriated at all except on the advice of the Executive Council and that of the people who are to frame the Budget, which is to be presented by the Minister himself. He may have done that on the motion of that very Executive Council.  He comes here from the people who form the considerable portion of the majority behind him, who sent him up to move it, though he may be of an entirely different way of thinking.  The main point in this clause is not the number of Ministers. What I object to is not the number of Ministers, but the use of the words &ldquo;Executive Council,&rdquo; and you are asked to approve of the principle that members of the Executive are not to be members of this Dail at all. Unless somebody can show me some good reason why this body that is going to have sole control of the finances of Ireland is to be composed, possibly of part, and possibly of a majority, of persons who are not members of this Dail at all I cannot support it.  It is the Executive Council which has to recommend or approve of the granting of titles to the members of the Irish Free State.  I do not suppose that there will be many, but that is another of the duties cast on the Executive Council.  If this Clause were withdrawn or modified in a manner that so many here advocated that there might be Ministers who are not members of the Dail, but merely Ministers who would control their own Department and their own Department alone and be individually responsible for their own Department, then I would support it with a heart and a half.  But this is entirely a different thing from saying that they should be members controlling the whole finance of the Dail and of the country.  Really Deputy Johnson throughout his speech in this matter appeared to me to labour under that confusion of mind.  At least that was the impression the speech conveyed to me. It may be that it was in my own mind the confusion existed.  He spoke of Ministers who shall be altogether responsible for their own Departments and   he never used the words &ldquo;Executive Council&rdquo; at all.  He called them Ministers all through. 
     
    
      
       Deputy O'Connell spoke of the system in England which made Ministers hang together. But I think if this Article is passed some future generation in Ireland will decide that this present Ministry ought all hang together. 
     
    
      
       And now? 
     
    
      
       This Article has to be changed very radically before it gets my support.  As it stands I intend to fight every stage of these proceedings. I think it is reactionary and subversive of all democratic principle and can only result in government by permanent officials, and God knows permanent officials are the greatest stumbling blocks to democratic progress that any progressive movement has to fight against.  We want a Government that is amenable to the will of the people. We want Ministers who are to express the will of the people, whose actions are responsive to the pulse of the people's demands.  And I contend that in carrying out the objects of this Article you are doing something that will make Ministers impervious to the pulse or will or desires of the people.  Now, the Minister for Home Affairs last night spoke about my love of the British party system. I cannot understand why the Minister for Home Affairs is suffering from that hallucination.  I can only come to the conclusion that the poverty of his arguments in favour of this Article indicated that his heart and the hearts of the Ministers are not really on the side of these extraordinary proposals. Now, weigh up the arguments for and against, consider the wealth of logic and reason against it, and observe the bankruptcy of the arguments for it.  Both the President and the Minister for Home Affairs have done their best for these extreme proposals.  I admire their special pleading, but I do not admire the extraordinary dilemma in which they were placed by trying to foist upon this Assembly and upon the Government some scheme of Departmental, or, I should say, Governmental control which, in their heart of hearts, they must know is repugnant to every democratic instinct, both in this Dail and in the country.  In this debate   Deputy Gavan Duffy said a curious thing.  He said that it might possibly be that the best men were outside the Dail and not inside it.  Well, when I listened to his arguments, and the arguments of some of the Ministers, I came to the conclusion that that really was the case.  These whole proposals seem to me to lack absolutely, confidence for the future of the country.  If we are going to interpret this aright, it expresses utter mistrust of what the decision of the people will be.  It seems to say the people will not send to the Sovereign Assembly men who can be trusted to discharge efficiently functions of the Government. I can read no further implication into that Article but that.  That may be right.  The Ministers who at present compose this Government may be quite justified in the opinion they have held, that there is no one else in the Assembly capable of exercising the reins of office.  That may be a well-founded decision, but if it is well-founded I have no doubt the country, when it gets a chance, will speedily dispose of the people&mdash;outside, of course, of the present Ministry.  To assume that this is an Assembly poor in personality, and poor in capacity for administration would, I think, be a mistake, but no one, I think, would assume that this present Assembly has got fixity of tenure in this institution. I believe there will be very considerable changes, numerous changes in the personnel of this institution when the people get a chance.  I would not be surprised in the slightest if I disappeared from this Assembly myself.  I believe it would be quite possible to get someone infinitely better fitted to discharge the function of representing the people than myself. 
     
    
      
       No, no. 
     
    
      
       It is quite possible that the Minister may be justified in that assent, but I will require some better argument than he put up for this Article to convince me that he is correct in what he said himself of the present proposal.  Now, this is not a matter for banter or joking.  It is something that is going to have a most vital effect upon the whole future administration of the country&mdash;the most vital effect. And this Parliament, this Sovereign Assembly, which has not quite yet got beyond the stage of drafting Standing   Orders to regulate procedure, and which has not really got outside the fetters of alien administration, is embarking upon an experiment which the oldest established Governments have not yet entered upon.  Do not let us imagine that the whole completion of Ireland's social evolution is to be discharged by this Assembly.  We need not be in too big a hurry.  We have waited for 700 years to get rid of foreign control. Surely we can wait for six or seven years to get rid of the relics or heritage of the British party system if we find that it is inimical to this country.  But a rush into this extraordinary proposal before we had time to take our bearings is unwise; to launch this country into an adventure, as someone called it, is not, to my mind, exactly what wise and sagacious statesmen should advise the country.  I imagine that if we want to advance there is quite sufficient spirit of adventure in the country at the present time.  I do not see why this Assembly should view the object of its deliberations and decision in the spirit of adventure.  Let us view them in the spirit of reason and common sense and not embark upon rash experiments which may lead us, God knows where. Now, I think I have nearly exhausted my ten minutes. 
     
    
      
       You have three minutes more. 
     
    
      
       Good.  I may be able to get three more arguments before I finish.  The Minister for Home Affairs suggested that the amendment to Article 49 would enable us to change these Articles later on if we find they are not effective.  Well, I tell you when permanent officials dig themselves in securely it will take more than what is embodied in that amendment to Article 49 to get them out when we want to get them out.  Deputy Alton said something about this Assembly acting like kittens chasing their tails.  If this is passed I tell you, if what is recommended and embodied in this motion is passed, we will not be going like kittens chasing our tails, but we will be chasing the idea of democratic government through a maze of official red tape.  I am utterly opposed to this.  I said yesterday that I was open to conviction. There has not been a single sound argument urged in favour of this proposal since the motion came before the Dail.   There has been an absolute bankruptcy of argument, of intelligence behind the advocacy of it; and I intend, until there is a change in that respect, to oppose this motion and all that it comprehends as tenaciously as I can, as I think it is retrogressive and anti-democratic and subversive to the thing we are trying to establish&mdash;that the expression of the people's will shall be seen and felt through this Assembly. 
     
    
      
       I do not think Deputy Milroy will really want the Dail to believe that all the intelligence and democracy is always behind whatever he backs up? 
     
    
      
       Oh, yes. 
     
    
      
       And that there is no intelligence behind anything else.  When speaking yesterday, I put my views as clearly as I could, and I do not intend to put them again.  I only intend to refer to one or two points raised by Deputy Fitzgibbon and Deputy Milroy.  I am not, as I indicated yesterday, very enthusiastic at all about the original proposal as it is in the draft, but then one cannot get up a great deal of enthusiasm about any kind of machinery, and this is a piece of machinery.  I am not even enthusiastic about the Constitution, let alone about the Executive Council.  There is, I think, a fatal defect indicated by Deputy Fitzgibbon, and it is included, I am sorry to say, in Deputy Thrift's proposal.  That is the question of members of the Executive Council.  If it were the Ministry it would be quite a different thing altogether.  It may have escaped my notice yesterday evening, but I certainly am backing the proposal, and if I am to back it now, I would make it the Ministry, and not the Executive Council.  As Deputy Fitzgibbon and others well know, in other Constitutions, particularly in Dominion Constitutions, there are Ministries and Councils, not altogether distinct in personnel; but I do back the thing now for the Ministry to a certain extent as an experiment. I do not see any reason at all, certainly there has not been any convincing argument put up, against the proposal as applying to the Ministry, or why it should not be tried as an experiment, seeing that, according to the change made yesterday in Article 49, I think, if it is a bad thing, it will be easy for the next   Parliament, or the Parliament coming after, to change it.  Quite easy; and I think that the experiment is worth trying, but it should be the Ministry, and not the Executive Council.  When I support Deputy Thrift's motion, it is rather to get the reference back to the Dail. Precisely so, that it may come up not exactly  de novo , but he thrashed out again by a small Committee in which the details may be worked out, more at all events to my satisfaction than in the original articles, and brought up here in a more concise and practical form, that would meet the points of view of those who are reluctant to accept it, Deputy Fitzgibbon and others, on certain points, but who would like to try the experiment on other points.  It seems to me Deputy Milroy's argument about Ministers might as well apply to the appointment or choice of the Ministers by the Dail.  I do not say that this Dail or any future Dail will be the repository of all the wisdom.  As a matter of fact, I think it largely will not be, and on this thing, if not on the question of foreign war, I am willing to let the Dail experiment a bit, and the people&mdash; the electors&mdash;can pull it up if it goes wrong.  If I understand Deputy Milroy aright, the same argument can be applied against the choice or confirmation by the Dail of the appointment of the other Ministers. 
     
    
      
       You do not understand Deputy Milroy aright. 
     
    
      
       I will support it, and the argument advanced in support of the whole idea has made me more and more convinced that it ought to be tried.  As I say, I am not very enthusiastic about it.  If I am to support Deputy Thrift's motion I think the wording would have to be changed to Ministry.  I would not have those not directly responsible having power, any share of the power, of the appropriation of finance. 
     
    
      
       I would like to make this point, before the Deputy goes further, that I think the Ministry and the Executive in the Constitution were intended to be interchangeable terms. 
     
    
      
       We can alter that. 
     
    
      
       The one great feature of Deputy Thrift's proposal,   which recommends it to me in so far as I can agree with it at all, was to save the time of the Dail by referring to a Select Committee all these different points, so that the Dail can discuss in full Committee of the Dail the report which would give us light and leading. Now, we spent a considerable time last evening and to-day trying to determine what it is that is contained in the motion, and that we are to vote upon.  There are really now, as I understand the interpretation of the Minister for Home Affairs, really three things contained in this: first&mdash;the important thing&mdash;the proposal to refer certain articles to a Committee.  For that I will most certainly vote.  There is also the declaration that this Dail approves that certain members of the Executive Council need not be members of the Dail, and that I hold or submit is the central part of the motion as it is now worded.  The Minister for Home Affairs asks us to believe that the essence, the kernel, of the thing in it is not that on the doctrine of individual as against collective responsibility of Ministers.  Now I defy the Minister, according to any rule of commonsense, to support his contention that this Dail &ldquo;approves of the general principle of the proposal that certain members of the Executive Council nominated by the Dail and individually responsible to the Dail alone for the Departments respectively under their charge,&rdquo; etc.  That is a description of the members, and nothing but a description of the members who need not be members of the Dail.  Suppose some one stood up and proposed here that Deputies wearing white hats shall not receive any allowance for expenses.  That would not, if we passed it, commit us to any doctrine about the wearing of white hats.  It would merely proclaim if and when a Deputy should so choose to decorate himself that this penalty would follow.  With all due submission to you, I maintain that if I vote Ta in this division I am really voting for one thing of which I heartily approve, for another thing of which I do not approve, and for another thing which I am asked to believe on faith is contained by some sort of implication in the words, and is not contained.  If Deputy Johnson proposed as a distinct proposition that this Dail approves of the doctrine of individual responsibility   I should support it and vote for it. It is a most important thing to have a declaration of the Dail on this very material question.  I do not know if it has been done intentionally, but Article 50 has been linked up with quite a variety of other things altogether different. Observe that these in and out Ministers, as I call them, who are members of the Dail for the purpose of speaking and answering questions, but are not members for the purpose of voting, are to be appointed by a Committee of the Dail. And we were told because the electorate sent the members that may ultimately compose that Committee to this Dail that therefore the electorate were controlling the selection of the Ministry. Is there no precedent to guide us in this matter in the history of other countries? You are all perfectly aware that in the original Constitution of the United States provision was made for the appointment of a President, the highest Executive Officer.  The people elected a college of electors, and they in their superior wisdom did select the men who were to select the President.  That is still on paper, but it is evaded, and it is a thing quite easy to evade, and it could work on parallel lines here.  We have seen already how Committees are appointed in this Dail.  The very first time there was a question of appointing a Committee the Deputy who proposed the members of the Committee in a moment of absentmindedness lapsed into the expression of the ordinary meeting: &ldquo;I have been asked to propose this resolution.&rdquo;  In a future Dail in the members of the Select Committee who are to appoint these in and out Ministers there may not be the same frankness and honesty of statement, but the fact will be that there will be those who will arrange beforehand who shall form the personnel of that Committee, and that Committee so selected is to select a small number of men to control all the entire appointments. Only the pretence is there that certain members of the Ministry are selected by the people.  I do not know if I am at liberty to debate the further point, because I really do not know how much or how little is in this resolution. What is the idea in all of this thing? That you are to have permanent heads of departments working out, with all their special ability and all their excellent   qualifications, all great constructive schemes.  What is the period of office they are to hold?  Their stability of office is for four years&mdash;four years in which to build up the machinery of the constructive institutions.  And the man from outside the Parliament who has distinguished himself in some department of public activity is to be invited to give up his own profession, and to come here to be a Minister for four years.  And not only that.  If he has been selected by a constituency he has to resign his seat, and at the end of four years, or perhaps even earlier, because remember he may be dismissed for incompetence, and incompetence, as the Minister for Home Affairs is careful to tell you, is a very wide term.  Suppose the Minister of one department wants to spend money, and the Minister for Finance wants to have a good Balance Sheet to produce in his Budget, may not that be deemed incompetence, if the Minister for Finance is the dominant personality of his Cabinet?  There are a dozen interpretations of incompetence. So that this distinguished man from outside the Dail may find himself before four years have elapsed a man retired from his profession, without his seat and with the animosity of his constituency, because he has plunged it into another election, which under another system of representation has returned, perhaps, someone of a party the opposite to what he was representing.  He is without his profession, without his constituency, without his Ministry, and this in the name of democracy.  Is that the new experiment that you are to try upon the Irish Nation, at the very outset of its career?  We have heard enough in other Parliaments about experiments. You remember that the sending of a great army to Gallipoli was called a gamble.  It was supported as a gamble. Are we in the very first stage of our attempts, in constructing the basis of the Irish Nation to try these Gallipoli tricks?  It seems to me that to support this thing because it is novel, is merely the  ad captandem  argument of young people.  We passed an Article of the Constitution a few days ago, which gives universal suffrage, and we shall shortly have every boy and girl of twenty-one years returning members of the Dail.  Strange to say, Deputy O'Shannon did not like that.  He did not say he did not like it, but he forecasted   resolutions in future Dails, notwithstanding the fact that we are to have universal suffrage.  We are trying experiments, remember, at a very rapid rate.  Universal suffrage with the age of the electors twenty-one is an experiment. This other is an experiment.  I repeat the making of a college out of which to select, or by instrumentality of which to appoint Ministers is going against the whole experience of the political workings of the political machine in the United States. 
     
    
      
       I think that Deputies who have spoken in opposition to this fantastic proposal or novel experiment have been looking at it from the point of view that we are going to do something that will come into operation to-morrow instead of the fact that we are committing ourselves to a clause in the Constitution which will allow a future Dail in the nation to do something upon these lines if it so chooses.  I raised a point in connection with this matter last night, and until that particular point is cleared up to my satisfaction, I cannot make up my mind what way I will vote.  It is on the lines of the speech made by Deputy Fitzgibbon, who proposed that the point could be got over if this proposal of Professor Thrift were allowed to be amended in this form.  I do not know whether it is open to amend the amendment, but, if so, I would propose that: &ldquo;This House approves of the general principle of the proposal that the minority of the members of the Executive Council nominated by the Dail are individually responsible to the Dail alone for the Departments respectively in their charge and need not be members of the Dail.&rdquo;  Deputy Burke, who, to a large extent, was supported by Deputy Milroy, seemed to be under the impression that the people of Ireland, in future, may not always be a bulwark against treachery in high places.  I think we are providing against treachery such as that referred to by Deputy Burke, by the Referendum, which is now part of the Constitution, and I feel that this Dail or any future Dail in Ireland, will never do anything radically wrong without being pulled up by a section of this Dail that will allow the Referendum on whatever the particular matter may be at the time.  I would like to face this thing, not from the point of view   of how the Party system worked in England. As far as I am concerned, I would not like to see the Party system in England working in this country.  I remember reading&mdash;and I may say I am not an historian, and I do not like looking upon experiments of this kind as to how they have been supported by history in this or that country&mdash;but I remember reading a case where in the British House of Commons, a Minister&mdash;I think Mr. Masterman was his name&mdash;was unable to find sufficient support at one, two, or three elections to get himself elected as a Minister of a certain Department, and I think, in the meantime, he carried on the functions of the particular office he held in the British Cabinet at that time.  I do not think this Dail, or any House of Parliament, wants to do that, by putting into the Constitution something that will allow that to go on.  I think the clause submitted by Deputy Thrift would provide against such a thing as that happening in this country.  I want, however, to see that it will be clearly laid down in whatever clause is agreed to, so far as this particular point is concerned, that Ministers responsible for matters of policy must be elected Members to this Dail, and must be a majority of the members that go to make up the Executive Council.  If I can get a satisfactory answer upon that particular aspect of the case, I am prepared to vote for this novel experiment, no matter how much I may dislike nomination or co-option.  I think it is quite clear to every member of the Dail that, while we may vote for the general principle that is enunciated in the amendment put up by Deputy Thrift, it will be for this Dail, or the future Free State Parliament or Parliaments, to say whether or not it would be desirable to have nominated officials or Ministers responsible to this Dail.  It may be, as in the case of other countries referred to by Deputy Darrell Figgis, that they will not agree to put these things into operation, but I want to be quite clear that the majority of the Executive Council will be elected members of this Dail, and responsible to this Dail and the country so far as matters of general policy are concerned. 
     
    
      
       I would like to answer the point raised by Deputy Gavan Duffy, who referred to my irony, and he went on to say&mdash;and I ask   Deputies to pay careful attention to this, because, in the historic phrase of Deputy Milroy, &ldquo;he let the cat out of the bag&rdquo;&mdash;that unless it were stated in the Constitution that a certain proportion must be&mdash;whether the Legislature like it or not&mdash;the Legislature would never do it.  In other words, the proposal is that we here are to be asked to insist that a certain thing should be done which future Legislatures would not do if they had any option in the matter.  I think that was a very significant remark for Deputy Gavan Duffy to have made.  I admire his frankness, but I do not so much admire his discretion. Deputy Magennis referred to this, on the other hand, as a gamble.  I think this is a gamble.  Some of us may like a gamble, but let future Legislatures gamble if they want to, but do not let us insist beforehand that they must gamble, however little disposed they may be to do it.  With regard to the one argument that was raised by Deputy Davin I want to touch upon that before coming to the matter raised by the Minister for Home Affairs.  Deputy Davin said there was a check in the Referendum.  I think we had better recognise&mdash;and I ask members to look over that clause dealing with the Referendum and think over it carefully to-night, and I think they will see, so far as the Constitution is concerned, the Referendum will be a dead letter unless it is put into operation by the Senate.  It is a physical impossibility to get the required signatures in the time required by the Constitution.  The Referendum will be no guard.  The Minister for Home Affairs brought in a new point which, I agree with Deputy Magennis, is not in this resolution at all, except brought in as by way.  That is that the real point to be stated is not whether Ministers were not members of the Legislature or are not to be appointed, but whether Ministers are or are not to have collective responsibility.  I agree that there is a very strong case that there should be a loosening of the bonds of collective responsibility, but, while there should be that loosening of these bonds, on the other hand we must remember the very, very important Constitutional point of efficient working to which Deputy Fitzgibbon referred, that, however the Executive responsibility may be loosed, however the administrative joint responsibility   may be loosed, there must be some one common responsibility in coming down to the Legislature and asking for the expenditure of money, and that joint responsibility has been already adopted by us.  I think that that is a wise and necessary provision, and that, whatever else be done with regard to providing the loosening of these bonds of joint responsibility is the one point we should be very careful not to impair.  We know exactly what has happened in several of our County Councils where there has not been some gathering up of single and joint responsibility in the expenditure of money and where it has happened that monies have been spent on one matter, then on some second matter, and then on some third matter, and after these monies have been voted the enquiry has been made as to what reference the responsibilities incurred had to the liabilities of the exchequer, and I think the liability of the exchequer ought to be considered before the responsibilities have actually been incurred.  The third point in the discussion is with regard to this Committee.  I think every advantage would be served by letting a Committee be appointed and letting a Committee go over the Articles, either representing them as they are now or revising or rejecting them and substituting others for them, leaving this Dail entirely free to a new consideration of the Articles, as they will be presented by the Committee, without being bound in any way.  That is a case for which a very strong argument could be made out, and in that sense I would like to see a Committee appointed.  The part I object to in the resolution of Deputy Professor Thrift is that we should be asked to agree to a principle and then, although I believe in the resolution itself that principle is perfectly clear we should be informed at a later date by a Minister that the principle to which we agreed is not the principle actually in the resolution.  We ought to be perfectly clear of what that principle is, and so far as I am concerned I would agree with the principle that there should be a loosening of the bonds of collective responsibility.  I agree, too, on the matter of legislative freedom&mdash; freedom of future Legislatures.  I agree that if the Legislatures want to appoint members as Ministers who are not members   of the Legislature they should be free to do so.  The point I would like to make is that we must not stand here and say that future Legislatures must do so whether they like to or not; whether they find it convenient or inconvenient. 
     
    
      
       I expect to hear before the close of this debate some Minister explaining the position a little bit more clearly than it has been explained to us so far.  I would be prepared to support the motion of Deputy Thrift, subject to certain safeguards; but I would not be prepared to give a blank cheque to any person upon this matter.  I would first wish to make sure that it will only be a minority, in any case, of Ministers who will be selected outside the elected members of this Dail.  After that I would wish to be satisfied that these Ministers who are selected would be individually responsible to the Dail alone for the departments under their charge.  In the case of an estimate for Supply coming from these departments, should the Dail disapprove of this, it should not be taken as a defeat of the Government, and should only involve the retirement of the Minister in question.  We want to be able to control extravagance without changing Governments.  The danger of these bodies is the danger of extravagance. I would like to know if this proposal has any meaning in another direction.  There are certain agencies in this country that are at present diverted from this Dail, and they are standing by themselves on account of the allegation they make that they have not sufficient elective power in the country to enable them to have representations here proportionate to what they believe their interests and their importance would need.  I would like to know if there is any suggestion in this motion that this is meant to be used as a lever in the hands of the Government for the purpose of enabling these interests that are at present so hesitant, to come here, and to have a uniformity of affairs in this country.  If it meant that, it certainly would, I think, deserve the support of the members of the Dail as an experiment, but only to the extent that of the Ministers of the Executive only a minority would be selected outside this Dail.  If I were satisfied on   these points, I would support Deputy Thrift's proposal. 
     
    
      
       There is one aspect of this resolution that I am more or less in agreement with.  It provides, I think, some protection for the people of the country from the Parliament. Judging by some of the speeches, or, rather, the multiplicity of speeches, I do believe the country ought to be protected from the Dail. To my mind, the Ministers outside of the Parliament will be more or less super Civil Servants. We know that most of the heads of those Departments are very hard to remove&mdash; so hard to remove that death has to come to remove some of them.  Fortunately for us and for the nation, death did come and remove some of them.  I have no objection to this proposal, but I want to know how are these Ministers going to be removed?  Will a vote of want of confidence passed in this Dail remove any one of those Ministers?  If that were so. I would be satisfied; but if there are going to be lengthy investigations and inquiries and wire-pulling, I do not like it.  If a clear vote of want of confidence will remove a Minister I will support the proposal.  There is another thing I want to have made clear.  It has been said that the electing of a Minister will involve a contest in his district, and it is said this would not disfranchise his constituents. I know it could happen.  Take a constituency sending five members here, three of whom would be of one way of thinking and two of another way of thinking.  If you select one of these two as a Minister, and then have an election back in his district, it is possible one of the two would be disfranchised.  I do not think there ought to be any sending back to the constituency.  I think the Minister ought to be allowed to retain his seat without any re-election.  If you are going to have re-elections you will knock the bottom out of Proportional Representation. While you have Proportional Representation you cannot be sending a Minister back for re-election; you will have to have one thing or the other.  I do not like that suggestion of 4 in or 8 out.  I would be more agreeable to, and would probably support, a motion where you would say a majority in and a minority out.  I think it deserves a trial.  The majority should be   elected by the country; a majority of the Executive Council should certainly be elected.  I think if you say &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this Article, it would meet the wishes of most of the people in this House.  To say &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would make it mandatory. 
     
    
      
       It is Deputy Thrift's motion we are dealing with, and not the Article. 
     
    
      
       If you use &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the Article when it is finally framed, you would make it mandatory; if you say &ldquo;may,&rdquo; it is optional, and I think that is good enough.  If I can get an assurance that there will be no re-elections, and that a vote of want of confidence of this Parliament will remove a Minister elected in accordance with the proposal I certainly will support it, but not until these things are made clear. 
     
    
      
       While I should most certainly strongly advocate the individual responsibility of Ministers, I must say I cannot at all approve of this motion, for the simple reason that we are asked here to adopt another principle, and that is that Ministers who have not been elected to this Dail may be brought into an Excutive Council or the Ministry.  On the face of it, it is quite clear that a candidate who might have been turned down at the polls would be taken and placed in the Ministry of the country.  I do not think that would be a very democratic course. Apart from that, at the present moment in this Parliament we are advocating the supremacy of Parliament and we are advocating the principle that the people shall control the Parliament.  I think it altogether inconsistent, at a time when we are doing that very important matter, to propose that we should bring in people who have not faced the electorate for one reason or another, or who possibly might have been turned down by the electorate, into the very Ministry of the Parliament. Neither do I think it proper that people should be allowed to sit and speak and answer questions in this Dail who have not been sent here by the people to do these things.  I am not at all sure that we cannot find the means if, as I strongly advocate, a Committee be appointed to look into this whole question of the Executive Council, whereby Ministers may be made individually responsible   other than by the proposal now submitted to the Dail. 
       It is very desirable that there should be an individual responsibility of Ministers for their Department, because I think it absurd that a whole Ministry should be turned down for the inefficiency or negligence of one of its members.  A Ministry, after all, is a human institution, and every human institution is quite liable to error, but it is not fair nor just that a whole Ministry should be turned down for the negligence of one man.  Neither is it fair that the whole country should be turned upside down and thrown into the vortex of an election because one minister for one reason or another has neglected to perform his duty: I would strongly advocate, therefore, that Deputy Thrift would so modify his motion, that the Dail would not be committed to the principle of external, or what I would call &ldquo;out&rdquo; Ministers.  If he will modify the motion in such a way I will certainly support it, but I will have to vote against it if it is to be put in its present form. 
     
    
      
       I am going to vote against this motion.  I am against any body of men being brought into an Assembly such as this if they cannot win the confidence of the electors.  I am also against nominated bodies, no matter from what side they come. I know in Professor Thrift's motion it says details of the provisions for appointing such ministers and for regulating their position should be referred to a Committee of the Dail to be nominated by the Ministry.  Why should they be nominated by the Ministry? If the motion did pass with these words out of it the Committee to look after these individuals brought in should be appointed by this Dail, each member having his share of responsibility in fixing the duties of such Ministers.  I am against nominated bodies and I am against unrepresentative men getting into this Dail.  I think, as has been said so often by all the other speakers, that it is a reactionary measure, and it ought not to be supported. 
     
    
      
       Before coming to the other points I would like to refer to one or two things that seem to me to be a bit contradictory, both in Professor Thrift's notice of motion and in the Articles that follow, and they all turn on   one another so intimately that it is very difficult to refer to one without having reference to the others.  The motion before the Dail arises out of Article 52, but Article 53 upsets Article 52, so where we are between them I would like to have some guidance on.  The motion before the Dail suggests that the Committee selected should be one for appointing such Ministers and for regulating their positions, and the details of provisions should be referred to a Committee of the Dail to be nominated by the Ministry to consider and report to the Dail.  In Article 52 it is proposed that the Committee should be a &ldquo;Committee of Members of the Chamber/Dail Eireann chosen by a method to be determined by the Chamber/Dail, so as to be impartially representative of the Chamber/Dail; such Ministers shall be chosen with due regard to their suitability for office.&rdquo;  Now Article 53, about ten lines down, says:&mdash;&ldquo;The term of office of any such Minister shall be the term of the Chamber/Dail Eireann existing at the time of his appointment, or such other period as may be fixed by law.&rdquo;  Between all these different proposals you have possible Ministers appointed, should this motion be carried, by a Committee of the Dail nominated by the Government.  On the other hand, you would have the Dail, if Article 52 were carried, enabled to appoint a Committee, which Committee will itself appoint Ministers, and if 53 were passed you would have legislation possibly carried under which these Ministers might have a term of office different from the Dail or the rest of the Ministry. 
     
    
      
       The Committee provided for in the motion before the Dail is a Committee which would suggest back to the Dail machinery for the appointment of these Ministers or for the carrying out of the principle which is embodied in the resolution.  It would therefore supersede 52, 53, 54 and 55. 
     
    
      
       Would not the resolution be subject to the provision of Article 53, &ldquo;that the term of office of Ministers might be changed?&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       The Committee to be appointed by the Dail, if this resolution were carried, would make suggestions to the Dail, which would supersede all those. 
     
    
      
       All the other Articles? 
     
     
    
      
       That is the understanding clearly. 
     
    
      
       I am glad you have given that instruction, because, according to that, 52, 53, 54, 55, and possibly, I am not quite sure about 56, but certainly the other five Articles, will all disappear, subject to what new suggestions the Committee set up may propose to the Dail. 
     
    
      
       That was exactly what was arranged&mdash;that the Committee would report to the Dail, and that we would defer these Articles now and consider them on the report of the Committee. 
     
    
      
       I should be very glad to vote for such a Committee on the lines just laid down by Deputy Whelehan, which would refer all these five Articles, and possibly the sixth, to such a Committee, if that suggestion that we don't adopt the principle could be knocked out of this resolution, so that the whole matter would be considered openly by such a Committee of the whole Dail.  I would be very glad to have such a Committee if the idea of a Committee of that nature could be accepted by the Government, so that this whole question, which everybody can see is very involved in its nature and its implications, which really require a great deal of thinking out, could be considered. There are possibilities that in a discussion in a Committee things would be seen more clearly than in one day's debate in the Dail.  If such a Committee could be set up, it would be by far the best way to deal with this whole subject. Undoubtedly there are very serious objections to our supporting it, if such conditions as these for setting up a Ministry were imposed.  There have been so many arguments already used against the appointment of some men, who might be appointed in this way, that very few are left; but there is one very important one, that seems to me not to have been touched upon.  It is quite possible that under this system a Minister defeated at an election could be reappointed by the Dail or by the Government through the Committee of the Dail, and he might be reappointed, although he might have been defeated at an election and rejected by his constituents.  There is nothing to stop this Minister from being reappointed in this way.  There is nothing to stop the   head of one of the Departments, a Civil Servant or a junior in one of the Departments, being appointed&mdash;a man who has been under the authority of the Dail&mdash; over the Dail.  Undoubtedly these Ministers would have far more independent control than Ministers who are actually representative of the Dail and subject to the daily intercourse in the Dail in a way that one of these nominated men would not be.  Another very strong objection to it was pointed out by Deputy Fitzgibbon and others, that although not members of the Dail those men would still be the controlling body over the finances of the nation; if seven or eight of them were nominated you would have a two to one majority of men controlling the entire finances of the nation against the elected deputies who were members of the Executive Council, and then on the other hand if these men were not on the Executive Council, then you would have another evil.  You would have the whole of the finance of the nation under the control of the four remaining members of the Executive Council, and I think it would be a very undesirable thing, that all proposals in regard to finance, should emanate from only the four members who were members of the Executive Council, who were also members of the Dail.  I do not believe this thing can possibly be workable, and I think human nature will always be exactly the same as it has been.  If a man has thought or desire to serve his country to the best of his powers and to place at its disposal his services, in 99 cases out of 100 he will find his way into public life, and will probably find his way into the Dail, or be nominated to the Senate.  Professional men who have given themselves up to the pursuit of Art and Science may, some of them, be desirable in the Government.  Now and again they will find themselves on the way to the Dail or the Senate.  The Senate has a large membership of 180 or more, and if 12 men cannot be got out of so many who would be fit to join the Ministry and take control of affairs, then we will be writing ourselves down as a hopeless lot and justifying the argument of those who say we are not fit for self-government. 
     
    
      
       Up to the time the Minister for Home Affairs spoke I myself and the majority of deputies were under the impression that the basic   principle we were discussing was that of individual responsibility of Ministers. On that question I gather from the speeches there is very little difference of opinion.  My mind is made up in favour of having a large number of the Ministers with individual responsibilities, but I cannot see that there is any necessary connection between the question of individual responsibility of members and the question of &ldquo;in and out Ministers.&rdquo;  Unless I am mistaken in the French Chamber there are a certain number of Ministers who have individual responsibilities.  Most of the speakers have been rather definitely opposed to the provision that a certain number of Ministers, more particularly the majority, should not be members of the Dail, but most of the speakers, so far as they have expressed the opinion on that point, have been in favour of individual responsibility of Ministers.  It would be a good thing if we could disentangle these two principles and vote on them separately. I think the result would be different to what you would get by embodying the two in one resolution.  My mind is made up in favour of having individual responsibility on the part of Ministers in charge of certain departments, such as Agriculture, Education, Local Government, and matters of that kind, but I favour the proposition that some Ministers need not be members of the Dail.  I quite see certain circumstances where individual Ministers would be a success as heads of departments, and through purely local circumstances might fail to retain their seats in the Dail.  A few years ago Sir Horace Plunkett had to give up his position as head of the Department of Agriculture because he could not retain his seat in the House of Commons.  Most of the people in this country thought that he was a success in that position, and that it was unfortunate he could not retain it, and not be obliged to make way for a place hunter.  I think the resolution ought to be amended, and have two separate votes taken on these two principles: the question of individual responsibility, and the question as to whether a Minister should, or should not, be a member of the Dail.  I am in favour of permitting a certain number of Ministers, more particularly if that number do not make a majority of the Ministry. 
     
     
    
      
       I did not intend to speak, but I do think it necessary to point out that it seems to be very difficult indeed to keep our thoughts to the one principle to which I was wishing to draw attention.  There are certain restrictions in the clause.  It was just that we might not be affected in our judgment on the main point, that I suggested the appointment of a committee.  The proposal seems to me to have many difficulties in it, but I think the Government were entitled to get from the Dail at this stage a definite and clear expression of opinion as to whether they would consent, under any terms to having as Ministers some persons who had not been elected as members of the Dail.  If that were put forward in that form merely, somebody would immediately raise the question, are they to be appointed by the Government themselves, or will they be selected by this Dail?  It is for that reason I added a restrictive clause that such members be elected or nominated by the Dail. With that restriction the Dail itself gets control.  I fail to see reason in the claim that we are showing a lack of confidence in the people so long as the Dail itself has the appointment of the Ministers. If the nominations were in the hands of one person, then these points that have been urged as objections to this I suggest might very reasonably be put forward. As long as the Dail itself keeps control of those whom they nominate to the office the objections could not reasonably apply.  The arguments put forward were arguments against detail, not arguments on the main point that there should not be any Minister who is not a member of this Dail.  The Committee, if appointed, as I trust it will be, will take good care that these proposals, when they come back to us, shall guard against the dangers apprehended.  Now, I would myself be very glad to give that Committee a completely free hand in the whole decision as to what is to be done regarding the Executive Council. It is perfectly easy to get a definite decision on this question, and I think the Government are entitled to ask us to-day whether we will or will not have that thing.  It is before us for a long time, and it was before us long before we spoke here, and most of us had made up our minds as to whether we would permit it or not.  Personally, I think   it would be a very good thing.  It would avoid the dangers of Party Government, and would avoid the necessity of having an excessive number of permanent officials. I mention that because it was used as an argument against this by several speakers.  If you do not secure continuity by some such device as this you will have to secure it by the appointment of permanent officials in these Departments, as is done across the water, and that is a very expensive plan. This will save the Administration a considerable amount of money when we work out and establish our administration. I think the advantages are very substantial for that reason.  I think most of the objections urged are objections against details which it is the business of the Committee to deal with.  I only ask the Dail to do nothing more to-day than to say if there are certain restrictions, that the Ministers must be nominated by the Dail, and should be individually responsible for their own departments to the Dail&mdash;with these restrictions I ask the Dail to agree to allow the possibility, not mandatory at all, of there being at certain times certain Ministers who have not probably attempted to obtain a seat in this Dail.  Now there were two or three points mentioned to-day to which I wish to draw special attention.  The first one is a question of how many. That is a detail.  Nevertheless it is an important detail, and I fancy there are some who will say &ldquo;I will vote for this if I were certain there were not going to be too many, but as there is a danger of there being too many, I shall vote against it.&rdquo;  I feel absolutely certain the Committee would not come back to this Dail favouring more than a minority, and I agree there should be a minority of the Ministers capable of this position of not being elected members of the Dail.  I think if it is stated in an amendment that the number of such Ministers should be not more than a minority of the Ministry, I would accept that, and possibly if that were put forward it might be accepted without dissent.  An important point was raised by my colleague Deputy Fitzgibbon.  It was valuable in this way, that it puts the finger on a place to where we may have to go back to what has been done with regard to a previous part of the Constitution. That is what a later reading is for,   to give the opportunity of modifying previous clauses.  Now I want to get the Dail clear as to the Executive Council. We are to have an Executive Council of twelve.  In Article 36 the Executive Council are to have certain powers, and in Article 54 it is stated that the Executive Council are to have collective authority.  It does not say that each member of the Executive Council of 12 should have an equal voice in the decisions of the Council.  It was always intended that decisions on finance should be come to by the body with collective responsibility, and if decisions were overruled by the Dail it would involve the resignation of only those responsible, and not involve the resignation of all.  That is one of the points I want the Committee to deal with, because I think it is a point that requires immediate consideration. We may have to revise some of what we did with reference to the Executive Council in the previous Article.  Now, the Committee may say, While your Executive Council consists of 12 members, you have to decide that a certain number of them, say 8, should act as a body to decide any questions coming before this Dail, and the others may act with them in a consulting capacity, and need not have a voice in deciding what is to come before this Dail.  I think that would be a reasonable way of proceeding.  I do ask the Dail to come to a decision on the one point &mdash;with certain restrictions, while keeping control in the Dail over abuses.  In that way the Dail, and through the Dail, the people, may have Ministers who have not submitted themselves to the suffrage of the people.  The amendment allows us to avoid the necessity for any Minister who has been chosen from this Dail being thrown back on his constituency.  It may be advisable in certain cases, but the amendment does not bring that in.  I ask the Dail to give a decision on the question, will you or will you not allow of the possibility of having at some time or another Ministers who have never been elected by the people to sit in this Dail? 
     
    
      
       I ask the mover of this resolution will he suggest these words in his resolution?:&mdash;(The resolution says:&mdash;&ldquo;That this House approves of the general principle of the proposal that certain members of Executive Council   nominated by the Dail, and individually responsible to the Dail alone for the Departments respectively under their charge, need not be members of the Dail,&rdquo; and so on) now, I ask the mover if he would insert after &ldquo;proposal,&rdquo;&ldquo;that certain Ministers who shall not be members of the Executive Council,&rdquo; and then go on with the rest of the resolution? That is, that these nominated people who are not members of the Dail shall not be members of the Executive Council? 
     
    
      
       I have an amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;That the word &ldquo;certain&rdquo; be deleted in line 2 of the resolution, and that the words &ldquo;a minority of&rdquo; be inserted.  I will accept that amendment if any Deputy proposes it? 
     
    
      
       I move that. 
     
    
      
       I would like to make a suggestion.  What I would say is this, that Article 50 should be sent to a Committee of the Dail without prejudice, one way or another, to our case, that the Article in the light of the discussion that has taken place here in order to try to bring it to something of the nature that will remove the objections that have been voiced here.  I suggest that you send it to a committee for re-drafting. 
     
    
      
       On a point of order, Sir, I ask you for your ruling on this&mdash;whether the suggestion that has been put forward by Deputy Milroy might be put to the Dail. 
     
    
      
       That is not a point of order. 
     
    
      
       What I ask is whether the proposal he puts forward is not the only proposal that can be practicable, for this reason&mdash;suppose the Committee were to adopt a form of words that did not embody the principle recommended in the debate, would you rule it out of order? 
     
    
      
       That is a hypothetical question, and I am not here for answering hypothetical questions, because they can be innumerable. I will ask the Clerk to read the motion as it would now appear. 
     
    
      
       read the motion as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;That this House approves, as a general principle, of the proposal that a minority of the members of the Executive Council nominated by   the Dail, and individually responsible to the Dail alone for the Departments respectively under their charge, need not be members of the Dail, and that the details of the provisions for appointing such Ministers and for regulating their position should be referred to a Committee of the House, to be nominated by the Ministry, for consideration and report to the House.  That the consideration of their Report should come before the House later whilst in Committee on the present Bill.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       Is it understood that Deputy Fitzgibbon has moved his second amendment?  If so, I will second it. 
     
    
      
       If you get your colleague to withdraw his. 
     
    
      
       I have the amendment proposed by Deputy Davin, and amendments in Committee do not require to be seconded. 
     
    
      
       Would not Deputy Davin withdraw his amendment in favour of Mr. Fitzgibbon's? 
     
    
      
       I am quite prepared to do so, if the words I want are inserted. 
     
    
      
       I think mine meets what Deputy Davin wanted; that is, to add to the terms of the resolution the proposal that certain Ministers shall not be members of the Executive Council nominated by the Dail. 
     
    
      
       Did you say &ldquo;shall not&rdquo;? 
     
    
      
       Yes. 
     
    
      
       Well, I will vote against &ldquo;shall&rdquo; every time. 
     
    
      
       The words are &ldquo;shall not,&rdquo; Mr. Gorey. 
     
    
      
       I am not satisfied that Mr. Fitzgibbon's amendment makes it quite clear that the majority of the members of the Executive will be members of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       Deputy Davin's amendment is the amendment before us, and unless it is withdrawn another amendment cannot be taken. 
     
    
      
       Can you tell me whether I would be allowed to move the deletion of the word &ldquo;Ministry&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dail&rdquo;?  I think we   ought have that done by the Dail and not by the Ministry.  That is, the nomination should be by the Dail and not by the Ministry. 
     
    
      
       Will the Deputy vote for the motion if that is done? 
     
    
      
       Is it impossible to hope that the Ministry will not consent to have this matter sent to a Committee, to have it re-cast? 
     
    
      
       That is a further amendment. 
     
    
      
       I am not proposing it.  I am speaking of the amendment before the Dail. 
     
    
      
       I cannot withdraw until it is quite clear that the majority of the Executive Council is composed of members of this Chamber. 
     
    
      
       My amendment makes it perfectly clear that there will be no one on the Executive Council who is not a member of this Dail.  All of them must be members of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       That makes it perfectly clear. 
     
    
      
       The Dail is not going to get any further until this thing is got in order. 
     
    
      
       It is hard to keep some things in order. 
     
    
      
       The most difficult thing to keep in order in this Dail is the Deputy who has spoken. 
     
    
      
       But he is always to the point. 
     
    
      
       Deputy Davin's amendment is before the Dail. He is moving an amendment substituting for the word &ldquo;certain&rdquo;&ldquo;a majority of the members.&rdquo; 
     
    
      
       I take it that I am entitled to speak on that amendment. I do not know that it would be wise to adopt this.  The suggestion that has been made by Deputy Fitzgibbon would leave it unnecessary to adopt this.  The amendment you were discussing a while ago would leave it unnecessary to secure the point that Deputy Davin has in his mind&mdash;to ensure that the minority of the members would be outside of the Executive Council.  It would take some time to explain that, I think.  If the various   services require the services of Ministers who are not members of the Dail&mdash; that is, if there be more services which require members who are not members of the Dail, more services which would require a clear vote of the Dail, a free vote of the Dail, apart from the parties and groups in the Dail, there would be danger in adopting Deputy Davin's suggestion.  For example, if a number of services which actually require the members of the Dail to be Ministers responsible for policy, and so on, is a minority of the services, and that the responsibility of the Executive as far as these members were concerned is quite distinct and clear, then there would really be no useful purpose served in having a minority, because you would include in the group of political matters services which are not essentially political, and these services then would not be free for discussion in the Dail.  The real purpose which was behind this whole intention would be defeated.  Now, I was rather struck with what we call the infirmities of the case that has been made against the proposal.  One of the Deputies stated that, in the case of a man rejected at the elections being put up for the Ministry here, there would be nothing to stop him being elected a Minister.  I think that case suffers very much by having it exaggerated&mdash;that is true here as elsewhere.  The Minister to be nominated has got to be recommended by the Committee, which is impartially representative of the whole Assembly.  If this rejected individual runs the gauntlet of being nominated by such a Committee, which in essence is a fraction of the entire Dail, he has still got to be elected by the Dail before he will reach Ministerial preferment.  There is the security there, and every man on that Committee has the responsibility cast on him in appointing him, and they will bear in mind whether it was by reason of any serious act of his he was really rejected at the poll, so that I take it that the nomination in the first place by this impartial Committee, representative of the entire Dail, and the subsequent election of the man will secure that the person so appointed will be a fit and proper person for the office.  There were other cases mentioned&mdash;Grattan's Parliament, where we were reminded, that Ministers were nominated.  I would   like to know if the Dail were inclined to think that the Committee of the House nominated those Ministers to the House, and that the House subsequently elected them.  That certainly, whether it was intended to lead the Dail to believe that, was the impression conveyed, though I scarcely think it was intended.  But there are innocent members in this Dail who might have concluded from the way the case was put that that was the machinery that was adopted.  Those of us who are not so innocent know that it was not the case. Some cases were mentioned, of other countries not having adopted this system, and I think it was fairly clear why they had not done so.  There are vested interests in representative Government, and where there is continuity of Government and where stable conditions exist for a great number of years this particular experiment is unnecessary. We know, each of us who have run the gauntlet of elections, the various disadvantages of standing for a constituency.  I think Mr. Dooley, the celebrated American humorist, speaking to a friend in this matter, said he would have to look up his genealogy before he would consent to allow himself to be nominated for any position, because, he said, a remote ancestor of his might possibly have misconducted himself, and it would be a great shock to him at the election to hear it for the first time.  Now, there is objection made to the fact that the Dail by a single vote is not in a position to exclude the Minister.  Is that fair?  I think it is perfectly fair.  A snatch vote at a given moment might jeopardise a very brilliant and promising Minister&mdash;a very honest Minister.  The proposal here is that a snatch vote would not put such a Minister out of office, and this impartial Committee would, in fact, try that Minister and report to the Dail; and I expect a fuller institution would hear the complaint than the institution which rejected or gave the snatch vote against him.  There were other cases mentioned against this proposal. That was that the political boss might exercise overwhelming influence and might ram any Minister here, whether the Nation wanted him or not. During the last 5, 6 or 7 years I think we have not had any experience of political bosses.  The Press was also mentioned&mdash;that   the Press might stunt for political Ministers.  The Press has not been particularly active, or, at least, was not a very great asset in the fight during the last five or six years.  The Press had to be fought during that period.  I think from the beginning of the Rebellion of 1916 very few newspapers supported that action, although a great many of those in political life at the moment think the movement started from that period.  So it had to start against the Press, and I do not think the Press as powerful an instrument in this country as the Deputy thinks. There was also talk of a trust affecting us.  There is no big trust that I know that would have any such effect on people outside, or on the people in this Dail.  It is mentioned that this is not a democratic proposal.  Under the old Constitution of the Dail, the President came along here and nominated his Ministers, and in essence, if you rejected that nomination of the President, you practically rejected the President.  In this case you restrict the President's autocracy to a certain number, and the Dail gets an opportunity of putting up the others.  From my point of view, I think there is very much more to be said for that than for the individual, and my recollection of a previous Parliament is, speaking for myself, and I think for one or two others, that not one of them knew they were going to be nominated for these particular positions at the particular time.  Now, it was intended here that the Ministry of Finance, at all events, would be one of four, and, as I said last night, I do not agree with four only being members of the Executive Council.  It ought to be much larger. The Ministries we have in mind are Finance, External Affairs, Defence, and Home Affairs, so that there is no need for any misgiving regarding extern Ministers bringing up proposals to the Dail without the responsibility of the Executive Council.  It might not generally be known what are the fundamentals of Government finance, or Local Government finance, and the member who spoke about Local Government finance, I think, must not have very exact knowledge of its ramifications.  Rates are struck for specific purposes, and it is not open to a Local Authority to spend more on a particular purpose than is raised in   rates.  It does not exactly mean you cannot exceed it by a single penny, but it must be kept within that ambit, and if you raise rates for poor-law, you cannot spend them on asylums or police.  I think we demonstrated that at some great difficulty and not a little trouble during the last two or three years, when laws were passed in another place, leaving open to decree-holders for criminal malicious injuries funds that were not actually raised for that purpose, so that there is no point in that argument so far as that business is concerned.  With regard to the suggestion of Deputy Byrne that this be referred to a Committee to be nominated by the Dail, I wanted to know, if we put that in, would the Deputy vote for it.  That is a fair question, because as far as the Ministry is concerned it is not making this&mdash;this matter is free to the Dail.  But if the principle be adopted that is mentioned here, it is certainly our business to see that the persons appointed to consider that and make it workable and useful, and to save the time of the Dail, would be persons sympathetically concerned with it.  In the ordinary way I would have no objection to having this matter, this particular proposal, put to an impartial Committee of the Dail.  You can see in this matter parties do not arise, and the necessity, which in the ordinary way will arise, for having an impartial Committee does not really arise in this case, because there is a certain entanglement here that has got to be worked out.  It was not mentioned here, I think, by those who criticised this proposal, and said it was not a proposition that was in operation in any part of the world, that Messrs. Hughes and Hoover, two of President Harding's most respected Ministers, are not members of either House.  Of course it may be a lapse, but I would imagine that the constitutional expert would have recollected that.  The point with regard to this is, that unless there be some permission given for this particular principle in the Constitution it cannot subsequently be embodied, or at least it cannot be acted on by a future Ministry. This Ministry has, I think, a very modest appreciation of its own abilities. They do not think for a moment that the Ministry is indispensable.  Personally, from what I know of them, they would be rather glad to return to the   usual walks of life that they were engaged in.  We know the diffidence with which certain people looked upon election. We know people who would render service to the State, but would not stand for elections.  We know also that if they did stand they would be elected.  I have not any particular person in my mind.  Even it has been put up to us in the last three or four years that certain people would do work, and we have certainly nobody in mind at the present moment to bring into the Dail if this were passed and the Saorstat were set up to-morrow.  It ought to be a matter for this Committee to settle. First of all I think there is general acceptance of the individual responsibility. Then the question is whether this permission ought to be given.  I think it ought.  I do not think it ought to be necessary, although I rather approve of it that members so appointed from the Dail to what we call extern Ministries shall be bound to resign their seats. I think it would be rather a good thing if they did, but we would not be bound. This Committee can settle that point. This is really a most vital thing for us, and there is no waste of time in spreading out the discussion of it. 
     
    
      
       I think I can speak upon this amendment. 
     
    
      
       I do not think you can, because you have already spoken. 
     
    
      
       The amendment is quite a different thing. 
     
    
      
       The amendment is not quite a different thing. 
     
    
      
       It is a most extraordinary ruling. 
     
    
      
       The amendment is directed against a particular thing in the motion.  It does not affect the principle of the motion on which you have spoken three times and protested four times. 
     
     
    
      
       And I am prepared to do the same all over again. 
     
    
      
       May I say one or two things in reply? 
     
    
      
       Yes.  We will put the amendment then when you have finished. 
     
    
      
       I merely wish to draw the attention of the Dail to the fact that we have disposed of Article 50 up to a certain point, up to line 11.  In that part of the Article already disposed of it says that &ldquo;there shall be a Council to aid and advise in the Government of the Irish Free State/Saorstat Eireann to be styled &lsquo;The Executive Council/ Aireacht.&rsquo;  The Executive Council shall be responsible to the Chamber/Dail Eireann.&rdquo;  My contention in moving this amendment is that the majority of that Executive that is going to be held responsible to this Dail should be elected members of the Dail.  I hope the Dail will appreciate that in spite of anything the President has said in opposition to it.  I do not think there is anything further to deal with, only I hope the Dail will, at any rate, by passing this amendment establish the fact that whatever Executive Council is set up under the Constitution of the Irish Free State that it will at any rate be a majority responsible to this Dail for all its action and will not, I hope, be influenced in any way by a majority of that Council who are not responsible to the people of this country. 
     
    
      
       Has Deputy Fitzgibbon handed in his amendment? 
     
    
      
       No. 
     
    
      
       My amendment is:&mdash;&ldquo;That this House approves as a general principle of the proposal that certain Ministers who shall not be members of the Executive Council need not be members of the Dail.&rdquo; 
       Amendment put: &ldquo;That the word &lsquo;certain&rsquo; be deleted and that the words &lsquo;minority of&rsquo; be inserted in line 11 of Deputy Thrift's amendment.&rdquo;

     Amendment declared lost. 
    
      
       Would it be in order at this point to ask the Government if there will be any reply to a query put once or twice during the discussion asking if the whole subject matter of the Clauses 50 to 56 would be referred to a Committee to report to the Dail without committing the Dail to anything, the Committee to be representative of the whole Dail? 
     
    
      
       Our feeling is that this Constitution is a sufficiently long time before the Dail and before the people to enable Deputies to have examined it, and we would not accept that.  We want a decision on the principle of these Executive proposals, and we are willing to leave details to be reported on by the Committee. 
     
    
      
       Deputy Fitzgibbon's amendment will now be considered. 
     
    
      
       I have said all that I have to say in support of it, and I am not going to say it all over again.  The only principle that the Dail is committed to by my amendment is that there may be certain heads of Ministries who are not members of this Dail; but it safeguards the whole Dail from being committed in any way to recognition of people who are not Members of this Dail, as on the Executive Council.  The Executive Council runs finances and runs the general policy of the country, and I am entirely opposed to having people on that Council who are not Members of the Dail.  I am in favour of the principle that certain people who may not be Members of this Dail, but who have special qualifications, may be made subordinate heads of Ministries.  They will be consulted by the Executive Council on matters dealing with their own concerns, but they will have no voice in the general policy of the country.

     Motion, as amended, declared carried. 
    
      
       As a matter of procedure the motion which is carried provides for the nomination of a Committee by the Ministry.  The nominations will have to come before the Dail and the Dail will have to go out of Committee to deal with the matter. 
     
    
      
       I have ten nominated. I have not asked any of them if they will act.  The names I have are:&mdash; Deputies Fitzgibbon, Thrift, Johnson, Davin, Gavan Duffy, O'Connell, Gorey, McGoldrick, Sears and D. McCarthy; quorum&mdash;five members; terms of reference&mdash;Resolution as amended and adopted, with Articles 50 and 59 of the Constitution, with power to examine witnesses and report by Tuesday, 10th inst. 
     
    
      
       I think the terms of reference might, perhaps, be made more clear. 
     
    
      
       It is embodied in the resolution, and I do not like to go outside it. 
     
    
      
       The resolution is not the terms of reference all the same.  It is really to arrange the details of the provisions for appointing Ministers who shall not be members of the Executive Council, and need not be members of the Dail, but shall be nominated by the Dail, and be actually responsible to the Dail for their Departments. Those are the exact terms of reference. 
     
    
      
       Very good. 
     
    
      
       Tuesday is rather short.  I would say rather towards the end of the week. 
     
    
      
       Could we not say Wednesday, and let the Committee report to us if they like on Wednesday? 
     
    
      
       Do you mean that we should have to stay over for the weekend? 
     
    
      
       The position is that with the determination of this motion of Deputy Professor Thrift   all the clauses in that particular section are deferred&mdash;that is to say, from 50 (b) to 59, inclusive.  We can proceed with the rest, and we actually have on the Orders Paper up to 71.  These could be taken on a day to be arranged next week, and we could then come back to these particular clauses. 
       The motion was put and declared carried. 
     
    
      
       In order to appoint a Committee we should formally make a report from Committee to the Dail itself. 
     
    
      
       When is it proposed this Committee will meet? 
     
    
      
       It will meet for the first time when the Dail rises to-night. 
     
    
      
       May I make a suggestion that it might help the Committee if the President were to nominate one of these persons as Convener of the Committee? 
     
    
      
       If that be agreeable, I will propose the first name on the list, Deputy Fitzgibbon. 
     
     
    
      
       It is agreed that Deputy Fitzgibbon be Convener. The Dail will now go out of Committee. 
     
   
   
     DAIL RESUMES. 
    
      
       It is reported from the Committee of the whole Dail that it desires to appoint a Committee of their number with the terms of reference as specified. 
     
    
      
       I now formally move that the Committee be appointed. 
     
    
      
       I second the motion. 
       Question put and agreed to. 
     
    
      
       Before the Minister proceeds, could it be agreed that the Constitutional amendments be not proceeded with to-night?  There are Ministerial motions, and I fancy they will take the remaining time. 
     
    
      
       We do not propose to go further with the Constitution to-day.

             4.  Feadfar an Reacht so do luadh chun gach criche mar Reacht an Rialtais Shealadaigh (Diobhail Choiriuil) Uimh. 10, 1922. 
             4.  This Decree may be cited for all purposes as the Provisional Government (Criminal Injuries) Decree No. 10, 1922.&rdquo; 
           
         
       
     
     
    
      
       The resolution which I have down to propose is one asking the Dail to sanction and approve of a Decree which was made by the Provisional Government a couple of days ago.  That Decree was made necessary because of the fact that it was brought to our knowledge that certain people were proceeding in the Courts for the purpose of garnisheeing rates for debts due by Local Authorities.  The members of the Dail will remember that there was an Act passed by the British Parliament in 1920 which gave power to persons who had obtained Decrees for Malicious Injuries &ldquo;irrespective of the amount recovered, be removed to the High Court on  certiorari  under Section nine of the Civil Bill Courts Procedure Amendment Act (Ireland), 1864, and any rates payable by any ratepayer to the Council may, as well as any other debts due to the Council, be attached to answer the amount recovered by the decree when so removed, together with the costs of or incidental to the proceedings in the High Court, including the costs of the removal.&rdquo;  That Act was a war measure, a Penal Act, designed not so much to recover costs for the people, to recover damages, or the amounts for people who had obtained these decrees, but for the purpose of crippling the entire machinery of Local Government.  The powers given in that Act were not much availed of. Some people were afraid to avail of them, others had a degree of decency which prevented them availing of them. Now if any considerable number of people were to take advantage of the changed circumstances to proceed under this Act to recover from the ratepayers the amount of rates due, and were to take from the treasurer the money coming to the County Council, the results would be serious. The position of the local bodies is pretty bad on account of the difficulty of recovering rates.  If the penal powers given in   this British Act of 1920 were used against the Councils, undoubtedly the whole machinery would be thrown into chaos. The Provisional Government in pursuance of the general powers given it under the Treaty has restricted the application of the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Act, and for the purpose of giving further sanction to that decree, has intimated to any people who might have proceeded under this section, that they will be compelled to disgorge.  If they were successful in mulcting the local bodies in this way, we ask the local bodies to give sanction and approval to this decree. I do not think the matter is one about which there can be a great deal of controversy. As the President explained, the local bodies strike rates and estimates, and if people were to be allowed to come in under this Penal Law passed in 1920, and seize the rates levied, financial confusion would result.  In the present circumstances if such a thing were to happen the local government would go to pieces altogether.  It is necessary the Government should take all the steps in its power to prevent such a thing occurring. 
     
    
      
       I second the motion.  One part of that may be misinterpreted.  Lord Shaw's Commission is still in existence.  As far as the people under that Commission are concerned, they still retain those rights. 
     
    
      
       I am greatly relieved to hear the explanation of the Minister for Local Government, when I understand from him that this is a decree issued to meet an emergency, and that it was necessary to proceed before bringing this matter to the Dail. I was afraid that it was one of those cases where the act was committed, and then permission to commit it was to be asked for afterwards.  In the circumstances I can offer no objection to the motion. 
       The motion was carried.

             The period during which the said regulations shall apply shall be extended to the date of the constitution of the Government of the Irish Free State or the sixth day of December, 1922, whichever shall be the sooner, and the said above mentioned proviso shall be amended accordingly by substituting for the words &ldquo;and for a month thereafter&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and until the sixth day of December, 1922, or the constitution of the Government of the Irish Free State, whichever shall be the sooner.&rdquo; 
           
         
       
     
    
      
       The resolution which I now submit to the Dail asks for approval of a certain change of the regulations which have heretofore governed the issue of funds out of the Exchequer for defraying the cost of the public services.  To explain this matter briefly I may say that the effective and formal transfer of financial functions from the British Government took place on the 1st April last.  On that day the Exchequer of the Provisional Government was constituted. Into it were paid from that day forward all taxes collected in the area of jurisdiction of the Provisional Government, and out of it were issued the sums required for maintaining the public services. 
       In the normal course the issue of funds for public services must necessarily be authorised by more or less detailed enactments of the Legislature.  It has not, of course, been possible as yet to deal with the financial business of this country on these settled lines, and until the Constitution of the Irish Free State can come into operation, procedure of an emergency character is inevitable. 
       At first, therefore, it was provided by regulations made by the Provisional Government that the authority for the ordinary issue of funds out of the Exchequer should in the case of a given Department, be a certificate signed by the Minister in charge of the Department, and where that Minister was not the Minister for Finance, the certificate was required to be approved by the Minister for Finance.  This arrangement was made in the first instance for a period which was intended to end on the expiration of a month after the meeting of this Dail, that is on the 8th of this month. In present circumstances, while the Constitution still awaits adoption, it is considered impracticable to terminate the arrangement on that date, and, therefore, the amended regulation now submitted for approval aims at extending the temporary scheme up to the date on which the Government of the Irish Free State is constituted, or the 6th December next, whichever is sooner. The 6th December, as the Dail is aware, will be the anniversary of the Treaty and the date of expiration of the arrangement made by the Treaty for a Provisional Government. 
     
     
        In adopting the extension which I have explained, the Government have thought it proper at the same time to abandon the discretion which up to this has necessarily remained with them as to the amounts of the Exchequer issues, for which Ministers may certify.  The resolution which I propose consequently contains a proviso to the effect that the aggregate amount which under the temporary procedure may be issued out of the Exchequer in respect of Supply Services for the period from the 1st April last to a date not later than the 6th December next, shall not exceed £18,953,475.  If any issues for the services in question should seem to be required in excess of this amount during the period mentioned, it is proposed to submit the matter to the Dail for previous consideration.  That, I think, should be in accordance with the views of Deputies generally and of their constituents outside. 
     At this stage I do not propose to say anything further on the somewhat technical though important features of the resolution with which I have so far been dealing, as I wish to take the opportunity of laying before Deputies such information as I think may be of use, and as they will probably desire to have regarding the figure of nearly nineteen millions mentioned in the resolution and other figures which have a bearing upon it. The figure in the resolution represents the estimated cost of the ordinary public service in the twenty-six Counties during the period from the 1st April last to the 6th December next.  It has had to be prepared somewhat hurriedly by the Ministry of Finance which is working at great pressure.  Necessarily, owing to the disturbance arising from the change of Government and other difficult conditions of these times, estimates are not as easily framed as when a settled Government is working on established lines.  But even allowing for such factors, it may be taken that the figure given is a reasonable approximation to expenditure that will probably be required. 
     In a paper which has been circulated, the details which make up the total of £18,953,475 are set out according to the several services to which they relate, and in addition, figures are given showing the estimated provision required for the same services for the full financial year from 1st April, 1922, to 31st March, 1923.   The aggregate for the full year is £37,709,586.  For comparison with these figures the Dail will, no doubt, be interested to have a statement of the sums issued from the Exchequer for the like services for the half year ended Saturday last, the 30th September.  The issues in question for the half-year amount to a total of £9,544,044, the chief items being as follows:&mdash;

             252,500 
           
           
             Other issues of less than £250,000 each 
             2,573,700 
           
         
       
     
     Of course Deputies will understand that these figures of Exchequer issues for a given period are not an exact indication of expenditure for the period.  Some of the money issued out of the Exchequer will be in the hands of Departments or Officials and will not yet have been actually disbursed to defray public charges. On the other hand&mdash;and this is especially likely to happen in the transition state through which we have been passing&mdash; liabilities incurred in a given period will be outstanding to a certain extent at the end of a period.  To form a fair impression of the cost of the public services in the past half year some addition must probably be made on this account to the figure of nine and a half millions which I have given for Exchequer issues.  It will be one of our special aims as conditions get more settled to reduce the interval between the maturing of a liability and the discharge of it. 
     I will ask Deputies specially to bear in mind the figure of thirty-seven and three-quarter millions which is given on the paper as the net total of the estimate for 1922-23.  I regret to say that this does not represent the whole of our possible commitments for the year.  It covers the ordinary public service for which Parliaments as a rule provide money by annual vote.  But there are additional liabilities, actual, probable and possible, which must also be borne in mind.  Of these one important class consists of the fixed charges which are mandatory under existing law, chiefly certain local taxation   grants and the salaries and pensions of judges.  This class requires a provision of about £1,350,000.  Next are two items which are in the nature of capital charges, namely, £105,000 for Telephone development and over £600,000 to be advanced to meet an anticipated deficit in the Unemployment Fund.  In referring to this item I should like to call special attention to the fact that an abnormal burden is being imposed on the State at present to provide Unemployment Insurance benefit by reason of the omission of many persons to comply with the requirements as to stamping Unemployment Insurance cards.  It is essential that those concerned should realise their responsibilities in this connection and do their part towards the restoration of normal conditions and the support of stable government by discharging their obligations in this respect.  The situation in this matter has become such as to demand the strict enforcement of the penalties prescribed for non-compliance. 
     There remains the third category of cases in which claims are being made against us by the British Government in respect of charges under the Land Purchase Acts and other heads.  The amount involved here is perhaps a million a year.  Even excluding this amount as being in dispute, it will be seen that the estimated total sum required by the Government in the current financial year is only a little short of £40,000,000.  The payment of compensation claims in respect of damage before and after the Truce accounts for a quarter of this total.  Of course this is not anything like the entire or even the main part of the compensation liability, but only the provision which is expected to be required to meet payments that will actually be issued before the 1st April next.  Leaving compensation aside, we have to find perhaps £30,000,000 to defray the cost of ordinary government, including the Army for the current financial year.  What resources have the Government and the country at their disposal to meet this heavy burden? It must certainly be confessed that if the burden were to be a continuing burden and if the public and the Government by loyal co-operation in the establishment of order and other necessary measures do not reduce the public charges, we have not sufficient resources and can only see before us the prospect of following the path of financial and other folly,   which has brought several of the countries of Continental Europe to the condition of abject misery in which they now find themselves.  But there is no need for alarm or for taking dismal views if the growing sense of civic responsibility and patriotism brings our people to the realisation of the great economic and social prospects that lie before them provided that they turn while there is still time from destruction to construction. 
     I will ask Deputies to bear with me while I attempt to summarise the position in which we find ourselves respecting the finding of the funds that are necessary for public purposes. 
     The revenue actually received into the Exchequer for the half year from the 1st April up to and including Saturday last the 30th September, has been as follows:&mdash; 
     
       
         
         
         
         
         
           
             Customs 
             £1,097,000 
           
           
             Excise 
             7,885,000 
           
           
             Motor Vehicle Duties 
             Nil 
           
           
             Estate Duties 
             418,000 
           
           
             Stamps 
             161,000 
           
           
             Property and Income Tax (including Super-tax and Mineral Rights Duty) 
             1,119,000 
           
           
             Corporation Profits Tax 
             179,000 
           
           
             Excess Profit Tax 
             75,000 
           
           
             Post Office 
             350,000 
           
           
             Miscellaneous 
             180,107 
           
           
             Total 
             £11,464,107 
           
         
       
     
     This total figure of £11,464,107 represents the revenue actually collected into our Exchequer in the period mentioned. For various reasons, however, it cannot be taken as accurately representing the true revenue of the Irish Free State in the period. 
     For example, as regards the customs which is shown as providing £1,097,000 there are several foreign commodities such as tea which frequently come to us  via  Great Britain.  On landing at the British port they pay duty there, and although they come to Ireland for consumption the tax is credited in the first instance to Great Britain where it was in fact collected.  For this reason the Customs duty collected in our area and paid into our Exchequer does not represent the full Customs duty on the foreign goods which we consume. 
     To meet this point it has been arranged that the proceeds of any taxes collected in Great Britain or Northern Ireland   which are properly attributable to the Irish Free State shall be paid over in due course into our Exchequer.  No adjustment of this kind has in fact yet taken place and the figures which I have given represent the actual collection. 
     The figure I have given for Excise is £7,885,000 or over two-thirds of the total revenue.  The Excise which consists mainly of the duties on beer and spirits has long been a chief factor in Irish revenue.  But the amount of this duty collected here is largely in excess of the amount attributable to home consumption. In 1920-21 there was collected under this head in the whole of Ireland about 231⁄2 millions, but of this only 15 millions was treated as true Irish revenue.  The reason for this is, of course, that much of the output of our breweries and distilleries having paid duty here, is removed to Great Britain for consumption. 
     It will, therefore, be seen that of the £7,885,000 which we have collected under the head of Excise a substantial portion cannot be said to belong to us at all, and just as we must expect from Great Britain a supplementary payment in respect of customs, so on the other hand are we obliged to surrender that portion of our Excise receipts which cannot be regarded as pertaining to our own area. 
     The next head of revenue is Motor Vehicle Duties, for which a nil return is shown.  This does not mean that there has been no collection of tax under this head, but only that there is no tax collected which has yet reached the Exchequer. When the Provisional Government entered on their task they did not find in existence any operative machinery for the collection of this tax.  That state of affairs has since been rectified and proper arrangements have been made with the County Councils for the registration and licensing of motor vehicles and the payment of duty.  The receipts of this duty are at present lying to credit of outside accounts, and it is intended shortly to make a transfer to the Exchequer. 
     The heads of Estate Duties, Stamps and Corporation Profits Tax, which together have yielded £758,000 call for no special comment.  The receipt of £75,000 in respect of Excess Profits Tax represents an arrear for a past period.  It is well to have it made clear as regards arrears of tax generally that these are now   payable to our Exchequer and become the property of this Government.  There appears to be still a certain amount of misunderstanding about this, and a number of persons are understood to have hesitation in paying up arrears of Income Tax through a false impression that this country would not have the benefit of it. There is no longer any excuse for such an attitude. 
     The yield of Income Tax including Super Tax, has been £1,119,000.  This figure is probably three millions short of what it ought to be, especially as there were considerable arrears due on 1st April which are payable to our Exchequer. Now, however, that taxpayers are beginning to realise that the revenue they contribute goes directly to the Irish Exchequer and will be applied exclusively for purposes approved by the Dail, it may be expected that the hesitation which many honest people in this country have heretofore felt about meeting Income Tax demands will give way to a serious sense of public duty, and that this will be reflected in improved receipts under this head in future. 
     The figure of £350,000 given for Post Office revenue is only a payment on account in respect of the gross revenue of the Post Office.  There is no net revenue from this source. 
     The miscellaneous Revenue of £180,107 consists mainly of sums collected in respect of public loans previously advanced by the British Government.  In so far as such sums have subsequently to be surrendered to the British Exchequer in liquidation of the advances there is no net gain under this head. 
     It is a matter of much guesswork to form an Estimate of the full amount of our real revenue for the current financial year.  As a rough indication of the position it is perhaps not safe on present indications to count upon a total of more than £27,000,000, of which nearly £1,500,000 represents the gross Post Office Revenue. 
     Deputies can now draw their own conclusion from the figures I have laid before the Dail.  Without scrutinising smaller items which in other circumstances would be of much consequence they will, I am sure, appreciate the salient fact that the financial burden of enormous compensation charges and a great Army is one which has perhaps already strained the resources of the country to the danger point, and which has undoubtedly deprived   the country of the means by which great public benefits and reform might otherwise have been accomplished. 
     In conclusion, I have a few words to say on the subject of compensation, which is our greatest financial problem.  The arrangements for dealing with cases arising in the pre-Truce period, were, as is well known, settled by negotiations with the British Government.  Damage to property in the pre-Truce period, except where covered by decrees which were defended and which are payable in full, is being dealt with by the Shaw Commission, an international body not controlled by either Government singly.  The obligation of paying all the awards rests in the first instance with us but we are entitled to recover from the British Government the amounts awarded in cases where damage was done by their forces or in their interest. 
     Up to now the work of the Commission has necessarily been largely of a preliminary character, and in consequence no considerable volume of payments on foot of their awards has yet become due. The Commission has in fact reported seven awards, and they have recently intimated that they are about to report a further twenty-three.  With improved procedure and more extended provision for investigation, it is expected that the number of awards is on the point of expanding rapidly so that the burden on the Exchequer in the months immediately ahead should grow largely.  For this reason it has been found necessary to include in the paper which has been circulated a sum of £2,000,000 for payment of awards up to the 6th December next. 
     After that date and up to the 31st March next, as the paper indicates, a further large expansion of the provision for payment of awards is thought necessary.  This will result not alone from the increasing volume of awards by the Shaw Commission but from the determination which should then have been made of a large number of awards in respect of post-Truce damage.  On this question of post-Truce damage which is occasioning great anxiety to a wide circle of sufferers, I am in a position to say that a comprehensive scheme for dealing with claims is now in an advanced state of preparation and will, I hope, be announced at a very early date.  The Government have accordingly thought it   well to ask that the ordinary malicious injury claims due for hearing at Sessions now proceeding should be adjourned, it being anticipated that provision for dealing with these claims on the new basis will shortly be available. 
     In view of the serious liability arising in respect of compensation claims, generally, it will be necessary to take every practicable step to secure the maximum economy in the administration of the Public Services, and therefore, when the Dail is now being asked to give its approval to a vote on account of some nineteen millions, it is the intention of the Ministry to endeavour in so far as they can to reduce the requirements of Public Departments below this amount wherever it is found feasible.  It will be understood that on this account many proposals for public expenditure, which at another time might deserve favourable consideration, will now need to be rejected or deferred on grounds of financial stringency. 
    
      
       I beg formally to second the motion. 
     
    
      
       A Chinn Chomhairle, I feel great difficulty in dealing, in any way, with the statement that the President&mdash;or shall I say the Minister for Finance&mdash;has just made to us. I did gather from the Order in Council that a month should elapse after the opening of Parliament before the financial statement should be discussed.  I rather hoped that within one month after that opening an opportunity would be given to discuss any question arising out of the financial position of any particular Department, but we have a motion put before us to-day asking that the one month's grace should be extended for another two months&mdash;or a shorter time, if the Constitution Bill passes.  I do not expect it means any shorter time at all. because when the Constitution shall have passed through this Dail and the British House, and the new State shall have been formally set up, the time would have elapsed to carry us beyond the 6th of December.  I rather gather it is not the intention to encourage any discussion upon the various items of this paper.  I think the Minister for Finance is not to be congratulated upon his audience.  The financial watch-dogs who are supposed to be very keen on economies are not present.  Quite apart from the members   of the Ministry, the number of his own supporters who heard his statement was very small indeed.  I think the public will want to know why the Minister should be allowed to deal with so important a statement with so little attention from the elected members.  Probably they will all read this to-morrow morning, and I have no doubt will be very anxious to say things, but I rather guess from the attitude of the Minister that he intends this to pass through to-night.  Then their day will be done, and their opportunity will be lost.  There are two or three questions that I would like to raise, if it is possible, on this motion.  They refer to the various items that are on this estimate.  I note that &ldquo;No. 22, Ministry of Agriculture&mdash; £320,000&rdquo; is estimated as the requirements for eight months.  For the succeeding four months only £87,000 was suggested. The members for the agricultural constituencies are not very much concerned with the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture is only going to be allowed to spend £87,000 in the succeeding four months, as against £320,000 in the first eight months.  I hope the farmers who support the farmers' candidates will note the fact that their members have so little interest in this particular item.  Item No. 30 has an interest for me.  It is £159,000 for the Ireland Development Grant.  I would like some information upon that, because I know that the sum required for the eight months is the total sum for the year, and I was hopeful that we might have from the Ministry a proposal to set aside as a development grant a considerable sum of money to be immediately available whether prior to peace or immediately on the announcement of peace&mdash;if we are able to look forward to that happy day.  But whether peace comes or not, immediately, I was hopeful that we might have suggestions from the Ministry that a considerable sum of money should be allocated as a development grant to a body of Commissioners to act in a similar capacity to the Development Commissioners who have hitherto been acting.  It seems to me, if you have in existence a Development Commission, to whom you could allot a sum of money and who would be responsible for the useful expenditure of that money on development services, of a valuable character, you might do a great deal to meet much of the unemployment problem, in a constructive   fashion, and to meet difficulties that have been raised.  Suggestions have been put forward that the Government should grant this or the Government should grant that.  I think this a reasonable proposition that ought to have the attention of the Government, that they should set up a body in the nature of a Development Commission&mdash;or a Reconstruction Commission, if you like, to whom a sum might be granted for allotment for development and reconstruction purposes, to meet present needs and needs of the immediate future.  I believe that such will be required during the winter, and it would be better to deal with the problem of distress on lines of development rather than on lines of relief, and I was hopeful that there would be a sum included in the estimates which would provide for such works of development and reconstruction, and I am sorry to see that the mind of the Ministry has not gone in that direction and has not included a larger sum beyond this £159,000, which may be presumed to have been spent already.  The sum of £4,000,000, indicated for the Estimate raises a question which I have hinted at on one or two occasions&mdash;that the Dail should be given more information about the establishment of the army. We have no knowledge of how many men this provides for; we have no knowledge of the services or the organisation of the services, and I think it is essential that the Dail should be put in possession of the facts in regard to this organisation of Defence forces.  I am not cavilling at the amount.  It may be the very smallest on which the work could be done.  But I submit that the Dail ought to be placed in possession of very much more information than it has had in regard to the army which we are asked to pay £4,000,000 for for the eight months.  Criminal Investigation is another item that calls for attention, because I note that the sum estimated as required for the eight months is £10,000, and the sum for the whole year is to be £20,000, so that we are expecting to expend the same amount in the succeeding four months as we will have expended in the eight months ending the 6th of December.  That also, I think, should call for some explanation. 
     
    
      
       What item? 
     
    
      
       Criminal Investigation   Department (No. 50).  This is an addition, of course, to the Civic Guard. I noted with interest the remarks of the Minister in speaking of arrears of Income Tax, and while I feel strongly tempted to enlarge upon that, I prefer, as it has a personal application&mdash;not that the Minister intended it should have a personal application&mdash;but rather than give a cue to many other people, I prefer to make my own case as a private matter to the people concerned. 
     
    
      
       If there be no big difficulty in the way may I ask the President&mdash;the Minister for Finance&mdash;for another day for the discussion of this very important matter?  All of us who only got this Statement of Accounts as we came in this afternoon have not had time since to go through it, and consequently cannot enter into criticism of it in a proper manner.  If there is no technical difficulty I ask that the matter may be discussed on another day. 
     
    
      
       In that connection I would like to ask the President if he does not think that the right method of handling this question of finance would be to do what is done in every other Assembly in matters of this kind, because, after all, the main business of an Assembly like this is to be a check upon expenditure and to control the purse. Unless that be done all other power for legislation becomes nugatory in the end, and there can be no effective check until proposals for supply, or estimates in advance of Votes on Account, are not merely presented in bulk like this is submitted, although it may be under various heads, but submitted in some form for examination.  It is not presumed that there is anything faulty or culpable in that, but merely that the Dail should have some method of assuring itself that monies asked for are really required in order that in voting them, we are not merely voting monies, but that, in voting monies and in voting supply, we should have some effective control and check upon the policy embodied in them.  Deputy Johnson already referred to one matter, and that is Criminal Investigation.  It is an unhappy thing that Criminal Investigation should be required in this country. I hope the millennium will come, when it shall not be required, but it is an   alarming fact that it should be required quite to the extent that is stated.  It is not merely £19,000, but there is a further item, No. 57, which to me is a very mysterious item; it is called Secret Service, for which there is a sum of £220,000 I do not know what that Secret Service is, but I think it is very desirable this Estimate should come before the Dail and the course I have risen to propose to the Ministry in this matter is that the procedure usually adopted in Assemblies of this kind should be adopted here, and that procedure is that, a report having been made and the demand made that such and such monies are required, the account is referred to a Special Committee of Supply that will go through the various items, and if necessary ask for the production of the details of these various sums of which they are comprised and then report back to the Dail exactly what it feels in regard to each of these items under these 58 or 59 heads. That is the procedure usually adopted. I think it is quite unusual that an amount which represents a very large sum of money, some of which is already expended and beyond our reach or knowledge, but still a very large sum of money &mdash;something like thirty-eight millions, which is quite a considerable sum&mdash; should be asked for in this way. 
     
    
      
       It is a pity you were out when I made my statement. 
     
    
      
       Something like nineteen millions has been spent, and I suggest the Committee should be appointed for the purpose of examining these accounts and reporting back to the Dail. 
     
    
      
       I do not agree with the last Deputy who spoke that the best thing to do would be to appoint a Committee to go into these various items.  I do think it is rather a large order to ask the Dail, on such very short notice, to vote this large sum of money without having any details whatever before us as to the manner in which it is to be spent or has been spent.  If I am correctly informed, I understand it is the practice to pass votes separately for each of these Departments, and that on the vote for a particular Department it would be open to any member of the Dail to discuss generally the policy and the details of   administration of that particular Department concerned.  Now, there are a large number of these Departments for which money is asked in the vote, and we would like very much to discuss in this Dail the details of the administration, and the policy generally, of particular Departments.  It would be quite impossible to attempt anything like that on a proposal of this kind.  As I understand from the President, this is rather an urgent matter owing to the particular difficulty in which they find themselves due to the transition, and that this must be voted, I take it, before the 8th.  I would suggest that only one month's provision should be made instead of two; that would ensure that all those amounts would come up before us again within a month, and when they would come up again the Dail would have some opportunity of going into greater detail and discussing those votes one by one. I would suggest that the Government should take that course. 
     
    
      
       I take it this is simply a matter of voting on account for a certain sum of money in order to carry on.  I think the Dail will get an opportunity when the full vote is asked for, to discuss all these items.  It is the general practice that votes on account are generally passed when they are asked for, but that does not take away from the right of members to discuss the question of whether the sum of money asked for, should or should not be adopted. 
     
    
      
       We want an assurance to that effect. 
     
    
      
       I think the point has been missed somewhat.  In the ordinary way a Budget would be brought up somewhere about the beginning of the financial year, and that Budget would give you an estimate of the amount which would be expended and would give you an opportunity of imposing such taxation as would give you the money necessary to carry on the public services for the period.  Now, the Dail will recognise I think that would not have been possible this year, and the position of the Provisional Government, as I have explained it, was that it was a sort of administrative body simply carrying out supervision of the various services pending the passing of the Constitution, and the setting up of the Saorstat.  In that   capacity they were not in a position to levy taxation, and could not consequently have functioned in the way a Government would function in the ordinary circumstances. Now, the regulations that were made, and that we agreed to, were that the position would be, as I explained in my statement, that any Minister requiring money for his Department, and getting put up to him by the responsible head of that Department the sum required, would sign for that amount and the Minister for Finance countersigned it.  That was the arrangement which was to last for one month after the meeting of the Dail, and a month not having sufficed for bringing in the Saorstat, it is now necessary to extend this, and in order that it would not be necessary to come before the Dail again we put down either the date on which the Saorstat will be established or the 6th of December, the 6th December being certainly the latest date upon which that can be done.  The Vote that is asked for is a Vote on Account. That sum may not be spent&mdash;the full sum may not be required&mdash;but it is estimated that sum will cover the amount that will be required, and at a later stage the various items making up the total sum of £18,900,000 would be considered, and the discussion would take place on them.  At the beginning of the financial period I understand it is the recognised practice&mdash;I have not much experience, and I think very few of the Deputies here have&mdash;to take a block Vote on Account. That is our information.  This does not prejudice the discussion at a later stage, when you have those items before you in detail.  It will be recognised, I think, there was at least some little allowance to be made for constructing this new machinery, setting it up, and all the rest of it.  It may not, perhaps, have worked out according to plan, but some of us worked pretty late, or rather pretty early, and it was the best we could do in the circumstances.  It is put to the Dail in good faith, in the belief that we are doing the best that can be done in the circumstances, and consequently we put down this resolution to ease a situation that was scarcely foreseen when the regulations mentioned were made and agreed to.  The resolution that is on the paper here is necessary, for on Sunday next, and after Sunday next, we would   not be in a position to pay a single sixpence, because we would not have authority for it.  Of course, there are no salaries due on Sunday, but on Monday morning, if we wanted a ton of coal to heat this institution, we would not have it because we could not buy it for you. I can deal with some of the criticism, but I do not think it is advisable, having regard to the fact that they will come up again at a later stage. 
     
    
      
       Are we to understand none of these items may be exceeded, although some of them may be reduced? 
     
    
      
       That is right; they may not be exceeded.  Well, that was the bargain and the understanding that we had&mdash;that we would simply administer these Departments as we found them until the ordinary machinery of government was set up, and until a Parliament would sanction, or initiate, and make provision for whatever sums they intended to spend. 
     
    
      
       How will that meet the case of the Secret Service, the Army, the reconstruction of Cork, and the Civic Guard?  Those were not provided for by any other Administration, were they? 
     
    
      
       There was a Police Vote formerly; that would be replaced by the Civic Guard.  There was an understanding about the Cork situation that we would pay in the first instance, and get recouped for whatever liabilities the British Government had, as I understand. 
     
    
      
       What about the Tailteann Games? 
     
    
      
       I am afraid there was a little exception in that case; it was a very slight one. 
     
    
      
       May I take it the Vote is agreed to? The Dail agreed. 
     
    
      
       There is a motion on the Agenda from Deputy Figgis. 
     
    
      
       I think it is too late to take that to-night.  It is a matter of considerable importance, and I think it ought to receive very full justice. 
     
     
    
      
       I understand the Minister in charge of the Constitution is not going on with it this evening. 
     
    
      
       No, we are not. 
     
   
   
     COST OF LIVING COMMITTEE. 
    
      
       My motion is:&mdash; 
     
     &ldquo;Having regard to the fact that foodstuffs produced in Ireland may be bought more cheaply in England than in Ireland; and having regard to the fact that the general fall in price to the producer of such foodstuffs, and of other commodities necessary to livelihood, has not been accompained by a similar fall in price to the consumer; and having regard to the probability that these disproportions are the cause of much discontent, and are frustrating the development of industry on a reasonable basis of comfort to the worker and economic profit to the employer; to move, that a Committee be at once appointed, to be known as &lsquo;The Cost of Living Committee,&rsquo; and that the terms of reference be as follows:&mdash;To set forth a list of articles or commodities necessary to livelihood; to enquire into the prices available for such articles or commodities to the producer; to enquire into the prices being paid for such articles or commodities by the consumer; and to report if there be any undue disproportion between these two scales of prices, and, if so, to recommend the best measures to be taken to end that disproportion.&rdquo; I venture to say that there are probably very few matters in Ireland to-day of greater importance than this. The matter has been brought to my attention by a number of my constituents, people who represent, not one particular class of society, but who represent all classes of society; by those who are generally known as employers and those who are known as employees, each set of whom agree that this is possibly the very center of a great deal of discontent in Ireland to-day.  I have been studious to avoid here imposing or implying any blame upon any body or bodies.  I merely refer to the acknowledged facts and I suggest that a Committee should be appointed, or somebody should be appointed, or some organisation or organisations should be created to enquire into these things and to make a report to this Dail, as to the best method of   getting rid of them.  It would be very easy to distribute blame.  It would be, I think, possibly unjust to distribute blame.  I would not like it to be said any middleman inferred that I suggested, that he was profiteering at the expense of the community. It may well be true; it may be untrue; we have no means at present of discovering whether it is true or whether it is untrue, and what we do want to discover is what is the cause of it&mdash; whether the middleman is at fault, whether the railways are at fault, or who is at fault, and what exactly the cause is that you have here at present demands for a scale of wages declining back to what they had been in the pre-war period, because of competition elsewhere that is being maintained in some countries on that scale, whereas at the present moment it is impossible for human beings to live either at that scale or at double that scale.  It is a very familiar thing in all mechanics, and although it would be wrong to consider society as a mechanism, there is much that resembles mechanism about it, and it is a familiar principle in mechanics&mdash;that once a machine has got into the habit of a certain form or speed of action it is very difficult to bring it down to another speed or to bring it up to a higher speed.  These things happen slowly.  And it has happened that since 1914 circumstances have arisen in this world at large, particularly in Europe, where the whole scale of prices has steadily risen and at the same time, though not so fast, the scale of wages has risen. They rose out of proportion to one another; they are now falling out of proportion to one another, and the effect to-day is that employers are finding it quite impossible to conduct their businesses, because they are compelled to pay their employees a scale of wages that their employees insist is out of all proportion to the cost of living.  I was spoken to upon this matter about a week ago by a very considerable employer of labour in Dublin, a man of great influence, of understanding and sympathy.  He stated to me that he was compelled to thrust his workmen down to a scale of wages that he knew they could not live on, and he admitted it frankly in defence that they could not live on it, but said &ldquo;I am not considering their livelihood; I am bound to consider my business.  I   am sorry for them.&rdquo;  He says &ldquo;something has happened, some part of the machinery has ceased to work in harmony with some other part, with the consequence that I am compelled, if my business must be a paying business and not a philanthropic concern, to insist on a scale of wages that I know is not just.&rdquo;  And, putting it from the employer's point of view, he stated that if the prices that were available in 1914 were available to-day, with the same wages, workmen would be better off than they are to-day at the scale of wages that is available as against the prices that are available.  I have taken advantage, in view of this debate that was arising here, to have compiled for me some figures that I will read to the Dail that may be useful to the Dail These are figures actually compiled within the past 48 hours.  They have been taken in the Dublin markets as representing the wholesale rates&mdash;they have been taken as representative of a very large number of shops&mdash;not high-class shops, not shops in areas in which people live who could afford to pay better prices, but taken from shops in the poorer districts, and I will compare one set against the other, in order that this Dail may follow exactly what is the huge difference to which I have referred.  There is an item of commodity known as &ldquo;cowheel,&rdquo; the price in the Metropolitan Market was 41⁄2d. a lb; the price in the shops was 1s. to 1s. 6d.  The market price for heifer and bullock beef was 7d./9d., the price in the shops was 1s. 4d. to 1s. 8d., and in that connection I may remark in passing that the 1914 price was 41⁄2d./8d.; the price of mutton in the market was from 9d./10d., the price in the shops is 1s. 4d. to 1s. 10d.  Under the head of pigs and pork, the top price was 10d. for pork, the shop price is 1s. 6d.  The price for bacon is 2s. to 2s. 6d. per lb; the price in pre-war for the same bacon was 7d./8d., for the quality now available at 2s., and 10d. for the quality now available at 2s. 6d.  So I could go down the list.  Let me take another class of goods &mdash;vegetables per st., 4d. and 6d. in the markets, 1s. in the shops.  Take the item milk: 1s. a gallon, rail paid, in Dublin 2s. 4d.; available in the shops at a pre-war price of 3d. against 7d.  I suppose the discrepancy is much greater in respect of the price for vegetable and fruit   than as regards other commodities.  Yet in the market yesterday there were more vegetables and fruit than could be disposed of.  These are serious facts, which I believe, most seriously affect the population of this country at large than possibly any other single fact to-day.  They affect the whole question of employment because they affect the whole question of the profitable conduct of industry. The first item I set down here raised the question by one or two Deputies.  I am prepared if any Deputy wishes to have particulars given to give the particulars of eggs and butter.  Citizens in Dublin send to Liverpool for Irish butter, because they can buy it cheaper in Liverpool than they can in Dublin, and they regularly and consistently send to Liverpool for it.  The question is not quite so simple as it may appear.  It is not that there is profiteering in the shop that causes Irish butter to be had cheaper from Liverpool by inhabitants in Dublin than they can buy it in Dublin itself.  The fault is not altogether with the shopkeepers. I know that there you touch on the very vexed question of freights and through freights, and a whole variety of other questions are raised in this.  I therefore move this in order that the Committee should be appointed.  Since I sent you in this I am not sure whether one Committee is the best way of getting this work done.  I believe it may be necessary to create a number of Committees for each centre under the ægis and general control of one Committee of whichever Department of the Ministry it affects.  The procedure I would suggest in regard to that is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce receives from day to day figures that come in from the country with regard to certain commodities, and an average figure is calculated on these.  The average figure appears in the recent report of the Departmental Committee.  As the reports come in from different parts of the country they can test these figures with the figure they declare to be a fair average. They should be in a position to state which part of the country is charged above the average.  Dublin and Cork will be found to be charged too high.  In Nenagh at the moment butter is almost invaluable, and milk is difficult to get for children.  When any such place is discovered reference should be made to the Departmental Committee working in   connection with the Department and the Local Committee, who would suggest ways and means and report back to the Central Committee, not for confirmation, and let the matter then come to the Local Committee, which would act with the Minister in question, who would be able to put before this Dail the general facts, which the Dail would be able to examine, and end this anomaly and remove this cog which is interfering with the smooth working of this machinery. 
    
      
       I second the motion, and in doing so I think that, with the exception of the Treaty, this question raised by Deputy Darrell Figgis is, perhaps, of the most paramount importance. I think this touches the kernel and heart of the nation, and I venture to say that if the essentials of life, such as milk, potatoes, bread, flour and some other commodities were in abundance, and at a reasonable price, it would go a long way towards producing stability in Ireland or in any other country.  Until the cost of the essentials of life comes down, you will be constantly in a vicious circle, and presumably if the cost of the essentials of life comes down, unduly high wages must tend to come down also. There is such a thing as unduly high wages. 
     
    
      
       They do not exist. 
     
    
      
       I would heartily support this proposition, and would like to bring to the notice of the Dail the fact that you have established in many centres anti-profiteering committees.  In Waterford City and Clonmel I know these committees have been extremely useful.  We started one in Waterford City in July, 1921, and it has met with great success since.  We have been instrumental in bringing down the price of milk meat, bread and flour, which are, in fact, the primary essentials of life.  I heartily endorse Deputy Darrell Figgis' proposition that the best way of tackling this question of unduly high prices would be to set up committees.  I am sure that when you get the price of the essentials of life down we will no longer hear of threatened strikes, and it will go a long way towards producing stability in Ireland. 
     
    
      
       The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked me to mention that his Department has been   considering this matter for some time.  I do not know whether the Minister himself or one of his officials met Deputy Figgis in the cattle market yesterday, but I was informed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce intended to send up a representative there.  I was at some loss when Deputy Darrell Figgis was mentioning prices of meat sold in the Dublin Cattle Market, and comparing them with the prices sold in the shop. That is scarcely a fair criterion.  My information is that a beast weighing 12 cwt. and sold at a certain price per cwt. materialises, when sold retail at 7 cwt. only.  Some other person knows more about that than I do but that is my information. It is not fair to mention that meat is sold at 7d. and 9d., and then retailed at 1s. 4d. and 1s. 6d. in the shops; one is not a fair figure to set against the other.  It reminds me of some of the criticisms of my very able friend, the Postmaster-General. 
       The Government is in sympathy with the main object of the motion, viz., to ascertain to what extent the high prices charged for certain essential commodities are unreasonable. 
       Mr. Figgis' proposals, however, are not the best for that purpose. 
       Part of them propose to do what has already been done&mdash;viz., &ldquo;Setting forth a list of articles or commodities necessary to livelihood&rdquo;; &ldquo;Enquiring into the prices being paid for such articles or commodities by the Consumer&rdquo;; both these things are done in the official report in the Cost of Living already produced, and will be done in the intended periodical reports.  There is no necessity to do them again.  The objection to the rest of the proposals is not so much to what they are intended to do, but to the procedure.  One committee for the 26 Counties which proposes to enquire into the &ldquo;Prices available to the Producer,&rdquo; for the long list of commodities in the Cost of Living Report would take months, if not years to cover the ground. 
     
    
      
       This all was written before I had explained my scheme. 
     
    
      
       Such prices very even for the same article from district   to district, and the one Committee, in order to arrive at complete results, would have to engage in an enormous number of local investigations.  The Minister for Commerce mentioned that in some streets a higher price is charged for goods than in other streets, and that the price varies several pence in the pound, and that is a matter which is engaging his attention.  Next week we can expect to have an itinerary, at any rate, of Deputy Figgis around the shops to see what they are doing when he has completed his investigations in the Cattle Market.  The essential thing in any attempt to deal with high prices is promptness, and it would be much better to appoint Local Committees to investigate the circumstances of their own particular locality. There is a good deal more in this, but the Government would therefore propose to set up Local Commissions on prices, and to set them up, at any rate in the first instance, in places where actual prices are substantially in excess of the average prices of Ireland as a whole, or where the increase in prices as compared with 1914 are substantially in excess of the average increase in Ireland as a whole, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes to give notice of a motion to this effect. 
     
    
      
       I would like to point out that the President's statement is not correct. 
     
    
      
       The Dail must adjourn at 8.30 unless it has been otherwise decided. 
     
    
      
       Read Order 75. 
     
    
      
       It is not my fault any way.  He talked it out himself. 
     
    
      
       The position is that this discussion will be resumed at the next sitting of the Dail. 
     
    
      
       The next meeting at which private members' business comes on. 
       Motion: &ldquo;That the Dail do now adjourn,&rdquo; put and carried. 
       The Dail adjourned at 8.30 till Tuesday, October 10th.
