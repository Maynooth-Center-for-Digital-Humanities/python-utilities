     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - OWENMORE DRAINAGE SCHEME. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether it is intended to include the tributary of the Owenmore which runs near Bunninadden Creamery, County Sligo, in the Owenmore Drainage Scheme; and, if so, when it is hoped to commence work on this river. 
     
     
      
       The tributary of the Owenmore River, which runs near Bunninadden Creamery, is outside the limits of the Owenmore Drainage Scheme, consequently no work will be carried out on the stream in question under that scheme. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ARRESTS UNDER PUBLIC SAFETY ACT. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice whether he can state how many persons have been arrested under the terms of the Public Safety Act; how many such persons are at present being detained without trial, their names, and the dates of their arrest; how many have been convicted; and what sentence has been imposed in each case. 
     
     
      
       Four persons were arrested under the provisions of the Public Safety Act, 1927.  There are no persons at present being detained under that Act.  No person was convicted under that Act of any offence. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - EVIL LITERATURE LEGISLATION. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice if he can now state definitely the date of introduction of proposals for legislation dealing with the Report of the Committee on Evil Literature. 
     
     
      
       The Executive Council have accorded   priority to the Bill which is to be introduced in pursuance of the recommendations of the Committee on Evil Literature.  The Bill is in an advanced stage of preparation, and whilst I cannot name a date for its introduction I think it will be feasible to introduce it during the course of the coming month. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister not consider it imperative, in view of the Dalkey and Killiney holds-up of trains and other burnings of newspapers, that a special effort should be made to introduce the Bill at an early date? 
     
     
      
       I think I have already explained to the House that this is a difficult and intricate measure and must of necessity take time and that there has been no delay in the preparation of the Bill. As far as these raids to which the Deputy has alluded are concerned, they are raids which we cannot and will not tolerate.  They are foolish and criminal. 
     
     
      
       That does not arise out of the question. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps I may take this opportunity of giving notice to the persons who took part in those raids that we will take strong measures to counter them, whether they are armed or unarmed. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister not think it desirable that before the imported Sunday papers are distributed that he should appoint somebody to take a glance through them and if necessary prevent their distribution? 
     
     
      
       I am afraid I would have no statutory authority to carry out that suggestion even if it were feasible. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - AREA OF CHARGE FOR BURIAL GROUNDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has received representations from local authorities with reference to the determination of the area of charge for the provision of   burial grounds; and whether he proposes to introduce proposals for legislation to enable Boards of Health to fix the areas of charge as they may determine.

     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - PAINSTOWN (KILDARE) WATER SUPPLY. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that there are three families, numbering 22 persons, living in labourers' cottages in the townland of Painstown, Kill, County Kildare, whose only water supply, of doubtful quality, is obtained from a road ditch; that they have to use a cup to fill a bucket when they require water; that there is no pure water to be had within a distance of two miles; that in time of drought they have to use filthy water from the canal over half a mile distant; that five children suffering from scarlatina have been sent to hospital from the district; and whether he will have inquiries made with a view to the provision of a supply of pure water for these people. 
     
     
      
       This matter has not come under my notice but I am having inquiries made in regard to it. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - MARKET FOR IRISH HERRINGS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether his attention has been drawn to a paragraph in the &ldquo;Waterford News&rdquo; of May 11th, 1928, to the effect that the small prices and poor demand now prevailing for Irish herrings are caused by reason of the fact that the British Government will not allow the Irish Free State to trade with Soviet Russia, which country has been the natural outlet for marketing Irish herrings during the past few years; whether a deputation of Waterford buyers recently waited on the Government, and were informed that their demands could not be acceded to; and, if so, whether the   Minister will make a statement on the matter. 
     
     
      
       I have seen the newspaper paragraph referred to.  The statements made in that paragraph regarding the causes of the depressed state of the herring fishing industry on the south coast are entirely without foundation.  There is no restriction whatever placed upon our curers in dealing with Russia either by this Government or by any other Government. No deputation of curers has waited on the Government in reference to this matter. 
       The Deputy is of course aware that neither the Government of Great Britain nor of any other country possesses or claims any right to prevent the Saorstat from trading with Russia or to interfere in any way in the external trade relations of the Saorstat. 
       As I stated in this House on 9th May, during the debate on the Estimates for my Department, Russia, for domestic reasons, is not buying the usual quantity of British or Irish herrings.  The difficulty appears to be largely a matter of arranging credits. Russia was in pre-war days a good market for the lower quality of herrings.  The Irish herrings are in the main of a high class which sell readily in Germany and the United States of America at prices which are considerably above the prices realised by the North Sea herring and frequently much above the prices fetched by west coast Scottish cure. 
       The quality of the herrings which have during the past month been caught on our coast has been poor, and curers have not handled them to any great extent.  The quality is now improving. 
     
     
      
       Might I ask the Minister, in view of the fact that the herrings exported to Germany from Ireland are premature and not up to the standard quality, would he and his Department endeavour to secure a market for those herrings in Russia? 
     
     
      
       I have heard no complaint of the type mentioned. 
     
     
     
      
       Are any endeavours being made by the Minister's Department to get back the market in Russia? 
     
     
      
       I do not say that we have. 
     
     
      
       Might I suggest that it would be advisable to do so? 
     
     
      
       I think it would be primarily a matter for the persons engaged in the trade itself if they saw any opening for persons to buy. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister's Department not set an example by trying to secure a market for Irish herrings? 
     
     
      
       It will be purely a matter for the Trade Department. 
     
     
      
       I submit that it should be one of the primary responsibilities in relation to the Minister's Department to endeavour to secure a market for Irish herrings. 
     
     
      
       I do not think so. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ACQUISITION OF NAVAN ESTATES. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether the Land Commission has acquired the estates known as the Medge Estate, Alexanderside, and the Johnstown Estate, Alexanderside, Navan; and, if so, when it is proposed to distribute these lands. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission are about to make an offer to purchase the untenanted lands of Alexander Reid, containing 66a. 1r. 13p., on the Robt, Hy. Metge Estate, Co. Meath. 
       The lands of Johnstown comprise two holdings, total area 133a. 2r. 10p. in the possession of two tenants on the estate of Christopher Johns and others, in which particulars have been lodged by the owners to enable the lands to be vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day under the Land Act, 1923.  This estate has not yet been reached in its order to be dealt with by the Land Commission. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - KILBREW ESTATE (MEATH). 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state the number of tenants on the Kilbrew Estate, Ashbourne, County Meath; whether all those tenants pay annuities for their lands; the amount of annuities paid by Christopher Wall, and the number of acres he has in his possession. 
     
     
      
       There are 25 separate allotments on this estate.  Up to the present proceedings have had to be instituted in a few cases for the recovery of arrears. 
       The area allotted to Christopher Wall is 46a. 2r. 39p., subject to an annual payment of £56.  His instalments have been paid up to 1st November last. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ACQUISITION OF LEIGHLINBRIDGE FARM. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether the Land Commission propose to acquire the farm of Mrs. E.A. Smith, Friary, Leighlinbridge (Poe estate), for distribution among the uneconomic holders in the vicinity. 
     
     
      
       No holding of Mrs. E. A. Smith on the Poe estate can be identified.  The holdings of Mrs. Smith situate in the townlands of Ballyboley on the estate of W. E. Jacob and another, in the townlands of Ballyboley or Leighlinbridge on the estate of W. S. Duckett-Stewart, and in Leighlinbridge on the estate of Emmaline M. Elliott and others, comprising in all 137 acres, have been vested in her as tenant purchaser under the Land Purchase Acts, and the Land Commission do not propose to take any action with regard to their acquisition. 
     
     
      
       Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the lady who owns this farm does not even reside upon it, that it is a large farm amounting to several hundred acres in extent, and that as far as I can make out, it is not being worked in any way whatever? Is he aware that when she wants even a few potatoes she has to go to a neighbour, and is he satisfied that that state of affairs should continue while   there are people in urgent need of land in the neighbourhood? 
     
     
      
       The farm is only 137 acres in extent.  The lady resides on the holding, according to my information, for a certain period each year. There is no real congestion in that area, and if there was any real congestion we certainly would have resumed the holding before it was vested in the owner. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - REVALUATION OF KILKENNY HOLDING. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will make provision for the revaluation of the holding held by Michael Ryan, Kilmadum, Ballyfoyle, Kilkenny (Hunt estate); and whether he will state what arrangements, if any, are made by the Land Commission for a revaluation in such cases. 
     
     
      
       On Schedule of Particulars lodged on behalf of the owner of the estate of Rev. Michael Hunt, Michael Ryan, of Kilmadum, Ballyfoyle, is returned as tenant of holding in townland of Ballyfoyle described as containing 25a. 1r. 27p. held under a judicial rent of £14 4s. fixed by agreement No. 861 dated 9th February, 1910.  The Standard Purchase Annuity will be automatically fixed in accordance with Part I of the First Schedule of the Land Act, 1923, at 65 per cent. of the rent.  Meanwhile, pending the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; for the estate the tenant is liable for payment in lieu of rent under Section 20 of the Act representing 75 per cent. of the rent. 
     
     
      
       Could the Parliamentary Secretary state when the appointed day is likely to be? 
     
     
      
       I cannot say. 
     
     
      
       Could the Parliamentary Secretary state what arrangements can be made where a tenant claims that the rent which was fixed, even though it was fixed by agreement, is unduly high as compared with that fixed on other allottees?  Is there any remedy which would enable a tenant to have a revaluation made? 
     
     
     
      
       The question of valuation is not for the Land Commission. It is a matter for the Ministry of Finance. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - APPOINTED DAY FOR DONEGAL ESTATE. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he can state when the appointed day will be declared in accordance with the provisions of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, on the estate of Mrs. Cornelia Adair, deceased (Col. I. R. Baillie, agent), situate in the parish of Gartan, Rural District of Letterkenny, County Donegal, on which there are 79 tenants. 
     
     
      
       The Land Commission are not at present in a position to state when the appointed day will be fixed in respect of the Adair Estate.  In consequence of amendments of boundaries and areas, and the exclusion of a road, the provisional list already published does not correctly describe the holdings as now marked on the ground.  It is anticipated that a substituted provisional list embodying these amendments will be published at an early date. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ACQUISITION OF KEOGH ESTATE (SLIGO). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether the Land Commission intend to acquire the demesne lands on the Keogh Estate, at Geevagh, County Sligo, for sub-division among the tenants on that estate; and, if so, when these lands will be available for sub-division. 
     
     
      
       Proceedings have been instituted under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, for the acquisition of the lands of Ballynashee, Straduff, Tap, Carrowcashel, and Tullynure in this matter containing 795a. 0r. 38p. or thereabouts.  These lands were published in a provisional list of lands which, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, will become vested in the Land Commission on the Appointed Day.  The Land Commission are not yet in a position to state when these lands will be divided. 
     
   
   
     PRIVATE BUSINESS. - LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROVISIONAL ORDER CONFIRMATION BILL, 1928&mdash;COMMITTEE. 
     
      
       I move that the Bill be considered in Committee. 
       Agreed. 
       The Bill was put through Committee without amendment and ordered to be reported to the House. 
       Ordered: That the Report Stage be taken on Wednesday, 30th May. 
     
   
   
     PUBLIC BUSINESS. - LOCAL GOVERNMENT (RATES ON SMALL DWELLINGS) BILL, 1928&mdash;FROM THE SEANAD. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister indicate when it is proposed to take this Bill? 
     
     
      
       I propose to take it on Wednesday next and to ask the Dail to accept all the amendments of the Seanad. 
       Ordered: That the Bill be considered on Wednesday, 30th May. 
     
   
   
     PUBLIC BUSINESS. - BODIES CORPORATE (EXECUTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS) BILL, 1928 (SEANAD).&mdash;SECOND STAGE. 
     
      
       This is a Private Members' Bill from the Seanad, and upon motion being made that the Bill be read a Second Time, it will be put on the Order Paper. 
     
     
      
       I move that the Bill be set down for this day week for the Second Stage. 
     
     
      
       I was going to ask if this Bill will come on in Private Members' time. 
     
     
      
       If I understand the Minister aright, he is giving notice that he will move the Second Stage of the Bill next Thursday. That means that it will come on in Government time.  If it were moved by a Private Member, it would come on in Private Members' time. 
     
   
   
     ORDERS OF THE DAY. - SLAUGHTERED ANIMALS (COMPENSATION) BILL, 1928&mdash;SECOND STAGE. 
     
      
       The necessity for this Bill arises out of the passage of an Act in the British Parliament called the Importation of Animals Act, 1922.  Under that Act cattle exported   to England from Ireland, and slaughtered at quarantine stations at the ports in England, because of foot and mouth disease, were slaughtered without compensation.  This Bill is to make provision for that state of affairs. It should be clear that Irish cattle, or any other cattle slaughtered in England because of foot and mouth disease, except slaughtered at a port, are paid for by the British Ministry out of British taxation.  Any cattle slaughtered in Ireland because of foot and mouth disease are paid for by the Irish Government.  Since 1922 and until this Bill there was no provision anywhere for paying compensation for cattle slaughtered in England in quarantine stations at a port.  This Bill is to make provision for that purpose. The idea of the Bill is to create a fund and vest it in trustees.  The particular fund contemplated by the Bill will be established in accordance with certain regulations laid down in the statute. It will be fed from per capita charges made in respect of cattle, sheep and pigs exported.  The calculation shows that at the rates suggested in the Bill, 21⁄2d. for cattle, 1d. for pigs and 1⁄2d. for sheep that method of raising money will bring in about £7,000 yearly, so that after two years there will be a fund there of about £14,000.  This particular method has been agreed on after consultation with the National Executive of the cattle trade.  The Executive consists of representatives from the various organisations which control the cattle trade at the present time.  There are exporters' and other organisations of that sort&mdash;two in Dublin, one in Cork, and I think there is another.  The live stock trade has a national executive which, I think, is representative of every organisation dealing&mdash;directly or indirectly&mdash;with the cattle trade.  This Bill has been prepared in consultation with them, and in its general outlines has their agreement, so that to that extent it is an agreed Bill.  The Bill provides that after a certain time arrangements can be made under which these particular charges shall be no longer levied.  The machinery for levying the charges is set out in the Bill.  It is quite simple. Trustees will be appointed by the National   Executive of the live stock trade, and these trustees will have for sale certain stamps, which will be purchased by the shippers and put on the forms which they hand to the shipping companies when shipping live stock.  There will be very little book-keeping.  The fund will accumulate in that way. After a while it is expected, in fact it is almost absolutely certain, that £15,000 or £20,000 will have accumulated, and that will be quite sufficient money, in my view, and in the view of the trade, to meet this particular contingency. 
     
     There were, I think, in 1922 two or three cases where cattle were slaughtered at a quarantine station at a port because of foot-and-mouth disease.  These cattle were owned by people in Donegal and, I think, by some people in County Dublin.  At any rate, they were owned by people in the Saorstat.  No compensation was paid to them.  This Bill will be retrospective as far as these cattle are concerned.  These were the only cases that have arisen since 1922. Such cases could not arise before 1922, as before that any cattle slaughtered anywhere in England, because of the foot-and-mouth disease, were paid for by the British Ministry of Lands and Agriculture.  Since 1922 there were these two or three cases, and the value of the animals would be about five or six thousand pounds.  The owners are without compensation since, and it is felt that, as we are making this provision, we should in all equity include the cases of people who were unfortunate enough to have cattle slaughtered three or four years ago.  This Bill provides for that.  Personally, I think it is most unlikely that this particular contingency will arise again.  Under the present arrangements at the other side, I think it is most unlikely that cattle will be slaughtered in quarantine stations.  The most elaborate precautions are taken to see that cattle leaving this country are free from disease.  The quarantine stations on the other side are water-tight, if I might use the expression, and it is not likely in the future that disease could possibly get into a quarantine station.  In view of that state of affairs, I think it is most unlikely   that there will be in future any slaughter of cattle in quarantine stations.  At the same time, in view of the fact that there is foot-and-mouth disease in England, and that outbreaks of the disease occur at times very near the ports, there is considerable insecurity amongst the cattle trade by reason of the fact that some shipment of 400 or 500 cattle, representing property to the value of eight or ten thousand pounds, might have the misfortune while in a quarantine station to develop foot-and-mouth disease and be slaughtered, with no liability on anybody for compensation.  I think the cattle trade agree with that point of view.  At the same time it is easy to understand the insecurity that the existing state of affairs causes in the minds of cattle shippers.  They want to provide against the possibility in the future that cattle will be slaughtered in a quarantine station in England, and the live-stock executive have agreed that this is a suitable way of doing it.  As I said, the fund will fill up at the rate of about £7,000 a year, and consequently at the end of two years there will be a fund of £14,000 or thereabouts.  I should think if they have any luck that that fund will lie there for a considerable time without any very big call on it, and the accumulated interest on that money, I should say, would provide funds for all time for this particular purpose. 
     I want to make the position clear again.  If cattle are slaughtered in the Saorstat because of foot and mouth disease there is provision for paying for them.  If cattle are slaughtered anywhere in England, except in a quarantine station, there is provision to pay for them; they are paid for by the British Government.  This Bill deals with a case where cattle are slaughtered in England in a quarantine station at a port.  As far as we are concerned, we want to hand over this fund to the trade itself, with as little control as possible.  We believe that it can be administered more effectively, more efficiently, more cheaply, and more satisfactorily in that way, and this Bill provides in a regular way for the appointment of trustees, sets out and limits their powers, appoints assessors,   and so on, to value the cattle in the event of cattle being slaughtered, and my point of view is that the less the Government has to do with the matter the better. 
     
      
       No doubt this Bill will be very welcome, but it has, perhaps, come a little late.  There are just a few points that the Minister did not make any mention of, and which, I believe, would require attention if the Bill is to be made completely satisfactory. The Minister made no mention of compensation in the case of extra long periods of detention.  Cattle deteriorate a great deal under those conditions, and, as I understand the terms of the assessment, the valuation of the cattle, pigs or sheep will be at or previous to the time of slaughter.  I think it will be necessary in cases where they are detained under suspicion and where the disease is not found amongst them, to give some form of compensation to the owners of these animals.  Another case is with regard to veterinary examination at the ports of embarkation. I hope that that will be perhaps a little bit more intensive than it has been. No doubt, numerous cases of tubercular animals have got through.  The veterinary inspectors evidently failed to notice them, and in the case of the fat cattle trade it is very detrimental in the markets in England to find these animals getting through.  Evidently under this Bill the veterinary inspectors will have to hand over a clean Bill of health to the shipowners. 
     
     
      
       I think the Deputy is under a slight misapprehension.  This Bill only deals with foot and mouth disease, and the slaughtering of cattle suffering from foot and mouth disease. There has always been an inspection at the ports. 
     
     
      
       Quite so.  As I understand it, animals will require to have a clean bill of health&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       &mdash;which, I take it, will be in all circumstances, whether from foot and mouth or any other disease, and I hope that the examination will be a little more strict than it has   been.  The Minister did not say what the position in Northern Ireland will be.  Will the Government in Northern Ireland take steps to introduce a Bill on the same lines as this?  He said that this would be retrospective with regard to cattle.  As far as I can recollect, about the year 1922 shippers of pigs had some losses.  If that is the case, I believe that the Bill should apply to pigs as well as to cattle. 
     
     
      
       I do not think that is so. 
     
     
      
       I have certain information.  Losses occurred through the detention of pigs for a very lengthy period.  When the Bill comes up later perhaps amendments will be put in to include such losses as occurred owing to extra periods of detention.  This largely affects the question of store cattle.  Beef cattle can always be slaughtered at the port, and for beef cattle, if any compensation has to be paid, it will naturally be less than what will have to be paid for store cattle. The Bill might require a few amendments to make it a little more acceptable than it is. 
     
     
      
       I welcome this Bill. I have been directly interested in the cattle export trade, and I speak on behalf of the trade.  For the past three or four years we had been endeavouring to get some security with regard to cattle exported from this country. Time out of mind we came to the Minister.  I think in 1922 a good deal of cattle were held up at the ports and slaughtered during the ten hours' detention, and some were held in quarantine for nearly a fortnight.  After a good deal of consultation with the trade the Minister has introduced this Bill.  We are satisfied.  We have consulted everybody connected with the trade, and I believe that if the Bill passes through in its present form it will cover our case, and it will be a very welcome Bill. 
     
     
      
       As one of those who advocated the taking of measures with a view to making provision for the existing circumstances in regard to the slaughter of cattle in quarantine stations, I wish to express appreciation   of the fact that the Minister has at last been able to come to an agreement with the trade, as a result of which this measure has been introduced.  We recognised, from the efforts that were being made to introduce a Bill by means of which the Government would take responsibility for compensation, that it was very difficult to deal with this matter.  It did not seem desirable that the Government should accept responsibility for compensation for losses of live stock which were slaughtered when outside its control, and the cattle which are slaughtered in British quarantine stations are slaughtered out of the control of the Irish Government.  Therefore a difficulty arises with regard to a method of securing compensation.  I am glad to see by this Bill that the Minister has, by an arrangement with the cattle trade, arrived at a compromise, and I believe that this will work out to the satisfaction of everybody concerned. It is a fact that every form of insecurity which may exist in regard to the ultimate sale of cattle which are shipped from this country has a reaction on the prices which are paid to the farmers.  Dealers in cattle must ensure in the prices which they pay that they have a margin of safety, with the result that any element of uncertainty which exists in the disposal of our cattle between the time of buying from the farmers and the time of selling to the English butcher reacts to the disadvantage of the farmers. Therefore, I feel that the introduction and passing of this Bill will have a certain effect in improving the condition and the sale of Irish cattle and for that reason it is welcome. 
     
     I am glad also that the Minister has seen fit to introduce the retrospective clause.  The agitation which existed at one time, and which we gave voice to in the Dail, resulted from the slaughter of a considerable number of cattle in quarantine stations in 1924, I think. As a result of that slaughter several cattle dealers lost very severely.  In certain cases some of the smaller cattle shippers were almost placed in a bankrupt position.  We felt that they suffered a grave injustice and we are glad   that this opportunity has arisen whereby that injustice may be remedied.  On behalf of those who in the past advocated a measure of this kind, I welcome the Bill. 
     
      
       As Deputy O'Reilly pointed out, I understand that no provision is made in connection with cattle shipped from ports situated in the Six Counties.  As far as some of the northern ports are concerned, as the Minister for Agriculture knows, there are numbers of cattle sent through them from the Saorstat and they are shipped from those ports to England and Scotland.  In the event of these cattle contracting foot and mouth disease or being slaughtered in quarantine there is no provision made in this Bill to compensate the owners of cattle who live in the Saorstat.  The Minister referred to the fact that when cattle are being shipped from a port certain stamps will be put on the consignment note to the shipping companies.  In the case of cattle shipped from the Saorstat through a port in the Six Counties it might be possible to make a similar arrangement at the station where the cattle are first booked.  Possibly the Minister will take that matter into consideration at a later stage so that the shippers situated in the Saorstat and in the border counties may not be deprived of the benefits of this Bill.  I would like the Minister to give consideration to that matter. 
     
     
      
       I am not as enthusiastic as some Deputies in regard to this matter.  I regard it as a second best.  I regret that it ever had to be introduced, but I see the necessity for it.  If Deputies will think over it, they will see the reasons.  This is a Bill for the purpose of providing compensation for cattle slaughtered because of foot and mouth disease.  If you take the Bill and consider its object, it seems to be a perfectly legitimate Bill and a perfectly legitimate object.  You will see it is a very regrettable necessity.  The minute this Bill is introduced, however, it opens another prospect and Deputy O'Reilly underlined that prospect at once by saying that this Bill deals with cattle slaughtered because of foot and mouth disease, but there is no provision to deal with cattle that deteriorate   because they were kept for commercial or disease reasons at a port in England.  Other Deputies say it is a pity that this Bill does not cover the case of animals slaughtered because of tuberculosis.  Even in Ireland we will have to be careful that this Bill does not lead us very much further than we intend to be led.  It is a bad thing to interfere with trade in that way.  Here you have suggestions made that this Bill should cover compensation for animals that deteriorate in England because of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease or for any of the other reasons that the importing country, England, thinks fit to keep them at the port.  Cattle may be kept at the port for a certain length of time, they deteriorate, and the owner wants compensation. Look at the prospect that that opens up at once&mdash;all sorts of claims.  Look at the way that could be abused by exporters on this side and abused on the other side by English officials.  Any business man, and anyone in the trade, can see at once a hundred and one ways in which that could be abused.  Yet it is quite a reasonable thing to suggest, and it shows you the danger of introducing a Bill like that. 
     
     I hope Deputies will confine this Bill to one purpose only, and that is the paying of compensation for cattle slaughtered because of foot and mouth disease.  Deputies here and interested people in this country think they are going to improve this Bill in their own interests.  We will be asked to pay compensation for cows slaughtered because an English official diagnoses indurated udder due to tuberculosis.  The people who ship such animals would consider that a very beneficent provision. It is suggested that there should be such arrangements made in this Bill.  Remember there is an interest on the other side also.  There are the buyers on the other side and the officials of another Ministry to be considered.  They will all take into account that certain contingencies are being covered by a levy on the trade here.  It will colour any risks that may be taken here and it will colour the point of view on the other side in the way in which they administer Acts and, on the whole, you will be doing an   extremely dangerous thing if you extend this Bill.  The mere fact that certain things are suggested is a justification of the attitude that I have always taken.  If at all possible this is a problem that should be dealt with voluntarily by the trade themselves.  I realised the difficulties of the trade dealing with the matter voluntarily and in the end I decided to take the step of introducing this measure. 
     
      
       I did not for a moment think that the Bill should cover tubercular disease. 
     
     
      
       I did not say you did, but you suggested that it should be extended to cover depreciation brought about by cattle being detained for an extended period. 
     
     
      
       Through foot and mouth disease. 
     
     
      
       That is one thing. There are other interests that think it should cover losses sustained through other reasons, and the whole thing would go along that way.  There are interests on the other side also quite ready to use this Bill for their own purposes.  My advice is that the Bill should be confined strictly to the one point.  Northern Ireland is in the same position as we are in in regard to cattle leaving Northern ports and being slaughtered in the quarantine stations in England.  No compensation is paid. We have not provided here for cattle leaving through Belfast or Derry.  The Deputy is right; a lot of Northern cattle leave through Belfast and Derry, including a lot of Donegal cattle, but the problem is not confined to Donegal cattle.  Cattle leave Cork and leave places all over the country and pass through Belfast.  They come through Belfast, not for any reasons connected with their location on this side, but because of their destination on the other side.  The fact is that the cattle going to Glasgow go through Belfast.  I have no definite information as to what is intended in Northern Ireland, but I have reason to believe that this question is being considered there, and our business at the moment is to provide compensation for cattle leaving our ports and to wait and see. 
     
     
     
      
       I am not quite clear as to the exact form of the amendments suggested, but it appears to me that the principle of this Bill is contained in Section 8; that would be the establishment, maintenance and management of a fund to be called the Slaughtered Animals Compensation Fund.  With regard to the amendments in Committee, it seems to me it would be very difficult to move amendments covering the case of cattle that deteriorate during periods of detention. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
       Committee Stage ordered for Friday, 1st June. 
     
   
   
     ORDERS OF THE DAY. - TELEGRAPH BILL, 1928.&mdash;SECOND STAGE. 
     
      
       I move the Second Reading of the Telegraph Bill, 1928. The purpose of this Bill is to enable the changes in the rates of charges for telegrams, which I outlined in my Budget Statement, to be given effect to.  I stated then that there is at present a loss of over £150,000 a year on the telegraph service.  As a matter of fact, a great part of the losses in the Post Office can be ascribed to two branches of the Post Office service&mdash;telegrams and registered correspondence.  Each of these entails a loss of something like £150,000 a year.  There is considerable difficulty, owing to international arrangements and to the fact that a great mass of registered correspondence arises outside the country, in effecting any changes there.  So it is that, so far as telegraphs are concerned, the position is different, and we feel that this is a satisfactory way of getting the sum of money which is required for the purpose of balancing the Budget. 
     
     It seems to me that it is impossible for the telegraph service in this country to be run on a paying basis.  For social reasons we must have a telegraph system spread through the country.  It is necessary for social reasons that it would be possible to communicate rapidly with people living in the remotest parts, and it is necessary that   these people should be able to communicate with those outside.  Consequently it is not possible to cut off the telegraph service in some areas in which it is less remunerative than in others and simply to let the telephones have the entire field in these districts.  It is necessary, as far as I can see, to maintain the telegraph service very much as it is.  Reductions may be effected from time to time.  Certain telegraph offices might be closed and certain economies effected, but in the main the telegraph system has to stay where it is, and some subsidy will have to be paid out of the proceeds of general taxation in order to enable the telegraph service to be continued. 
     But it seems to me that the subsidy at present being paid is too great.  The average cost of each telegram handed in at the Saorstat Post Office is 2/7.  The average receipt per telegram is 1/31⁄2.; so that for each telegram handed in there is a loss of 1/31⁄2d., or where you take a 1/- telegram really there is a loss of 1/-.  It seems to me that the subsidy is too high.  If circumstances were different, if money were plentiful, if the yield of taxation were increasing, and if it was possible to expend considerable sums in keeping these services cheap, it might be a very good thing to do so, but at present we feel that too much is being expended out of general taxation, and it is proposed, as I indicated, to increase the minimum charge from 1/- to 1/6.  That will about have the loss which is at present being incurred on telegrams.  There are things in the Bill such as the increased charge on Christmas Days, Good Fridays and Sundays.  Those extra charges are at present in force. 
     
      
       I presume the Minister has considered, in making this increase, that there will possibly be a diminution in the number of telegrams sent.  Has he estimated what that diminution will be?  I would also ask the Minister if, in arriving at the figure that he has stated, namely, that he hopes that the loss will be halved, has he taken this into consideration? He must be aware that he is taking   somewhat of a risk in this matter.  I wonder are the calculations that he has made, made on a sound basis?  The telegraph service, as he says, is, in a sense, a social service, but it is also very important from the point of view of trade, and, while he admits that there must always be a certain amount of subsidy from the general taxation for that purpose, I do not know that the amount is so very excessive, even the amount that is required and paid now.  I would like to hear from the Minister what is the nature of the arrangements, if any, that at present exist between the British Government and the Government of the Saorstat in regard to the despatch of telegrams inter se, that is, between the two States. 
       I would like to hear whether any new arrangement has been come to as a result of this proposed increase on the rate of charge for telegrams here. In other words, will it be possible to send a telegram in England at a lesser rate and have it delivered within the Saorstat?  Presumably, it will be.  But if it is possible, who will pay the extra amount?  Will the contribution be made from the British Exchequer or will we have to bear the loss upon this side?  I do not know, as I say, what the exact arrangement is at the moment, but I think it would be useful, from the point of view of information, if the Minister could tell the House what the present arrangement is, how the money is allocated as between the two Exchequers, and what, if any, arrangement he has come to, with regard to the increase which he proposes to make.  It would be an interesting state of affairs to find that if you are in the City of Dublin you will have to pay 1/6 to send a telegram to Cork, but if you are 60 miles away, in Holyhead, you will have to pay only 1/-.  I think that will require a little explanation. 
     
     
      
       It is the intention of Deputies on this side of the House to oppose this Bill.  We do not think that the state of affairs in the Post Office, revealed to us by the Parliamentary Secretary during the debate on the Estimate for that service, is such as to   justify any additional charge being made for the services which are being given, nor do we think that the benefit which can accrue to the Exchequer as a result of the increase will be sufficient to compensate for the extra charge which people will have to pay for sending telegrams.  It is estimated that the saving which will be effected by the increase will be £66,000.  That is a considerable sum, and the saving of it is a matter to which Deputies should give their attention.  The question we have to ask ourselves is, whether or not the increase is in fact going to produce a saving of £66,000, or, alternatively, if it would not be possible to secure an equal saving by some other means. 
       As Deputy Redmond has pointed out, the estimate of £66,000 is apparently based altogether upon the unjustifiable assumption that there will be no decline in the number of telegrams sent.  Since the debate upon the Estimates for this Department took place, Deputies have been put in the position of having fuller information concerning this service as a result of figures supplied by the Parliamentary Secretary on the 16th May in reply to a question by Deputy Good.  A simple calculation made on these figures would indicate that if the number of telegrams handled by the Post Office after this increased charge has been imposed was to decrease by two-fifths the entire saving estimated would be wiped out.  That calculation does not take into account the fact pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary, that the unit loss on telegrams will be greater as the service decreases. 
     
     We have had many statements concerning this service given us by the Minister for Finance, the Parliamentary Secretary, and the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  To the uninitiated these statements appear to be in conflict.  It has been stated that the telegraph service is a declining one. On the other hand, the Parliamentary Secretary told us that it is not a dying service, and the figures given concerning the number of telegrams handled during the last year and previous years would indicate that perhaps the term &ldquo;declining&rdquo; is no more correct than the   term dying as applied to it.  The rate of decline appears to have been slowing up very considerably from year to year. There was a decrease of 251,000 in the number of telegrams sent in the year 1924-5 as compared with 1923-4, while the decrease in 1927-8, as compared with 1926-7, was only 87,000.  The diminution in the decline has been steady.  It would appear that when conditions get right in the service the decrease will stop altogether, and that it would be possible to review the service with a firmer basis for calculations concerning it. 
     The number of foreign telegrams handled has increased considerably since 1923.  Since 1924 there has also been a substantial increase in the number of Press telegrams.  The question, therefore, arises whether the attitude which the Ministry are taking up towards this service and the loss on it is a correct one.  We have seen that there is a decided possibility that the decreased use of the service resulting from the increased charge will completely wipe out any possible saving and may, in fact, increase the loss.  It is for Deputies to consider whether or not the actual saving which the Minister hopes to get could not be achieved by some other method than by increasing the charge. 
     As I said, we are placed in a difficult position for the purpose of making calculations by the conflicting statements concerning the service which have been made.  It was, for example, stated frequently, I think, by the Minister for Finance and certainly by the Parliamentary Secretary, that one of the main reasons for the loss was that the increased use of the telephone in and around Dublin city had taken from the Post Office the most remunerative part of the service, that is, the short-distance telegrams.  But it appears from the figures supplied in answer to Deputy Good's question that the receipts from the telegraph service in Dublin city from 1923 to 1927-8 decreased by £10,600, out of a total amount received in 1927-8 of £53,000.  The decrease in receipts from the service in the rest of the country was only £33,700 out of a total in 1927-8 of £168,600.  In other   words, the decrease in Dublin city was only one-third of that in the rest of the country, and the actual receipts in Dublin city were one-third of the receipts in the rest of the country.  It would appear, therefore, that the rate of decline in Dublin city has been exactly the same as in the rest of the country, and that the loss on the telegraph service cannot be ascribed to the cause stated. 
     When, however, we turn to the next table given showing the expenses of the telegraph service during the same years, we note a great difference between the figures.  The expenses in Dublin City for 1923-4 were £152,600, and in 1927-8 £124-500, a decrease of 20 per cent. approximately.  The expenses of the service for the rest of the Saorstat for 1923-4 amounted to £457,935, and they had gone down to £277,100 in 1927-8, a decrease of almost 50 per cent.  It would appear, therefore, that while the receipts from the service have been decreasing at the same rate in the rest of the country as in Dublin, the expenses have been reduced by 50 per cent. in the rest of the country, and by only about 20 per cent in Dublin. 
     I think it will be admitted that the main expenditure on this service is on the salaries of the officials.  We must assume, therefore, that there has been a rather drastic reduction in the number of officials employed throughout the rest of the country that has not been reproduced in the city.  If the economy campaign has resulted in a decline in the service, as apparently it has, we are forced to the conclusion that the Ministry are on the wrong track concerning it.  They are complaining about the decline in the service, and have attempted to compensate for that by creating the very position which is going to make the decline more noticeable; that is, by reduction of staffs in the country. 
     There is another matter on which I should like the Minister to give us additional information.  He informed us that the average cost per telegram was 2/7, while the Parliamentary Secretary stated that the average cost was 2/5, and that the receipts per telegram were 1/31⁄2, and that there was   a loss of 1/- on each telegram.  In the case of Press telegrams, however, for which the charge, I think, is only 2d. per dozen words, a calculation based upon the figures supplied would indicate that the loss per telegram is only 91⁄4d.  As it must actually cost the Post Office the same amount to send a Press telegram as an ordinary telegram, we would like to have some explanation as to the reason for the loss upon ordinary telegrams being so much in excess of the loss upon Press telegrams. 
     
      
       On a point of explanation, I think the figures given for Press telegrams were for pages and not for the number of telegrams&mdash;they were calculated per the number of pages. 
     
     
      
       The statement here then is not rigidly correct&mdash;it was not the number of telegrams sent? 
     
     
      
       It was the number of pages sent.  If it is given as the number of telegrams sent it is wrong. 
     
     
      
       The actual number of Press telegrams sent would probably exceed the number given here. 
     
     
      
       It would probably be less, but it is difficult to say. 
     
     
      
       There is no indication in the figures given us, either by the Minister or by the Parliamentary Secretary, as to what percentage of the loss is accounted for by the headquarters expenses in connection with this service.  The Minister will, I hope, appreciate the fact that there are a number of Deputies seriously concerned regarding the amazing increase which has taken place in the headquarters cost of this service.  As I pointed out, during the debate on the Estimate, there has been a decrease of 1,240 in the total number of officials employed by the Post Office.  But that decrease in the total number of officials took place while the number of officials employed at headquarters was increased by 316.  The increases in the different departments from the year   1923 to the year 1928 are as follows:&mdash; Headquarters officers&mdash;from 313 to 406, an increase of 93; Secretary's Office&mdash;from 112 to 131, an increase of 19; Accountant's Office&mdash;from 200 to 273, an increase of 73; Stores Department&mdash;from 114 to 164, an increase of 50; Engineering Establishment&mdash;from 489 to 570, an increase of 81.  When we see a Department building up a huge headquarters staff like this and building that huge headquarters staff up while at the same time it is curtailing the service it is rendering to the public, and when that same Department comes to us for an Act to give them authority to increase the charges for these services, we are forced to the conclusion that it is the old story of the Rake's Progress and that there is something wrong; that this Department is being handled on unbusinesslike lines and that the only solution which they can devise, when they meet with a deficit at the end of the year, is to increase the charges instead of decreasing the expenses.  It is the considered opinion of this Party that the Post Office can be run as a paying proposition without any decrease whatever in the service which is at present being rendered to the people.  That conclusion has been arrived at on the strength of the figures made available to us.  No effective answer to that statement has been made by any Minister or representative of the Government during the debates that have taken place concerning this matter. 
     
     As regards the Telegraph Service, the actual loss has been decreasing every year.  As the Parliamentary Secretary himself boasted during his speech on the Estimates, the loss during the present year is estimated at £167,000, as against £406,000 in 1922-23 and £178,000 in 1924-25.  In this particular service, the amount of the annual loss has been steadily decreasing. There are other services of the Post Office in which the annual loss has been steadily increasing.  About the efficiency of one of these services, Ministers and others have been always boasting&mdash;that is the Telephone Service, the loss on which has gone up from £3,000 in 1924 to £42,000 last year.  During the debate on the Estimates. I stated that the Telephone Service   during the year 1924-25 was run at a gain of £17,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary informed me that my statement was not correct.  My statement was based upon a statement made in this House by the predecessor of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;Mr. Walsh, who was at that time Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It would appear from that that Ministerial Estimates can be altered to suit the particular argument that is being advanced at the moment.  Since I made that statement, I have looked up the records and I have verified it.  In 1925, in the debate on the Estimate, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of that time stated that during the previous year there had been a gain of £17,000 realised on the Telephone Service.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs now informs us that that is not the case.  We are, therefore, faced with the fact that we cannot place absolute reliance on the figures given us, and it is impossible to arrive at accurate calculations. 
     
      
       On a point of explanation, I have not seen the quotation from the speech of the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in regard to the telephone gain.  Possibly the explanation is that the Minister stated that the decrease in loss amounted approximately to £17,000. The Deputy will find that the loss decreased from 1922-23 to 1923-24 by something like £21,000.  Possibly, at that time he was estimating a decreased loss of £17,000.  As far as the reliability of the figures is concerned, the figures are given in the commercial accounts which are available to every Deputy as soon as published.  There is no doubt about the figures being available and being correct.  The Deputy has not taken into account the decrease in the telephone charges which took place in 1925. 
     
     
      
       I am not questioning the accuracy of the figures which the Parliamentary Secretary has now given us up to the year 1926-27&mdash;the last year for which the commercial accounts are available.  Deputies who were present in the House when the then Minister for   Posts and Telegraphs was making that speech on the Estimate had not got the commercial accounts for that year. There was no ambiguity about the words he used.  He said there were two Post Office services which had paid &mdash;the ordinary inland post and the telephone service.  He gave figures which showed that on the telephone service a gain of £17,000 was realised.  I admit he was wrong in that&mdash;just as much wrong as the Parliamentary Secretary may be about the figures he gave us this year. 
     
     
      
       I stand over all my figures. 
     
     
      
       When a Department that anyone with a superficial knowledge can see is run with a rapidly growing headquarters establishment, run in a manner that would not inspire confidence in anybody&mdash;when that Department comes to this House and asks permission to increase its charges without giving a satisfactory explanation as to why that increase is necessary, beyond the statement that there has been a deficit on the service, it is up to this House to refuse it that permission, and to tell it to go back, re-organise the service and effect a saving in some other way. 
     
     
      
       When the Minister introduced his Budget I opposed this increase in the cost of telegrams, which he says is going to bring in extra revenue of £66,000.  I intend to oppose this Bill for several reasons.  My first reason is that I do not believe that the increase from a 1/- to 1/6 for a telegram is going to bring in £66,000 extra revenue.  I think the Minister said, in introducing the Budget, that telegrams were only sent for congratulatory and frivolous purposes, and were not generally used for business purposes.  I consulted some businessmen who are not in a very large way.  In my own town I found that a businessman, by reason of this increased charge for telegrams, will have his costs increased to the tune of £50 per year. 
     
     Like Deputy Lemass, I have always been mystified by these Post Office figures.  To be perfectly frank, I do not believe, when the Parliamentary Secretary   tells us what the cost of a telegram is or the cost of conveying newspapers, postcards or letters is, and when he segregates all these figures, that we can rely for a moment on their accuracy.  When the Minister is replying perhaps he would tell us how he makes up the cost of a telegram at 2/7.  Does he charge against the cost of the telegraph service the salaries of all those who are telegraphists, but who also do other work in the Post Office?  In many post offices, telegraphists may only be occupied for about ten minutes during the day in the sending of telegrams.  For the remainder of the day they are otherwise occupied.  Is it by the mere fact that they are telegraphists, engaged for a short time each day in sending telegrams, that the whole of their salary is charged against the telegraph service? For the remainder of the day, in many of the post offices at least, they may be engaged at ordinary counter work.  I believe it is in that way these figures are arrived at, and that it is that fact that explains the high cost of sending telegrams.  When the Minister was speaking I did not catch very well what he said, but I thought he stated that it was possible to have this question of the telegraphs put on a paying basis. 
     
      
       I said it was impossible. 
     
     
      
       If that is so, then I have nothing further to say on that. To put the matter in a nutshell, I agree with what Deputy Lemass has said with regard to the figures for the Post Office.  I intend to oppose this Bill, the effect of which will be to put an extra tax on business people.  As regards telegrams sent for frivolous purposes, such as congratulations about a birth in a family or something of that sort, the people who send these can well afford to bear the extra cost. The position with regard to this Bill is, that the State is going to lose revenue amounting to £66,000 a year, while at the same time the effect of it will be to put an extra tax on business. 
     
     
      
       Apart altogether from the question of increasing taxation   on a certain class of people who perhaps do not engage very much in the sending of telegrams, there is in my opinion a decided unfairness in the matter of the sending of telegrams to people who live a certain distance, say, three miles from the nearest post office.  In the past these people have had to pay according to the distance they lived from the post office at the rate of so much per mile for the delivery of telegrams.  I know a number of small traders who have to pay a fee of 2/- for the delivery of each telegram. In the future, the sender of the telegram will pay 1/6, and for delivery over a certain distance there will be a charge of 2/-, bringing the total cost up to 3/6.  We are now told that the average cost to the State of sending a telegram is 1/71⁄2.  Therefore, as regards the sending and delivery of telegrams, such as I am referring to, the State will be overpaid as regards each telegram sent to the extent of the difference between 3/6 and 1/71⁄2.  I am entirely opposed to the increase.  I agree with Deputies who have already spoken and who have expressed the view that this increased charge will lead to a decrease in revenue.  The increase, I believe, will lead to less business being done in the telegraph service. 
     
     I feel that Deputies in all parts of the House will admit that the class of people to whom I have been referring, as regards the charges made on them for the delivery of telegrams, have been unfairly treated.  They live in remote areas, at considerable distances from the Post Office.  The charges made on them for the delivery of telegrams in the past were certainly excessive and now they are going to be made much more excessive.  They will not alone have to pay more for the sending of the telegram, but, in addition, will have to pay a certain definite amount which the State, or others who are more favourably situated than they are, will get the benefit of.  In the rural areas all postal facilities have been very much curtailed.  The salaries of the rural postmen have been unduly reduced, while in many areas the delivery of letters has been reduced to three days a week.  On top of that there is now this increased charge for   telegrams.  The result of all this will be that, to a very large extent, you will be eliminating the facilities that go to make country life bearable.  You are taking away from people in the rural areas certain of the conveniences that they very much need.  I am decidedly opposed to this Bill from the point of view that its provisions will operate unfairly against those living in country areas. 
     
      
       I hope Deputies will realise that the passing of this Bill is going to make a very great change in business.  It will mean that the average business message, sent by people living 50 or 60 miles apart, is going in the future to be sent over the telephone instead of over the telegraph wire.  We all know that the trunk service is the least satisfactory part of the telephone service.  I would like to know if the telephone service is prepared to bear the huge increase in business that is going to take place following the change proposed in this Bill.  In my opinion, it is not.  The Government has repeatedly expressed the wish that the telephone service should be popularised.  I suggest that this Bill is going to produce a contrary effect.  The effect of it will be to make the telephone service very unpopular. It will mean a huge increase in traffic over the telephones.  That will be the inevitable effect of this change, and I think it is a change in the wrong direction. It is a commonplace remark among people nowadays that letter writing is unpopular.  No one wants to write a letter.  In my opinion, if the telegraph service could be availed of at a reasonable rate people, instead of writing letters, would use it and there would be a very great increase in the amount of work done in that particular branch of the Post Office.  We think that it would be a much better experiment to lower the present rates for telegrams.  In view of the circumstances that prevail at present, we could not possibly support this Bill. 
     
     
      
       I just want to deal with a few points that have   been made by Deputies.  I do not want to go into the Bill in any detail, as that is the function of the Minister for Finance.  Many of the points raised by Deputies could, I think, have been more appropriately raised when the Estimate for the Department was before the House than on a Bill of this nature.  Deputy Lemass quoted a great many figures.  He quoted from a tabular statement.  In order to deal adequately with the matters that he raised, one would need to have the opportunity of examining that tabular statement. It is not possible to answer offhand criticisms made from a tabular statement.  I am sure the Deputy does not want wide statements and generalisations. We want to be accurate, and so far as the figures I have given are concerned, they are accurate, except where we are dealing with approximations in regard to years for which we have not yet got the final conclusive figures.  Deputy O'Hanlon made a point with regard to the method by which we arrive at the allocation of the costs of the different services, and he doubts the accuracy of our figures. I must acknowledge that to a certain extent figures of this kind must be approximations, for we had to deal with the allocation of the time of the officials, but these approximations are the result of years of very careful examination into the amount of time spent by the officials on the different services. Inquiries were made in Great Britain and in this country, the results of which have been confirmed by inquiries we have made since we took over the service in this country.  I think the Deputy may take it that for all practical purposes the figures are approximately correct. 
     
     Another point made by Deputy Lemass, and which should also have been dealt with on the Estimates rather than on this particular Bill, is that our headquarters staff has increased to a very considerable extent.  I pointed out in the Estimates that if the Deputy examines the amounts paid in salaries he will find that a considerable amount was paid for a temporary staff, and that the numbers of the temporary staff were not included in the total of the headquarters staff.  In the Estimate of   the Accounts Branch of the Post Office, and in the figures given of the number employed, he will find there is an increase in the personnel of the permanent staff and a decrease in the amount spent on the temporary staff.  When we were building up the headquarters staff it was not thought advisable to appoint established or permanent officials until such time as we had a grip of things. The argument that the telegraphic service could be made pay at the present rate of charges is discounted by the figures available here and in other countries. A commission was recently set up in England to inquire into the reason for the deficit in the telegraph service. The deficit there is considerable, and the service in Great Britain should be more remunerative than ours, because it being a thickly populated country naturally a greater number of telegrams would be going over the wires, and a greater use made of the service of the officials.  Still, on close examination it is shown that a considerable loss is being made annually in the telegraphic service in Great Britain, and, taking into account the conditions there as compared with the conditions here, it can be shown that the loss here is relatively no greater than in Great Britain, and is perhaps even less. Deputy Lemass made the further point that the decrease in use of the telegraphic service is largely due to the fact that people are using the telephone to a greater extent for short distance messages.  As regards the decrease which has taken place in telegrams from Dublin, there is also a corresponding decrease in the telegrams sent all over the country. 
     Deputy Lemass argued that there was the possibility in the near future without increasing the charge for telegrams of reducing, if not altogether wiping out, the loss on the telegraph service.  I think the Deputy gave figures showing the extent of the decrease on the telegraphic service.  It has decreased to a considerable extent since 1922.  The actual loss on a telegram in 1923 was 1/9 and the loss in 1927-28 on a telegram was 1/3.  As I pointed out in the Estimates, we have now reached a stage where any further   substantial decrease cannot be brought about in the expenditure on the Post Office service.  We have almost reached a static position.  So far as the telegraphic service is concerned, we have almost reached the position where no further decrease in the cost can be expected, at least any considerable amount.  That being the case, it does not seem possible that any efforts which we may make towards a reduction of expenses can bring about a state of affairs where the telegraphic service will be a paying proposition.  If the Deputy takes into account that the loss on the telegraphic side of the Post Office service amounts to practically half the total loss on the service, he will understand it is not justifiable in the interests of the Post Office that that loss should be continued unless the Dail and the Government decide definitely that the Post Office is to be administered as a subsidised service.  I understood Deputies on the other side to say that in their view the Post Office service ought to be a paying service. 
     
      
       And can be. 
     
     
      
       Ought to be.  If that is the policy it does not seem conceivable this branch of the Post Office service can be a paying one.  As I have said, the figures in proof of this argument are not confined to this country. As a matter of fact, the commission which sat in Great Britain recommended an increase in the telegraphic service to a minimum which will be greater than the increase recommended in this Bill.  They recommended a minimum charge of 1/7 per telegram. 
     
     
      
       I introduced this Bill myself instead of the Parliamentary Secretary because it is part of the Budget, and the considerations are financial.  There is no additional charge being imposed on the taxpayer, but what we are doing is we are charging more to the people who are getting the service and so relieving the people who are not getting the service.  If we do not get this £66,000 from the telegraph service we must get it from something else.  If this Bill were not to go through some other proposal for taxation would have to be introduced in   substitution for it.  The number of telegrams sent is about one per head of the population per annum.  The trader to whom Deputy O'Hanlon referred must be sending something like 2,000 per annum.  There is no reason why he should be subsidised to the length of something like from 1/- to 1/3 per telegram.  I have admitted that because a large portion of the telegram services are maintained purely for social reasons that there must be some subsidy from the Exchequer towards the telegraph system, but I think the subsidy paid is altogether beyond what is justified.  I think we should reduce the draw on the Exchequer by making the people who use the service pay more to make up for what it costs. 
     
     
      
       Does that apply to the newspaper proprietors? 
     
     
      
       With regard to the newspaper proprietors, if we were to deal with the Press telegrams, I think we would have to deal with a wider problem.  I would like to say that I think it very undesirable that there should be, as there are, large numbers of people in this country who read only a foreign daily paper.  I think where you have a democratic country it is very bad to have large numbers of people getting their news and views entirely from foreign papers.  We know the home papers are faced with tremendous competition.  Undoubtedly they have certain advantages, but they are faced with tremendous competition, and so long as such outside papers have the advantage of cheap telegraph services, I certainly would not care to increase that charge here, unless we are taking certain other steps&mdash;that is, unless there was such a thing as a tariff on imported newspapers or something of that nature. 
     
     
      
       Does not the same argument apply to all business concerns? 
     
     
      
       No, not at all, because the telegram is incidental to the other businesses.  It is the actual transport of goods for the newspaper, and it is a much more important factor. 
     
     
      
       The raw material has to be cooked afterwards. 
     
     
     
      
       Deputy Redmond asked about the diminution of telegrams. The Post Office believe that there will be only a small reduction in the number of telegrams sent, and that it will be possible to offset the loss of revenue in that respect to a large extent by certain economies that may be made possible.  With regard to the arrangement for the sending of telegrams to Great Britain, at present the arrangements for foreign telegrams do not apply, and the receipts for telegrams between the two countries are divided.  The British some time ago pressed for the opening of negotiations in regard to the present arrangements. This Deputy may have seen that a commission or committee which sat in England recommended that the present arrangement between the two countries should be brought to an end, and that the ordinary foreign rates arrangement should be brought into operation.  The position is that the negotiations in regard to telegrams sent between the Saorstat and Great Britain are under consideration. 
     
     I think that the other points that were raised have been dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary, except the question of charges for delivery. We recognise that the present delivery charges are perhaps hard on people in certain areas, and we are considering some rearrangement which can be made to relieve people to some extent at a comparatively small cost to the Post Office.  I hope that it will be possible at any rate to modify the arrangements so that in some remote areas people will not be quite as heavily burdened in respect of delivery fees as they are at the present time.  The loss on the Post Office&mdash;I think this has been dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;has been reduced during recent years, and there has not been that piling up of headquarters staffs that the Deputy suggests, because he was dealing only with the figures of permanent staffs.  Large temporary staffs whose numbers were not given in the earlier estimates have been to a large extent replaced by permanent staffs, so that the figures from year to year were not really comparable figures.  It would not be possible to   effect this saving in respect of telegrams by any sort of internal change. It can only be effected by the method we propose.  We regard this method of making the people who get and who send telegrams pay something more as being better than putting an additional impost of some sort on the general taxpayer. 
     
      
       There is just one question which I omitted to ask the Minister which I would like to ask now.  Has he considered whether a reduction in the present rate for telegrams might not mean an actual increase in the revenue which will be   derived from them?  Let me take as an example the case of the liquor duties, where, if there was a reduction, there would probably be an increased consumption. Would there not be an increased revenue derived if there was an actual reduction made in the rates for telegrams instead of an increase as the Minister now proposes? 
     
     
      
       As in the case of the reduction in the liquor duties, there would be an increased loss. 
     
     
      
       I doubt that very much.

     IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - ESTIMATES FOR PUBLIC SERVICES.   VOTE 40&mdash;OFFICE OF THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH (RESUMED). 
     Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash; 
     That a sum not exceeding £269,556 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, including Grants and other expenses in connection with Housing, Grants to Local Authorities, and Sundry Grants in Aid, and the Expenses of the Office of the Inspector of Lunatic Asylums. 
     
      
       took the Chair. 
     
     
      
       I understand that during the previous debates on this Vote reference was made to the shortage of houses.  I want to direct the Minister's attention to the acute shortage of houses in Cork city, and, I might say, well outside the city into the rural areas.  It may be said that housing schemes were started, that two have been completed, that another one is under way, and that that has done something to relieve the housing shortage in Cork.  I can tell the Minister that they have made no perceptible difference so far as the housing shortage is concerned.  It may be thought that I am overstating the position, but I can tell the Minister that the rents of the houses that were erected so far are such that no workman could afford to take one of them. Again, in the second building scheme, which included something like 100 houses, they were not let; they were sold.  It must be the experience of the Minister, as it is mine and that of most Deputies, that very few of the working-class people can afford to buy their own houses.  We know from the statistics of unemployment and also from the seasonal occupations of the majority of the people, that they cannot afford to buy their own houses.  As a matter of fact, it   is the exception rather than the rule for the ordinary working man to have a house which he has purchased.  It might be thought that this question is one that peculiarly affects the cities and towns, but I have an amount of correspondence, which I do not intend to read now, dealing with the housing shortage in Cork city borough.  On the occasion of the President's visit to the city, as he was very busy I did not want to inflict upon him a large number of deputations, but amongst those who wished to interview him were residents within the borough, but outside the city proper.  In the village of Lower Tower, which is only a few miles from the city, there are families living under conditions that are not fit for a decent dog to live under.  I could quote dozens of cases, but I will mention one case in the village of Lower Tower to illustrate in some way what the housing shortage means in the rural areas.  One house is occupied by a man, his wife, a grown daughter and two smaller children, as well as his brother-in-law, his wife, three grown daughters and a younger son.  When I tell the House that there are only three rooms in that little cottage, Deputies can conceive what the position must be like, living under such, shall I say, hygienic conditions.  That case is just typical of most of the correspondence that I receive in connection with the housing shortage. 
     
     I understand that it is competent for the Minister to re-condition old military barracks, and I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that we have in the borough of Cork a disused military barracks which, at very little expense, could be made habitable, and in a small way would help to solve the housing difficulty.  Long discussions took place at the public boards of Cork at one time relative to the housing question. As Deputies are aware, a very large sum of money was awarded by the British Government for the destroyed City Hall.  I may say that I was one of those who occupied a public position at the time, and I acquiesced in the transfer of that money to the building scheme.  I did so believing then, as I do now, that while a certain aesthetic value might obtain in regard to the City Hall,   or a building of that kind, from the point of view of utility I appreciated the fact that housing at that particular period was more important for the health of the citizens than the erection of the City Hall.  The houses that I refer to were built with that British money, but these houses have not solved the shortage so far as the working-class people of the city are concerned.  What do we find in practice?  Many people who were living in expensive flats were able to move into these houses, whether by the favour of the Corporation in the old days or not I cannot say, as the Corporation was then very useful to its friends in giving them houses, even though the rents were pretty high.  In the second and third schemes, and particularly in the Capwell site, the people who went into the houses there were people who could well afford to build houses for themselves.  So far as housing is concerned, I do not think the erection of these houses has in any way perceptibly relieved the situation as far as Cork is concerned.  I consider that we in Cork were let down very badly by the Commissioner and by all concerned in the allocation, or the misappropriation, as I now say, of this money which was given by the British Government for the destruction of the City Hall, and which was used for the building of houses for people who could very well afford to build them themselves.  I could go on and put up a good case in other matters under the heading of this Vote, but I prefer to confine myself to the housing question.  Some of the matters that I could refer to would be just as appropriate under the Education Vote as under this one.  I want to emphasise the fact that, so far as the action of the Department towards housing in Cork is concerned, the situation has not been relieved in any perceptible way.  I hope that the Minister will be able to say that the old barracks at Ballincollig may be re-conditioned, seeing that it can be done at a very small cost. and that in future schemes of housing he will see that the name &ldquo;working-class dwellings&rdquo; will not be the misnomer it is at present. 
     
      
       I had no intention of intervening in this debate until I heard   the speech of my learned colleague in the representation of the City of Cork. Frankly, I think it is very unfair of him to take this opportunity of stating a case on behalf of himself or of his Party with regard to a position for which he himself and his Party have more responsibility probably than any other Party in this House.  When the Commissioner system was adopted we in the City of Cork might have been in a position to have vigorously contested the actions of the Commissioner system, but the first people that gave a democratic title to the Commissioner in Cork were the Labour Party.  They by their absolute free consent gave the Commissioner a full title to do what they state to-day was a misappropriation of the funds allocated for the building of the City Hall, for the purpose of building working-class dwellings. And since they did give him that title &mdash; and let us be fair, in this House at any rate &mdash; he used that fund for the building of dwellings in the only manner that he could possibly use it under the circumstances, and that was to build houses, and at the same time create a sinking fund to reimburse in the quickest possible way the fund from which he had taken the money. The only way in which he could do that was by building houses and giving them for a deposit with rent, plus an amount that would cover the capital expenditure.  I am not agreeing that the Commissioner was right in building houses with money that was definitely allocated for the building of the City Hall, but since he has done it he has built houses under the only possible conditions by which he could get the money back within a reasonable time for the building of the City Hall, which everyone in Cork demands to-day. Nobody gave him a quicker title than the Labour Party in the city, and it is unfair for Labour Deputies to criticise the Commissioner on that particular question to-day. 
     
     The case against the Commissioner is that he has not built dwellings for the working classes.  I am going to admit &mdash; and I will be the first to admit it, since I was in a similar position myself &mdash; that it is very hard to-day to   build a house and let it at an economic rent that will bring it within the possible purchasing power, or even the rental power, of the ordinary working man.  But I am going to separate two classes, for one of which the Labour Party, if they were able to form a Government in the morning, could not build houses.  They could build them for the working classes, and the working classes only.  The working classes are not in a position to pay perhaps twelve or ten shillings a week, but they are prepared to pay a reasonable rent, which in my opinion would be between seven shillings and eight shillings. Taking into account the average wage paid in the city, that would be a reasonable rent, and they are as well able to afford proportionately to pay that as the ordinary businessman in the city is able to pay his rent out of the profits of his business. 
     There are two distinctions under which the working classes must come&mdash; those who have a week's employment for a week's wages, and those who are not employed for a full week.  I am not going to defend the man who has a full week's wage; the person I am trying to accommodate is the man who cannot get a full week's wage and who cannot pay a high rent.  In my opinion that is where the Minister has really failed, perhaps by an oversight, perhaps because his Department is definitely out to work within its Budget for the year.  Surely if the Minister could state honestly to the House that his expenditure had exceeded his income because he had given additional moneys for the relief of the distressed poor, is there an individual Deputy in any party who would stand up and object?  Is there an individual Deputy who would, for instance, defend the Department's system of giving one week's relief, stopping it for two weeks, and giving it again on the fourth week?  It is not a question of working within your Estimate.  It is a question of your Estimate being conscientiously expended in the best interests of people who deserve to have the Irish people's money expended for their benefit. 
     Again, reference has been made to barracks in the city of Cork.  Let it   be understood on behalf of the dissolved Corporation that we have negotiated with, I think, the Department that the President had the honour to be at one time Minister of when he was Minister for Local Government, and we were prepared to exchange one barracks, which was used in the old and better days as an ordinary police court, and which was corporate property, for other property that was held under the British Government, and that was transferred to the Free State Government under the terms of the Treaty&mdash; the Catfort Barracks.  That barracks is to-day in exactly the same position. You have there one of the most healthy sites in the city, and because you have the stone, and certain other materials close at hand, there would be a reasonable possibility of building small dwellings within the reach of the ordinary workman's wages.  I think if that particular case were definitely brought under the notice of the Minister, and that if he could re-open negotiations with the powers that be, we could at any rate build a certain number of houses that would relieve the position of some of the people who are living in houses where they often have to take the clothing off their beds and stuff it where the slates should be when the clerk of the weather does not favour them. 
     I do not know if I am quite in order in raising the question of amalgamation, or to what extent the Estimate might bring me within order, but it has been raised in the debate.  I frankly say that there is a certain amount of disappointment at present, because we have not yet got an official statement on that question.  I heard Deputy Ward making some very able suggestions on the whole question of amalgamation. I have seen photographs in connection with the visit of the Minister for Local Government to Cork, and I understand that he visited the County Home in the city.  I am only sorry that the Minister did not visit that institution in 1918 or 1919, before the amalgamation, because if he had done so, he would have seen the tremendous difference in the whole working and in the whole atmosphere that existed before   the amalgamation scheme compared with the conditions now. 
     Frankly, in every county they have not administered the amalgamation scheme in the spirit that I personally understood it when it was advocated in the old Republican days, the days of the Republican Government.  That spirit was imbued in me by those who led that Government.  There is in Cork, if in no other county in Ireland, a definite proof that that spirit leads to the solution of proper catering for the poor in this country.  There is, in Cork, a difference between telling a man and trying to force it down his neck that he is a pauper.  There is a difference between, say, the conditions in 1918 and the conditions to-day.  To-day you tell a man that he is a good, decent Irishman who has, unfortunately, at the present moment, become poor, but he is nevertheless entitled in this country to the best respect, to equal respect with other men.  That is the spirit preached from what was formerly called the Cork Union, but what is to-day described as a hospital.  Such conditions are a credit to any nation on the earth. 
     As regards medical treatment, to-day if the conditions are not fully modern, the authorities there have taken steps to make them so.  To-day the patients have violet-ray, X-ray and other modern treatments and, instead of having paupers operated upon on a timber table, they are operated upon on one of the most modern operating tables that science has produced.  That is a big difference.  That was my interpretation of the instructions that were issued to us by the Republican Government prior to 1920.  That was the spirit in which we undertook changes in Cork.  I believe we are on the right road and that there will a day dawn in Ireland when we will see that even though a man is poor he is at least entitled to as much respect as is given to any man who is fortunate enough to have money and who is able to pay for what, under other circumstances, a poor man would not be able to pay for.  The main idea underlying it all is that we shall do our best to help the poor and give them every assistance and respect. 
     
     
      
       Exception has been taken to the cost of the Department here and certain figures have been quoted by some Deputies comparing the cost of the Department at present and the cost of the Department in the British days.  These figures would refute themselves if they were simply looked at and would have no effect on the minds of Deputies except for the general kind of suggestions that various Deputies have made that our staff is overloaded, that the work is overlapping and that there are crowds of inspectors of one kind or another doing a lot of unnecessary work.  I stated, when introducing the Estimate, that the cost of running the Department had decreased steadily from 1922 down.  In fact, the decrease, if I may repeat it again, has been from a staff of 216 in 1922-23 to a staff of 202 in 1927-28. That indicates a decrease of 14, the principal decrease being that there was a reduction from 24 to 18, or a reduction of 6, among the auditor and stock-taker class.  The only people excluded are cleaners and fire attendants of one kind or another.  The total staff cost for the year ended March, 1923, was £103,560, and the total cost in the year ended March, 1928, was £88,001, or a reduction of 15 per cent. 
     
     I do not consider it would fulfil any function here to compare the cost of the Department at present with the cost in British days, but as the question has been raised, and as figures have been quoted here suggesting that there have been enormous increases in the cost of running the Department since British days, it is well that the House would rid its mind of any impression made by these statements.  Deputy Holt took figures which he called figures for 1919, without saying what he meant by 1919, whether that meant the year ended March, 1919, or the year ended March, 1920.  He did not say why he took a year three or four years before the British left here.  If we take headings A. and C., the headings for salaries and wages and the general staff and auditors, and compare these figures for the year 1921-22, the last year that the British were here, with the Estimates   for the present day, we find some interesting figures.  I will give the cost of Local Government in the British days. If we compare the twenty-six counties with the thirty-two counties, it may be taken that 78 per cent. of the expenditure represents the expenditure in respect of the twenty-six counties, and for the year 1921-22 the expenditure under the British under-headings A. and B. was £101,440.  The Estimates for 1928-29 under the same heading total £90,385, a reduction of 11 per cent. During the same year, 1921-22, there was a Dail expenditure of £18,706, but as compared with the expenditure in 1921-22 by the British, the cost of wages in the Local Government Department to-day shows a reduction of 11 per cent. If you combine the Dail expenditure and the British expenditure in 1921-22, there is a reduction of 33 per cent.  If the pre-war cost of salaries in the year 1914-15 is taken it can be shown that, taking into consideration the increased cost of money, there is a reduction of 9.1 per cent in the cost of the wages of the staff, as compared with the British expenditure then. 
     With regard to the total expenditure of the running of the Department, if you take the headings A. to H.  (2) you will find that the total Estimate for 1928-29 is £103,422.  The total expenditure in respect of the twenty-six counties by the British in 1921-22 under the same headings was £110,216.  We show there a reduction of £6,794, a reduction of 6.1 per cent.  We took over the Dail staffs as well as the British staffs, and if we want to know what the reduction as against the combined British and Dail staffs of 1922 is, we find it is 21.4 per cent.  Substantial reductions have taken place in the running of the Department, in spite of the fact that during these years big responsibilities in the matter of housing, road construction, and other things were shouldered by the Department, and very big work was done in connection with the amalgamation schemes and the doing away with the Rural District Councils. 
     There has been an increase of expenditure. Deputy Holt tells you that there has been an increase of 300 per cent.  We are charged, in so far as we are chargeable, with an increase in expenditure   for the reason that if you take those headings, Child Welfare, Medical Treatment for School Children, Grants for the Provision of School Meals.  Welfare of the Blind, and Treatment of Tuberculosis, and the general expenditure under public welfare work like that, you will see that our estimate this year, for these services, amounts to £92,509 as against £49,853 in the last year that the British were here and there was no expenditure at all in 1914-15 under this head.  We admit an increased expenditure of approximately 100 per cent. under that head. 
     
      
       Well-spent money. 
     
     
      
       As regards housing, the Estimates for housing this year are £181,780 as against £38,345 in 1921-22 and as against nothing at all in 1914-15.  We admit an increased expenditure of 200 per cent. under that particular head. 
     
     
      
       And a decrease on last year's expenditure. 
     
     
      
       A decrease on last year's expenditure, for the reason that the amount of money statutorily set aside by the Dail has been fully allotted and we can only deal here with the expenditure that is involved in the moneys that we have already statutorily allotted to us.  There is nothing to prevent the Dail, when a new housing policy is framed, to vote whatever money is necessary to spend during the current year.  But these Estimates can only deal with the amount of money that we are authorised to deal with, so that we may possibly have to plead to greater expenditure under the housing sub-head this year, and I hope we will. 
     
     
      
       You will not be accused of any offence for so doing. 
     
     
      
       The only Deputy prepared to do it up to the present is Deputy Holt.  I hope then it is clear to the Dail that there have been substantial economies in the organisation of the Department and in the carrying out of the work of the Department.  A number of suggestions have been made that further economies   could be effected if, for instance, all the engineers attached to the Board of Works, to the Post Office and the Local Government Department were lumped together, that a rearrangement of duties might be carried out by reason of which one man could do the work of two or three men. 
     
     
      
       Impossible. 
     
     
      
       We have got rather a vivid description of numbers of inspectors, and inspectors particularly of one kind &mdash; medical inspectors &mdash; travelling down by train to one village, each one of them having to do with a particular piece of work in his own watertight compartment.  The technical staff in the Roads Department of the Local Government Ministry consists of one engineer and three temporary engineers, and it is with that technical staff the whole work of road control is carried out in the Local Government Department.  I want to say that in the first place it is important to focus responsibility, and the responsibility for the roads, in so far as the Local Government Department is concerned, is focussed on one chief engineer and on our three temporary engineers.  I do not think that anyone who has any experience of administration and the getting of work done is going to blur the responsibility of these men.  They cannot be spared to do any of the work that the Board of Works might want, and, certainly, no one who understands the need for responsibility and right supervision would want any other Department to interfere with them.  I do not want any other Department to have any claims on these men. 
     
     
      
       Hear, hear. 
     
     
      
       Apart from the engineers who deal with the roads, we have two engineers whose main responsibility is waterworks, sewage schemes and general engineering works of one kind or another that may arise.  These engineers cannot take on any other duties. 
     
     In the Housing department we have three architects, two temporary architects and one temporary engineer, whose time is fully occupied.  We have   two legal men; and, on the medical side, we have one doctor-in-chief and seven inspectors, one of whom is a specialist in mental hospitals, and one temporary medical inspector.  With that statement and with these figures, I think the House ought to be able to rid its mind of the impressions that have been attempted to be created by some statements that were made here.  There is no Department in the State, I think, that has more the open door in the matter of its organisation and in the facilities given to members of the Dail for knowing what that organisation is and what the officials are doing. 
     
      
       Hear, hear. 
     
     
      
       If we are to avoid introducing that type of friction and that type of diseased imagination, both amongst the ratepaying classes as a whole, who are the local government electors, and amongst the members of the public who undertake to discharge the duties of councillors in our different councils &mdash; if we are going to preserve good relations and confidence in one another in getting local government business done in the country, we ought not to have misleading statements and disturbing suggestions with regard to over-staffing and over-costing made here in the Dail.  These statements are repeated locally and there has been general dissatisfaction stirred up amongst people against the way in which the local government is supposed to be administered.  I do hope that we can get away from frictions that are raised in that particular way. 
     
     Under matters dealing with general public health, there seems to be some misconceptions.  We are charged with not making enough provision in our Estimates for school meals and for child welfare.  The position with regard to school meals and child welfare is that the local bodies are empowered under certain Acts to put schemes into operation, and they draw from the Central Fund 50 per cent. of their total expenditure. Now, the total expenditure of the moneys voted in the present Estimate is entirely controlled by the amount of expenditure that the local bodies will undertake.  Nothing on   our side has been left undone to draw the attention of the urban bodies to the powers that they have vested in them to provide school meals for necessitous school children, and as recently as, I think, October last, their attention was again drawn to the matter&mdash;&mdash; 
     
      
       In the urban areas? 
     
     
      
       Yes, in the urban areas? 
     
     
      
       Why not the rural areas? 
     
     
      
       Well, that is a different matter which can be discussed in its own time.  For the year ending March, 1927, there were two county boroughs and eighteen urban district councils giving these meals in areas involving 59 per cent. of the total urban population.  For the current year school meals will be given in three county boroughs and twenty-eight urban districts, or in urban areas involving 72 per cent. of the total urban population.  That is a fairly substantial increase. 
     
     
      
       Has the Minister any comparative figures in that connection &mdash; has he any figures for 1920? 
     
     
      
       The only figures I have are for 1927 to 1929.  In 1927 there were two county boroughs in the scheme.  In the current year there is an addition of one, so that there will be three county boroughs this year.  For the year ending March, 1927, there were eighteen urban councils actually giving these meals.  There is an increase of ten in the current year.  The facilities were provided in areas involving 59 per cent. of the urban population for the year ending March, 1927, and will be provided in areas involving 72 per cent. of the urban population in the current year.  That is a very definite increase. As regards the number of children geting these meals I have no information by me.  If the Deputy wants further information he can put down a question. I have particulars for Dublin.  For the year 1922-23 there were 31 schools in the scheme, and the average daily number of children was 5,040.  For the year 1926-27 the number of schools was 31, and the daily number of children 6,098,   or an increase of about 1,000.  Criticism in the matter can really only arise in the local areas and ought to be addressed to the local bodies.  There is nothing being left undone on our part to draw the attention of local bodies to the matter. 
       As to child welfare, the same thing applies.  A State grant will be given through local bodies or voluntary agencies.  The number of local bodies administering the scheme is, four county boroughs, three county councils, eighteen urban districts, and four rural districts.  There are, however, 82 voluntary agencies in the country, and there is no county in some part of which there is not a voluntary agency doing some of this work, so that there is no county but is having in practice, in some part of it, brought under the notice of the people the advantages to be gained from this.  Much more can be done by local bodies, and we hope to see that work done. 
     
     I think Deputy Sir James Craig raised the question of infantile mortality.  The position with regard to it is that the death rate in rural Ireland since 1927 has invariably been well below the death rate of rural England, rural Wales or rural Scotland.  The comparative position in 1926 was this: rural Ireland, 56 per thousand; rural England, 60 per thousand; rural Scotland, 90 per thousand. The 56 was reduced here in 1927 to 55.  As a matter of fact, there has been a substantial and steady reduction in infantile mortality in the country, both in rural and urban areas.  The figures for urban areas are: urban England, 73; urban Scotland, 89; urban Ireland, 110; so that we compare very unfavourably in the matter of the death rate in urban areas.  The general comparison is: England and Wales, as a whole, 70; Saorstat Eireann, 74; Scotland, 83.  Our urban conditions are very greatly affected by the position of Dublin County Borough.  A comparison of some urban conditions can be gathered from the following figures: London, 64 per thousand; Edinburgh, 80; Glasgow, 104; Belfast, 112; Derry, 118; Dublin County Borough, 118.  So that in our urban areas there still remains   a very big problem to be faced in connection with infantile mortality. The heart of that problem is Dublin City, and the various factors that affect that problem there are fully under review. 
     But, in general, from 1907 to 1926 there has been a definite decrease in infantile mortality.  The figure per thousand births for children under three months in 1907-10 were 54.3; in 1926 it was 41.6, a reduction of 12.7. Between three and six months, in 1907-10, 16.6; in 1926, 14.5, or a reduction of 2.1. Between six and twelve months in 1907-10 it was 22.7; in 1926, 18.29; a reduction of 3.41. 
     During the period from 1912 to 1926 there has been a decrease in maternal mortality associated with child-birth. In 1912 the rate per thousand was 6.12; in 1926 it was 5.38, or a reduction of .74.  The figure in 1926 was well below the average for some years past. 
     When we come to the question of the medical and dental inspection of school children and sanitation, two of the main matters that were discussed here, we come up against the question of the county medical officer.  County medical officers or officers analagous to them have been appointed in counties Kildare, Carlow, Offaly and Cork, and in Cork City and Dublin City.  In Dublin, Cork and the urban district of Clonmel, there is at present dental, medical and general inspection and treatment of school children.  The work is only started in Dublin, but has been going on for two years in Cork.  The doctor in charge of the work in Cork has published two annual reports in which very important details are given with regard to the work carried out.  Thousands of children are being treated for ailments and defects and these defects have been remedied with very great advantage, we must realise, to their future well-being.  But the general results that are going to accrue to the nation from the medical inspection of school children can only be fully realised when the work has been in operation for a longer period and over a wider area.  It is anticipated that in County Kildare and in County Cork &mdash; that is throughout the county &mdash; the inspection   of school children will be put into operation by July 1st.  But the important part of the problem is the appointment of county medical officers. Deputy Goulding suggested that while the county medical officer is a most important person who will fulfil valuable functions and involve real economy, not only to the rates, but to the nation as a whole, the people are not able to pay for such an office at present, and that the work should devolve on dispensary medical officers. Deputies will realise that it would be much more economic to appoint a county medical officer and make him responsible for the work than to divide the work over the individual dispensary medical doctors and pay them for it.  The expenditure in money in appointing a county medical officer would be much less than if the work was spread over dispensary medical officers, and the work could not be carried out in a properly co-ordinated and intelligent way, I think, by the dispensary medical officers. 
     As to sanitation work, it is a matter of the very greatest importance that we should know the full facts of our backwardness, if we are backward, and in some places we are terribly backward in the urban districts in the matter of sanitation; but we cannot even know that until the county medical officer in each area, with his training, outlook and responsibility, looks right into the position in each county. 
     From the examination that is being made in the counties where county medical officers of health are at work, and from the reports which we expect to receive in due course, it will be apparent that in no way are we, in the first place, interpreting to ourselves the problem in terms of facts, and in the second place, in no way are we going to face the solution of the problem except through the machinery of the county medical officer. 
     
      
       Is the Minister prepared to compel the county councils to appoint county medical officers? 
     
     
      
       Certainly, and the sooner it is done the better, and there are many ways of getting the   thing done.  Very often if you leave a certain situation to develop in a particular direction, you will get a thing done very much quicker by leaving it to develop.  The quickest possible way very often to get a thing done is to create an intense conviction in the minds of the people that the thing ought to be done, and then the thing practically does itself.  But we are not unmindful at all in the Department of our responsibility in this particular matter, and in matters of which this is the key Deputies need not fear in the least that if we have only a small number of county medical officers appointed up to this, that it means the situation is going slower than it need or could go.  I expect there will be quite a number&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Would it be possible to expedite the appointment of the county medical officer of health by ear-marking some of the grants supplied from the Central Fund here? 
     
     
      
       That is a matter for legislation, I think, but I want to have it realised, at any rate, that the Department, in the matter of the county medical officers of health, is going at the fastest possible rate that it can go at the moment.  If Deputies want to speed up that matter they can do it, and a great many Deputies are doing it by creating public opinion in favour of this particular class of medical officer, and by creating public opinion on to the importance of his work, and that he alone can look after it properly. 
     
     
      
       Where Cork leads! 
     
     
      
       The work that has been undertaken in Cork is going to be very much developed soon, and we hope that the work done in Cork and other counties will be an example and an incentive to the people in other places.  But I want to say that in the matter of the importance of our urban sanitation the work is not at a standstill. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that in certain areas the work is at a standstill because of the reluctance of the local ratepayers to find the total cost for the carrying out of certain schemes? 
     
     
     
      
       I am aware in certain areas there is work of this particular class that should be undertaken and which is not undertaken, but to Deputies who declare that the work is at a standstill we reply &ldquo;It is not.&rdquo;  At the present moment there are going on a number of county schemes to the extent of a total cost of £206,453. 
     
     
      
       Is not that because the Minister is subsidising those schemes to some extent? 
     
     
      
       To a certain extent that is so, but the work is not at a standstill. 
     
     
      
       Because of that? 
     
     
      
       It may be because of that, but if the suggestion is made that there must be a State contribution towards the improvement of the sanitary conditions in the various localities throughout the country, I would like to hear that matter very much more fully argued, because it must be realised that the carrying out of the proper work of sanitation is a local responsibility. 
     
     
      
       The Minister has quite ignored the fact that year after year in this House, from every part of it, suggestions in regard to State aid have been put forward.  Speaking for my own locality, I know that urgent schemes are held up simply because that aid is not forthcoming. 
     
     
      
       From my point of view, at any rate, a case has not yet been made that there should be a State contribution to this class of work in the various localities throughout the country. 
     
     
      
       The Minister does not turn down any scheme put forward by the local authorities for sanitation.  He is anxious that schemes should be put forward and he gives them approval.  May I take it that that is the Minister's attitude? 
     
     
      
       Certainly. 
     
     
      
       Yes, but they may not comply with the conditions. 
     
     
      
       Would there be sufficient   money forthcoming from the Local Loans Fund this year to enable any local authority that so desire to carry out such a scheme? 
     
     
      
       I cannot say exactly with regard to the Local Loans Fund, but my impression is that no money is refused from the Local Loans Fund. 
     
     
      
       I agree, but&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I think the Minister ought to be allowed to reply.  No new point ought to be introduced at this stage. 
     
     
      
       This is not a new point; it is very old. 
     
     
      
       I think I am right in what I said.  If I am wrong let any Deputy correct me, and let him point out if there is any case in which a loan was refused from the Local Loans Fund.  The whole attitude of the Department is to encourage this work and to intervene in order to try to get a suitable area of charge.  The area of charge is the difficulty.  I want to say that a case has not yet been made as far as I am concerned that there should be a State Grant for this work.  I do not know how a case could be made in the matter until we have such a review of the situation generally as we can only get when we have our county medical officers of health. 
     
     
      
       How does the Minister justify State assistance already in certain cases? 
     
     
      
       Moneys were voted for relief, and in the allocation of the money for relief in so far as the Local Government Department could influence the situation, relief moneys were allocated to schemes for sanitation and waterworks in various areas. 
       There were two important aspects. One was that constructive and very necessary work and, to a certain extent, reproductive and economic work, was being done, and that by giving grants we were throwing free further moneys for the relief of unemployment in the areas to which we sent grants. 
     
     
        Any moneys that have been given from the State recently for purposes such as this have been given out of the relief grant.  I am speaking now as a matter of general policy that is to be applied all round, and I think a case has yet to be made that State grants should be made available for this work.  I do not think that case can be made until you have the county medical officer machinery to make it.  I do not think it can be given effect to until you have the medical officer of health in the various counties to assist in saying where, and in what order, the different works that are necessary should be taken up. 
     In connection with the matter of sanitation, questions were raised as to certain insanitary schools.  Schools are open to sanitary inspection in the normal course.  When it comes to the notice of those responsible for drawing attention to these matters and securing an abatement of the conditions, it has been the practice in the case of schools to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Education.  If the Department of Education is unable to have the insanitary conditions abated, then the schools are not exempt from the ordinary law in connection with the matter. 
     
      
       Before the Minister passes from the question of insanitary schools, might I ask him a question about barracks?  I would like to know how the local sanitary authority is affected in that connection.  I have a particular case in mind that occurred in Wexford where they would not permit our sanitary sub-officer to visit the barrack at all. 
     
     
      
       Barracks, and what is technically known as Crown property, are exempt from the provisions of the Act. 
     
     
      
       I think that is ridiculous.  I hope the Minister will seek powers for local authorities in that connection. 
     
     
      
       I hope the position is understood with regard to schools.  Exception was taken to the fact that I made no reference to the Report of the Poor Law Commission.   The recommendations contained in that report, and the position disclosed in it, have been receiving very close attention from the Department.  In quite a number of cases the attention of local bodies generally, and of particular local bodies, has been drawn to the conditions disclosed in the report.  The general recommendations made in the report can only be given effect to gradually in co-operation with the different authorities.  Different circumstances obtain in nearly every area, but the whole position is being dealt with.  At the present moment the cost of works in hand contemplated in respect to institutions throughout the country would be about £360,000. There are in all about 22 counties involved in these works.  That represents, to some extent at any rate, the active carrying out of the recommendations made.  I expect to have one of our inspectors, who has had considerable experience of the different classes of work through the country, available in June or July to give his whole time and attention to the various problems that are involved in this report. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister see that he will take into his consideration many points that obviously the Commission could have made a recommendation on but did not? 
     
     
      
       I hope, with the machinery of the Department and with the assistance that we can get from Deputies closely in touch with local government work in the country, that nothing of very great moment will be left without getting proper attention. Criticism was made of the Department's policy in restricting the number of beds available in district hospitals.  The reason for that restriction is that district hospitals be kept as district hospitals and that they should not develop into a kind of small district home.  It is desirable that the district hospital would be restricted to the hospital work it is intended for. Criticism has also been directed against amalgamation, and the idea of a single home in a county.  The present laws give ample facility for the granting of home assistance.  If people desire to retain their aged and infirm in their   homes, there is nothing to prevent them getting the necessary home assistance, but if it is necessary to put them into an institution then I am convinced at any rate that a proper county home is the place for them.  Criticism has been directed to the nature of the county homes.  Undoubtedly there are classes associated together in county homes that it is undesirable and not right should be together.  That is a matter involving the creation of separate institutions and the expenditure of a good lot of money.  It will have to be very carefully and very thoroughly investigated and dealt with, I might say, county by county, before we can reach the position that we want to reach. 
     
     Deputy French has spoken with very great approval of what it has been possible to achieve in Cork.  I must say that I was delighted with what I saw in the Cork County Home.  I have seen other county homes with which I cannot say I was delighted, but I realise the difficulties that lie in the way of Boards of Public Health in making their institutions what they would like them to be for the aged, and also segregating the different classes.  All that matter was brought to the front and dealt with in the Report of the Poor Law Commission, and it is receiving thorough and close attention from the Department.  Complaint is made that the regulations of the Department prevent surgical cases of a kind requiring special treatment in Dublin from being brought to Dublin.  The regulations do not, but we cannot have a general situation in which any dispensary doctor coming up against a surgical case can send it straight off to Dublin. The county hospitals to-day are intended to be very different from the workhouse hospitals in the old days. We have a county surgeon in each of the county hospitals, and I think no case ought to be sent to a city hospital by a dispensary doctor without consultation with the county surgeon responsible for the county work.  There are such things as telephones and telegrams, and there is nothing to prevent a case being sent to Dublin by a county board of health, and if that is inconvenient, by permission of the county surgeon.  I do not know why Deputies   or members of local bodies, or any dispensary doctor in the country, should be under a misconception with regard to it.  There is nothing in the mind of the Department, and nothing in the regulations of the Department, that would deny any poor person the particular class of medical aid he requires. 
     
      
       Is it not necessary for a form to be filled in by the local authority and sent direct to the Ministry before sanction is given or a patient can be sent away? 
     
     
      
       No.  I think the Deputy should consult Deputy Everett, who apparently understands the situation very well and has full practical knowledge of the position.  It is important there should be no misconception on this point.  A question was raised by Deputy Sir James Craig with regard to blind pensions claims.  In December, 1922, there were 1,600 blind pension cases awaiting inspection.  In May, 1926, there were only 200, and in May, 1928, there were 153 blind pension cases outstanding, 100 awaiting inspection, and 53 waiting examination of their files by the medical inspector. With the additional temporary medical assistance which we hope to get immediately, these numbers will be wiped out, but in view of the fact that we have now 11 county hospitals, in which we have an ophthalmic surgeon, the question is being considered as to whether the ophthalmic surgeon in a county hospital could not deal with a lot of this particular class of work. 
       On the matter of housing, I think the situation must be very clear from the consideration and review of the position that was given by the committee on unemployment recently, and the remarks it was able to make, and went out of its way to make, in praise of the efforts of the Government on the question of housing.  I think these remarks, and the facts that are known to Deputies, are an answer to anyone who would say the Government had either neglected the housing question or had failed in any particular way.  As to the Dublin slums, we know the position in regard to them. 
     
     
     
      
       Would the Minister say if the unemployment committee is considering the question of housing labourers in rural areas?  I understand it is only considering the housing question in relation to urban areas. 
     
     
      
       As far as the unemployment committee has reported, it considered the urban aspect of housing as the kernel of the housing question, but I am certain it did not leave out of consideration any problem there might be with regard to rural housing, and in our review of the problem we will not leave it out of consideration. The committee that exists at present is considering building costs and how they can be reduced.  That is a question which may have its kernel in the urban centres.  If there is a substantial reduction in building costs, that will enable a national programme facing building for a certain number of years to be gone ahead with, and that is going to have its reaction on the cost of housing in rural areas and in the number of rural houses it would be possible to provide. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister realise that in the cities and towns in Ireland there is a standard rate of wages?  Whether we like it or not it is a standard rate, and would the Government once and for all give a statement as to whether they are prepared to build houses for the working class upon the standard that exists rather than be suggesting that the standard should be reduced? 
     
     
      
       I do not know whether the Deputy refers to wages as a factor in building costs, or as a factor in the amount of rent at which the houses could be let. 
     
     
      
       I understand it was a definite excuse made at the Committee of Inquiry that the wages of the working men were too high to build houses and let them at an economic rent. 
     
     
      
       That is not the case. 
     
     
      
       I have nothing to say on that particular matter.  There is a committee going into the question,   and with the best of good will and with the fullest appreciation of the problem of housing, I think so far as it is concerned it can be left to deal with the matter without any outside influences being brought to bear.  Very little can be usefully said about housing. The best thing we can do is to leave the present committee to get down to its work, and close to it, without any disturbing influences or outside discussion at the moment.  I think Deputy Corish said that a 40 years' loan would solve the housing problem, and make houses built by local authorities economic. We have to consider in this particular matter the cost of building the houses and the rent a person is able to pay. Assuming that the Wexford Corporation got a loan at 51⁄2 per cent. for 40 years, and assume that they built houses on the reduced standard&mdash;a four-roomed house&mdash;and assume that £300 is the all-in building cost of that house, that is bringing it down to an economic rent, per £100 at 51⁄2 per cent. for 40 years of 2/11&mdash;the economic rent being the rent that will pay the interest and sinking fund on the loan and provide 1/6 per £100 for insurance, £1 per £100 for repairs, and to which you add 5 per cent. for collection costs and general administrative expenditure, and that economic rent per £100 is 2/11, and for a reduced four-roomed house which cost £300 the rent is 8/9 a week. 
     
     
      
       Of course I calculated on a subsidy coming from the Government. 
     
     
      
       Let us let this house at 6/- per week.  It amounts to this, that you would require a Government grant of £94 towards this house to enable you to let it at 6/- per week, and call it an economic proposition, leaving the Government subsidy out of your mind.  If you let it at 5/- a week it means the Government will have to give a grant of £128.  The problem that is before us is.  &ldquo;Can we solve the housing problem by giving £94 per house of this particular type in order to be able to let it at 6/- a week?&rdquo; That is the question we are face to face with, and personally I do not think you can regard it as going near the solution   of our housing difficulty, if you bear our financial difficulties in mind.  It is a matter of money.  We have a definite financial problem in this matter, and we must bring the cost of housing in relation to the rents that people are able to pay so close together that whatever, if any, subsidy is to be given it will not be of such a size that we cannot, as a State, pay it. 
     
     
      
       I was calculating on the present basis of the subsidy. 
     
     
      
       It would be worth while to consider whether the present subsidy can be given, and whether that can be regarded as an economic proposition.  Some people want more labourers' cottages.  At present a labourers' cottage, which in the old days cost £180 all in, costs from £300 to £360. 
     
     
      
       I think in some cases they can be built much cheaper.  I have seen specifications from £230. 
     
     
      
       It is the average price the Minister has given. 
     
     
      
       That is the information I have, and at present there are local bodies authorised to build labourers' cottages to the extent of 2,800.  That is, the plans have already been prepared and authority given under the Labourers Act for the erection of 2,800 cottages.  These plans are held up because of the price of building, but if you take £300 as the cost of a labourer's cottage and plot, without considering any fresh need, the cost of building the cottages would be £840. 
     
     
      
       I should like to know is the Minister quoting these building costs from figures supplied by the Builders' and Employers' Federation? Does he realise that there is some difference as between the cost of building given by those people and that given by rural contractors? 
     
     
      
       I am quoting figures supplied by my Department, which is in close touch with building costs at present.  When you speak of a labourer's cottage you speak of the   acre or half acre that goes with it, and the fencing necessary to go up all round it, so the cost of providing a labourer's cottage and plot could very easily be higher than the cost of providing that particular type of house which is one of a group of buildings in an urban district. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister see that it is the same engineer as was sent down to inspect the new Civic Guard buildings and estimated the cost at £1,550? 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister referring to a detached or semi-detached house, because if you take into consideration houses to be put up in blocks of ten or twelve, the cost would be much cheaper? 
     
     
      
       I am quoting the average cost.  However, that is a problem the whole of which is really in abeyance until we can see the facts as they will be before us in a few weeks if we are prepared to go ahead with a big housing scheme. 
     
     
      
       Is housing going to stop then? 
     
     
      
       It is practically stopped unless something is going to be done. 
     
     
      
       That is definite; we know now. 
     
     
      
       Then we are to understand that the Government themselves are not prepared to take any responsibility with regard to the housing scheme, that they are casting it on to a committee and will rely on its work. 
     
     
      
       The Government is not prepared to carry every baby in the country; others should carry their own babies. 
     
     
      
       The fact, as far as this Estimate is concerned, is that the money allotted for housing has been allocated practically in full.  There is £300 unallotted; that was unallotted when I was last speaking.  It may be allotted by now.  As far as this Estimate is concerned, there is no more money under my control to allot. 
     
     
     
      
       I wish to know whether the employers and the operatives in the Dublin area will be the parties to determine the policy of the Government in regard to the building of houses.  It does not follow that if they fail to agree in the county and city of Dublin that they will not agree in other parts. 
     
     
      
       The conference sitting at present is doing its own business in its own way. 
     
     
      
       For the Government? 
     
     
      
       For the parties to that conference. 
     
     
      
       For the Government? 
     
     
      
       They are doing it for the country as a whole.  If Deputies are suggesting that any decisions they come to are not likely to affect the country as a whole they are suggesting things they know are not facts.  The authorities who have come together in this conference are certain definite parties.  Deputies know where they come from as well as I do.  They are considering the whole question of building costs in the country. 
     
     
      
       It is about time it was considered. 
     
     
      
       I would say, in reply to Deputies in this debate who suggested that if something like this was done five years ago things would have been different, that it was not the fault of the President that this conference was not carrying out its discussions three or four years ago. 
     
     
      
       Whose fault was it? 
     
     
      
       Both parties. 
     
     
      
       It will not do any good to have this discussed.  Let us get away from it. 
     
     
      
       I believe it will not.  I did not start the discussion.  In reply to Deputy Coburn, who suggested some of the material put up in County Louth&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Not in County Louth. I did not mention County Louth. 
     
     
     
      
       Well, somewhere. If we have not information it is not worth talking about.  Two officers appointed by this Department have carried out their work satisfactorily, and I can only set off against the Deputy's statement, as we do not know whether he referred to any particular area&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I might say to the Minister that my statements were definite.  The materials I have seen put into the concrete walls consisted of 60 per cent. of loam and about 40 per cent. of, what I might call, loamy sand and gravel.  I know, as far as the treatment of concrete houses is concerned, that they require careful treatment in order that they may be sanitary and that we may not have cold, damp, sweating houses. 
     
     
      
       Is the Deputy going to make another speech? 
     
     
      
       I am only putting the matter before the Minister.  I say that they are not materials that should be allowed to be put into any house, no matter what inspectors saw them. 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy wanted to assist in the matter he should have drawn attention to it at the time it came under his notice.  It is of assistance neither to the Department nor to the people who will live in these houses to bring the matter into a discussion on the Estimates. 
     
     
      
       This is the first time I got an opportunity of drawing attention to it. 
     
     
      
       There is plenty of pens, paper and ink in the country. It is suggested that there is a mystery in regard to road finance.  The accounts of the Road Fund are duly audited and deposited before the House in the Library.  The accounts for the year ended March, 1927, were duly deposited there a short time ago, and if any information is required from March, 1927, up to date it can be easily obtained by question.  The general position with regard to the Road Fund is that from 1st April, 1922, up to March, 1928, the income to the Road Fund was   £4,487,717, and the allocations made during that time amounted to £5,809,503, the excess of allocations over income being £1,321,786.  Of this the amount received in the sixpenny rate was £1,247,653.  That is the position with regard to the Road Fund finances, and I do not know what mystery could be about it.  With regard to the future, the position we are in is that there will probably after another year or two not be more than £500,000 annually available for the improvement and maintenance of roads.  The tendency to say that our Road Fund, because of that, is bankrupt and that we are not going to be able to maintain the roads of the country is a tendency to get away from actual concrete things and to discuss the matter in theory.  With the exception of the Arklow road, to which Deputy Everett referred, there has been no criticism of roads in the country in this debate, and no Deputy has told us that the roads dealt with by the National Road Scheme of 1,167 miles are not good.  No one has told us that the trunk or main roads in the country are not good.  It has been suggested simply in a general way that the local roads are not being maintained in a good condition and in the way in which they were maintained before we had the Road Fund. 
     
     
      
       I think there was a quotation from one of the engineers who took part in the National Road Scheme that the roads improved under that scheme would not last any length of time.  It was forecasted that they would not last.  I think that was an actual quotation from his speech. 
     
     
      
       I do not know what the Deputy means by saying the roads would not last.  I do not place the Deputy's interpretation on the report he speaks of but I do say that no one has attempted to deal with the concrete situation, to take the road situation and criticise it.  We are not able to say to-day to what extent buses are doing damage to the roads.  A kind of mentality, as far as I can see, seems to have developed with regard to buses&mdash; that is, a type of outlook which is rather psychological.  We are so near the days when the Black and Tans   careered around the country developing antagonistic feelings in us to them, that the buses leave the same kind of impression on our minds when they sweep past us, and we are inclined to re-act towards them in the same way as we re-acted towards a lorry of Black and Tans. 
     
     
      
       Or a lorry of Green and Tans. 
     
     
      
       I do not think that is the general feeling. 
     
     
      
       If Deputies would help us in the matter of sizing up what damage is being done to the roads by buses we would be very glad of their assistance.  We have very considerably improved the roads, and we have no reason to fear that they will not last a reasonable time and that a reasonable amount spent on maintenance will not keep them in good condition.  We have laid down a certain class of surface.  We have to a certain extent learned by experience what the result of increasing modern traffic is going to be on those surfaces. There is no use in setting up a bogey and getting frightened about it without any reason in the world.  We have no reason to think that our roads are going rapidly and in a terrible manner to deteriorate.  We have no reason to think that the finances available for the improvement and proper maintenance of the roads are not going to be there.  One matter that might be mentioned in connection with the maintenance of roads is that we pay the road authorities 50 per cent. of the upkeep of the main and trunk roads and 30 per cent. of the upkeep of the link roads.  The object of doing so was that we might reduce for the road authorities the cost of road maintenance, which in recent years has risen very much above pre-war figures. We have laid it down as a standard that we expect road authorities to expend on the maintenance of their roads approximately 50 per cent. above the 1914 expenditure.  The expenditure from the Estimate for roads generally for the current year is going to be 44 per cent. above the expenditure in 1913-14.  Certain road authorities show   a tendency to reduce their expenditure on maintenance.  If that tendency is continued we shall have to take steps to keep from them some of the grants they are getting, because we cannot allow road authorities charged with the proper maintenance of their roads to save their own ratepayers by attempting to throw a burden unjustly, as compared with other counties, on to the Road Fund. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister state from what funds he makes these grants to local bodies for the upkeep and maintenance of roads? 
     
     
      
       The grant for the upkeep and improvement of roads is made from the Road Fund. 
     
     
      
       What is that fund collected from? 
     
     
      
       That fund comes from motor taxation, and up to March, 1928, it received the sixpenny tax as well. 
     
     
      
       In connection with the upkeep of roads, the Minister mentioned that the Department contributes 50 per cent. of the excess cost over 1914. 
     
     
      
       Oh, no. 
     
     
      
       That was what I understood him to say. 
     
     
      
       No.  We expect that local authorities will spend out of the rates on general road maintenance approximately fifty per cent. over what they spent in 1913-14.  The contributions that we make from the Road Fund to road authorities towards maintenance is fifty per cent. of their total expenditure on trunk roads, and thirty per cent. of their total expenditure on link roads. 
     
     
      
       I only want to remind the Minister that the statement was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House during this month that the excess of the upkeep of roads over 1913-14 was borne out of the Road Fund. 
     
     
      
       Oh, no. 
     
     
     
      
       I will get the statement for the Minister. 
     
     
      
       I think I was listening to the Minister making the statement.  The Deputy must be under some misapprehension. 
     
     
      
       I made a note of it at the time as being interesting. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that the difference between the thirty per cent. and the fifty per cent. is the principal reason for the depreciation of the link roads; that the county councils are naturally anxious to spend all the money on trunk roads? 
     
     
      
       You cut it down yourself. 
     
     
      
       At any rate the position is, as I say, that the road authorities are expected to contribute from the rates to the maintenance of the roads generally approximately fifty per cent. over what they contributed in 1913-14.  Exception has been taken to the allocation of the improvement grants.  In the distribution of the improvement grants from the Road Fund it was necessary to deal equitably with all road authorities, and a formula had to be found that would enable us to allocate the money in an equitable way.  The improvement grant distributed this year is based on a formula which takes into consideration the expenditure by the road authorities in the year 1926-27, the population in the year 1926, the date of the last census; the valuation of the area in 1927, the total mileage of trunk and link roads, and the total amount of money collected for the Road Fund from 1922 to 1927.  Each of these factors is taken into consideration, and it is the most satisfactory association of factors that could be arrived at, so that every aspect of the work in the country would be properly allowed for.  If any Deputy considers that his particular county, or any particular county, is being wronged in the matter of the allocation of the Road Fund for improvement he will have to find a better formula.  The matter cannot be dealt with simply as one affecting individual counties.  Deputy Maguire   seemed to take exception to what he considers was a fact&mdash;that is, that money was collected in Leitrim under the sixpenny tax and spent in Dublin. The total amount collected in County Leitrim in respect of motor taxes from 1922 to 1927 was £16,272, and in respect of the sixpenny rate about £14,000, or a total of £30,272.  The total amount of grants made to Leitrim in that period was £68,407.  That means that there was paid to Leitrim from the Road Fund £38,000 more than was collected in Leitrim. 
     
     
      
       Does the Minister separate the sixpenny rate from the ordinary motor taxes? 
     
     
      
       I said that the motor tax collected amounted to £16,272 and £14,000 from the sixpenny rate; that the total was £30,272, and that approximately £38,000 in addition was spent in Leitrim out of the Road Fund. 
     
     
      
       Comparing the amount collected under the sixpenny rate in Leitrim with the amount collected in other counties, I claim that Leitrim has not got a proportionate grant. 
     
     
      
       Of course the Deputy will claim all kinds of things. When Deputy Hogan compares County Clare with County Louth, he compares it, I take it, from the point of view of the amount of money expended under the national scheme.  From the point of view of the scheme of national roads, County Louth is in a very different position from County Clare.  County Louth has two very important ports and is the corridor, or part of the corridor, from Dublin to Belfast, and, of necessity, there will be a difference in the number of miles of national roads running through Louth as against the number that will run through Clare. We simply cannot run a national system of roads on the basis of cutting out a certain number of miles for each particular county. 
     
     
      
       I could have quoted counties that have no corridors to any particular place that were better treated than County Clare. 
     
     
      
       I expect I could have as equally good an answer. 
     
     
     
      
       I dare say you could. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Ward had some criticism with regard to Louth, Monaghan and Meath.  The position with regard to Louth, Monaghan and Meath is that different classes of work were carried out on the roads in these counties.  There is also the fact that traffic conditions in Monaghan differ from traffic conditions in Louth and Meath.  A traffic census was carried out a couple of years ago at different points, and the following was the average per ton per day in each county:&mdash;County Louth, 680 tons; County Meath, 619 tons; County Monaghan, 327 tons.  You cannot, as I said with regard to Clare and Louth, be allowed to reduce your national scheme, or even the cost of any particular mile of road, to a standard number of miles per county with a standard cost per mile in each particular county. The question was raised by Deputy Moore as to the extent to which we could bear the cost of concrete roads. The amount of concrete roads put down is very small, and, where it has been put down, it has been put down mainly in bog areas.  The Naas road to the Kildare border is laid down over a stretch of bog.  Money has been put year after year into that bog up to the present. The concrete road that has been made in Wexford has been made under somewhat similar conditions.  But so far as I can see at the moment, with the system under which we are financing our roads, we cannot afford&mdash;and it may not be either desirable or necessary&mdash; to have a more extended system of concrete roads. 
     
     Generally, there has been a tendency to charge the Department, in its administration and in the legislation that it has brought about, with centralising influences and with an endeavour to make small boys out of the people who are giving their services to local government on public boards.  The particular matters to which exception is taken is the Departmental attitude with regard to the making of appointments, and the Departmental attitude with regard to the Combined Purchasing Act. In the matter of appointments, Deputy Brennan objects to the interpretation placed by the Department on a particular   clause in the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act.  I can only place on the Act the interpretation that I am advised to place on it. The matter has already been discussed in the House, and since then I have discussed it with deputations from the General Council of County Councils and from the Local Government Employees' Association.  There is only one way in which the question can be solved, and that is by an appeal, either on the part of a local body aggrieved or on the part of a person aggrieved, to the courts.  I have felt the desirability, from the Department's point of view, on more than one occasion of being able to refer a question to the courts and get a decision, without having two parties brandishing clubs against one another in the matter.  I see that there are others who have felt the desirability of that.  In connection with the recent Rating and Valuation Act in England there was, apparently, a proposal in it to refer certain matters to the High Court, but the High Court took up the attitude that they were not going to be solicitors to any Government Department, and I think it is quite reasonable that if a decision is to be got on any particular matter the decision should be sought in the courts.  But in the meantime I want to say that the way in which we interpret Clause 5 (1) of the Act brings us into touch with local bodies immediately a vacancy occurs. The matter can be discussed between the Department and the local body, and the most suitable arrangement for the local body can be come to.  There is a tendency to approach these matters from the point of view that of necessity the Department will always be antagonistic to the wishes of the local body.  A vacancy that occurs at present and that a local body wish to fill by promotion, arises for discussion between the local body and the Department as a vacancy, according to our regulations and instructions.  To deal with them as Deputy Brennan suggests would mean that a discussion would arise around the name of some professional person, and it is much more desirable, I suggest&mdash;and I think the matter is appreciated from that point of view by the employees of local bodies  &mdash;that when a dispute does arise it should arise rather with regard to procedure than that it should arise around the professional fitness, or otherwise, or the general suitability or otherwise of a particular person for a position. 
     Deputy Corry raised a particular case, and I undertook to answer him. It was where, on the 28th March, 1927, a vacancy occurred for a rate collector in Cork.  On the 12th August the council had notified to them the result of a competitive examination which they had got set up.  On the 2nd September they approved of the appointment of the first person, and subsequently, in January, it transpired that the person appointed had not been carrying out the collection of the rates, that he had in the meantime got a university scholarship of some kind, and that he had delegated the work of collecting the rates to his brother.  The Council secured the resignation of the person who was appointed but who did not collect the rates, and they, knowing the full facts of the case, appointed the brother, who had taken fourth place in the examination, as a temporary collector to complete the collection of the rates that he had already been engaged in carrying out.  But the Department did not enter into the matter, good, bad or indifferent, except in this, that they insisted that the brother should be appointed only in a temporary capacity, and that the vacancy should be re-advertised when the time for appointing a man to collect this year's rates came around. 
     I see nothing to blame the Department for in that matter.  As far as competitive or qualifying examinations are held and where the person who takes first place can satisfy the Council as to his character and his general health, the attitude of the Department is that the first person home in the examination should be appointed.  The Department's difficulty, when they set up examinations, is to get local bodies to appoint the first person.  The Department, up to some time ago, assisted local bodies by holding qualifying examinations for them, but when they did so the difficulty of getting the local body to appoint the first person was   such that the Department, rather than have the name of being associated with examinations where the first person was not appointed, gave up the system of holding qualifying examinations for local authorities.  If a local authority wants an examination now they have to arrange with some outside person to carry it out. 
     
      
       I wish to point out that the examination in this case was not a qualifying examination, but was a competitive examination.  There was the camouflage of this individual who came down from Dublin to sit for this examination who had no intention of filling the post, and who only got sanction for the purpose of having it for his brother, whom he knew under no circumstances would come first in the examination.  There are two hungry young men who passed this examination. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy has a complaint against the Cork County Council.  It has nothing to do with the Minister for Local Government, and it has nothing to do with this Estimate. 
     
     
      
       The Minister sanctioned it. 
     
     
      
       The Minister agreed with the Cork County Council in keeping this man on as a temporary rate collector, and insisted that the position for a permanent rate collector should be re-advertised when the current year's rate came to be collected. 
     
     
      
       The Minister's action in that matter shows that the Minister was a party to&mdash;I do not like to call it corruption&mdash;but in any event he was a party to a matter which is a scandal, namely, depriving a young boy of a position, by a trick, and a dirty trick. 
     
     
      
       I think it would be better if the Deputy explained that matter to the Cork County Council and not here. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy will not be allowed to explain it here. 
     
     
      
       I would like you to rule the matter out of order if   we are not to have it cropping up at all times.  Deputy Maguire, in the same way, objects to the Department's attitude with regard to appointments. The Leitrim County Council, having advertised for a typist, had specified shorthand as one of the subjects, and having reviewed the qualifications of five candidates appointed a person who was not qualified.  The fact came before the Department and the Department required that the qualifications that had been before the Leitrim County Council be sent for Departmental review.  The Department considered that the circumstances were such that the person selected by the Leitrim County Council should not be appointed, that the vacancy should be re-advertised, and that the Secretary of the County Council ought to be called into consultation in reviewing the qualifications of the girl who was to be appointed as typist. 
     
     
      
       I made no reference to the case the Minister has referred to at all. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Maguire wants the Leitrim County Council and other local bodies to be allowed, as he calls it, to appoint their own officials in their own way.  It is the Department's attitude in the matter that these officers who come within the scope of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act will be appointed in accordance with the spirit and the terms of that Act, and where other officers are appointed, and where they have any responsibility for these appointments, they see that the local bodies act in such a way that the Department can be satisfied that they are building up efficient staffs. 
     
     
      
       resumed the Chair. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister tell us what happened on Wednesday last at the County Council meeting about the same officer? 
     
     
      
       I have not seen the minutes of the last County Council meeting.  The Department has been charged with a tendency to centralise things too much.  The attitude of the Department is to place on local bodies the full responsibilities that may from   time to time be placed upon them; to see that, in so far as they are building up a machinery around them, either to advise them in their duties or to carry out their work for them, that that machinery is going to be effective.  We are going to have local government work neglected in the country if local bodies are allowed to surround themselves with machinery that is inefficient, that cannot do the work of preparation that is necessary to advise local bodies with regard to their work, and, when the local bodies have taken decisions, that cannot effectively carry out the wishes of the local bodies. 
     
     
      
       In order to put that into effect, will the Minister reconsider the question of the Cork appointment that I have referred to? 
     
     
      
       In so far as any aspect of the matter comes to us from time to time, we will give the fullest possible consideration to it, but the more inefficient the machinery local bodies have under them the less can we rely on them to carry out the duties that are there, and the less can we hope to put on to local bodies greater or increased responsibility, should it appear desirable to do so.  It is in the interests of local government, and it is for the purpose of being able to transfer such responsibility as from time to time it does seem might well be transferred to local bodies, that we are so anxious at present to see that the machinery the local bodies have under them is a good and a sound machinery. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister throw any light on the case I cited the other day, the case of where the Mental Hospital of Sligo had an application from a candidate for a post there?  The Local Appointments Commissioners, in sending out their advertisements, notified the applicants to the extent of five days' notice.  I mentioned one case in which there was a rural postal delivery only three days in the week, and the applicant did not receive his notice in time to allow of his attendance at the examination. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy, I hope, understands that I have nothing to do with the work of the Local   Appointments Commissioners, and if somebody does not post a letter in time, or a small accident happens of any kind, I hope that the Deputy will avoid reading into that that the policy of the Department of Local Government is all wrong and should be changed. 
     
     
      
       I do not suggest that, but I feel that if the Minister is to defend appointments by the Local Appointments Commissioners as against the old system of appointments by local bodies, then where a mistake like that occurs it should be sufficient to warrant the Appointments Commissioners to make redress and give the applicant an opportunity to attend the examination. 
     
     
      
       Was it brought to their notice? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       Did they refuse to consider his application? 
     
     
      
       The Minister is not responsible for the Local Appointments Commissioners, and the matter will arise on another Estimate. 
     
     
      
       In his anxiety for efficiency, how can the Minister account for the appointment of one man to do five jobs and giving him a salary of £2,800? 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister mind answering one little point? 
     
     
      
       I understood Deputy Corry had concluded the debate.  I heard him make the one statement seven times. 
     
     
      
       The Minister has not yet explained the matter. 
     
     
      
       Has the Minister concluded yet? 
     
     
      
       I have not. 
     
     
      
       I thought the Minister had abandoned the matter in despair. 
     
     
      
       I am prepared to abandon it in despair if I am not allowed to say what I want to say in reply to the criticisms that have been made. 
     
     
     
      
       Shall we take Deputy Moore's question first? 
     
     
      
       I can wait until the end. 
     
     
      
       The position as far as this House is concerned is that there was contributed in the year ended March, 1926, to the local bodies for spending, £3,042,622 from the Central Government and the rates contributed the sum of £6,736,129.  And apart from the responsibility that is thrown on the Executive Council and exercised through the Local Government Department to see that the public welfare is secured in the work of local government, there is also the fact that upwards of £3,000,000 of State money is being spent annually by these bodies and it is a vital concern to the Oireachtas and to the Executive Council that we should be assured that the local bodies have, for carrying out their work, machinery that is efficient and effective. 
     
     Complaints have been directed against the operations of the Combined Purchasing Act.  The Combined Purchasing Act is law, and Deputies who may feel themselves influenced by criticisms of that Act would do well to read the Act, and to read the regulations issued in 1926 with regard to its operations. The various articles that are used by the local bodies have been discussed by the representatives on the local bodies and standard articles have been selected. If the articles supplied are not up to the standard, and if they are the shoddy that the Deputies speak of, there are definite regulations for dealing with the matter.  Complaints that come up to the Department are dealt with in a thorough and systematic way. Deputy Ward yesterday referred to the case of certain tar shortage in Monaghan in which he charged the Department, I believe, with being almost responsible for the shortage in the tar supplies to Monaghan from a particular firm and that when the shortage was brought to the notice of the Department very little concern was shown by them in the matter.  Now, Deputy Ward's facts are wrong.  The initiative of finding this shortage in Monaghan was taken by the Trade Department.   In July, 1927, the county surveyors and the surveyors in urban districts had issued to them by the Trade Department a warning that serious shortages had been found in some instances between the quantity of tar and compounds invoiced and that actually received, and the Trade Department warned all concerned that they should have arrangements made for the correct checking of the quantities actually supplied as against the quantities invoiced. From the County Surveyor's office in Monaghan in August, 1927, a reply came acknowledging the receipt of this letter and saying &ldquo;Up to the present, no case of complaint has arisen in this county and I am satisfied that the tar, etc., invoiced has been delivered.&rdquo;  The trade inspector visiting the area on the 14th November, 1927, reported:&mdash;&ldquo;I visited to-day the County Surveyor, Mr. Hannigan, who has had complaints from his staff that the tar being supplied by Messrs. &mdash;&mdash; was short in quantity in the barrels.  He asked me to go with him and have some of the barrels measured.  We had two measured at two different localities.  The barrels are supposed to hold 40 gallons but the barrels measured only contained 35.  He is taking up the matter with the firm.&rdquo; Now, the Combined Purchasing Department is effectively and thoroughly doing this work&mdash;&mdash; 
     
      
       Is the Minister finished on that particular point? 
     
     
      
       I am. 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister say if his Department was prepared to accept 6,000 gallons from this firm, and if the county surveyor of the Monaghan County Council refused to accept that amount, and that eventually the firm had to put up 18,000 gallons? 
     
     
      
       I can certainly deny that the Department were prepared to accept any particular specified number of gallons from the firm, but these remarks naturally influence Deputies and influence people in the country not to appreciate the combined purchasing arrangement as much as they might.  I want to suggest to persons with any kind of common sense that where you have a large   number of public bodies that are expending a very large amount of money on supplies that very great economies can and must, if possible, be brought about.  Very considerable support has been given to Irish manufacturers through the combined purchasing scheme.  It would weary Deputies if I were to read out to them a list of 36 or 37 items alone of Irish manufacture that are exclusively included on the combined purchasing list. 
       With regard to the annual cost of this Department, I observe that some Deputies complain that they cannot get the figures as to the cost of it.  The cost of the Combined Purchasing Department amounts to £4,115, and on tars alone, by a proper co-ordination of the orders during the past year, which amounted to approximately £113,000, I have been able to save £11,000 as against last year's prices. There has been a reduction of ten per cent. on orders of £113,000. 
     
     
      
       Was that due to the fall in the market? 
     
     
      
       That was due to the proper co-ordination of orders, and I expect to bring about in the purchase of tars and bitumens next year a very much greater reduction.  The work of co-ordinating the different authorities in this matter was begun rather late last year, and it took a much longer time to co-ordinate their orders than we expected it would have taken, and the orders for tars and bitumens were placed on the market rather late this year.  Placing them earlier, as we hope to do towards the end of this year for next year's purchasing, we hope to get very much reduced prices. 
     
     
      
       I am not antagonistic to the work of the Central Purchasing Board at all, but I think the Minister should tell us, in relation to the figures in connection with tar, whether there has been any fall in the market prices this year as compared with last year. 
     
     
      
       I could not say to what extent there has been a fall, but I would suggest that practically the whole of this reduction is due to the   way in which we were able to place the orders through the Combined Purchasing Department this year.  The amount of good that the Combined Purchasing Department could do is not fully achieved even now, because people take up an antagonistic attitude towards it. They want orders and supplies for local institutions given to local traders, and in many places where we might have expected more intelligent co-operation, there has been very definite antagonism against the carrying out of this Act. 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister state if the price paid was the same this year as last year? 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       I understand that perhaps the reduction was due to co-ordination? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       Would the reduction be caused by the increased quantity or by better transport or the lower cost of the material itself? 
     
     
      
       It is because we impose restrictions on the local bodies to place their orders in a particular way; it was because we ascertained the amount of tar that might be delivered at particular ports around the county, and we were able to issue with the tenders a statement of the ports and a statement of the amounts of each particular class of liquid that would be taken at these ports.  There has been criticism of whiskey and criticism of soap.  In any of these matters, wherever it is brought to our notice that the goods supplied were not up to specification, the contract was withdrawn, and in fact for the current period the tender that was entered into with us for tallow crown soap has been withdrawn because the soap supplied was not up to the standard. 
     
     
      
       Has the Minister anything to say to justify the sending out of shovels, forks and spades made in England to institutions in this country?  Surely these are capable of being manufactured here? 
     
     
     
      
       &ldquo;Shamrock&rdquo; shovels. 
     
     
      
       I understand there was no quotation from any Irish firm for these for the current period, and I cannot undertake to make an Irish manufacturer quote for them. 
     
     
      
       Is an institution not at liberty to take the matter up with an Irish manufacturer? 
     
     
      
       The difficulty with institutions when buying on their own is to get them to buy Irish manufacture. They suit themselves to the wishes and to the stock of the local trader, rather than to any national policy or thing. 
     
     
      
       May I point out that these implements have to be put together in such a way that they could work?  As they were received, they were absolutely unfit for agricultural work. 
     
     
      
       Then they should have been returned.  If there are institutions that use implements or tools for which there is no provision made in the list, then they should arrange with the Department to put them on their list of standardised articles.  As another instance of the insidious attack on the prestige of the Department with local bodies and with the people generally, I want to reply to Deputy Maguire's statement with regard to some thousands of pounds of outstanding rates which he said, contrary to all reason, the Department wrote off in Leitrim.  The period concerned is the period 1920/21, and the sum concerned was £5,588, spread over four different collectors.  Either Deputy Maguire or Deputy Holt said that he knew one of these collectors who could collect £900 of these rates.  I do not know whether he was the collector who had £978 outstanding and who was dismissed for not carrying out his duties properly.  The circumstances in which these rates were written off are suggested in this report from the Commissioner made in 1926:&mdash; 
     
     The reasons for the non-collection of the rates mentioned are as follows: The disturbed state of the country in 1921-22; the fact that the rate collectors   of the county at that time were not required to fill or send in collectors' abstracts or to attend to have their books checked, and the fact that the books of these first-mentioned collectors were taken from them by force and destroyed. 
     The report goes on to describe the situation there, and says:&mdash; 
     In 1921-22 the County Council brought about 70 cases before the Arbitration Court in Mohill, and the cases were dismissed, as each defendant and his two or three witnesses swore that the rates in question had been paid.  No receipts were produced. After the appointment of the new collectors an effort was made to recover the amount outstanding. Some of those who had not paid were honest enough to come forward and admit their liability.  These amounts were collected.  But when it came to getting the unwilling ones to admit or meet their liabilities to the County Council there was no means of proving the claims, and the matter remains so still. 
     The Commissioner recommended that these amounts, arising as outstanding out of particular circumstances and in particular conditions, should be written off, and the Department acquiesced. The matter is brought up now in 1928 for the purpose of showing how loose the Department can be with ratepayers' money and interests.  The Department is not loose in any way with ratepayers' money or interests.  Personally I deprecate very much the attitude of Deputies who take advantage of their position in this House to make misleading suggestions of this kind. 
     
      
       There was no misleading suggestion of any kind.  It is there in the Auditor's report, that a sum of £4.259 9s. 8d. in one instance was cancelled by the Department on the recommendation of the Commissioner, and you afterwards gave that collector a pension. 
     
     
      
       Does the Deputy remember that at one time a certain rate collector in Leitrim who was brought in to prove these debts was raided and afterwards kicked to death? Who was responsible for that? 
     
     
     
      
       Let us get on. 
     
     
      
       Deputy French and others referred to certain matters towards the end of the debate. It has been suggested that Ballincollig barracks should be fitted out for housing at, perhaps, a small cost.  The matter was fully gone into before, and the cost was found to be prohibitive.  I understand the matter is again under consideration, but what can be done there and elsewhere will depend upon the extent to which building costs can be reduced. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister say something with reference to Windsor Avenue, to which I drew attention?  This matter has been going on for twelve months, and I should like to read an extract from a letter to the Minister. 
     
     
      
       What is the question? 
     
     
      
       A question was raised in the debate as to bus traffic passing through Windsor Avenue, Fairview. 
     
     
      
       Bus traffic passing through Windsor Avenue? 
     
     
      
       Yes.  I asked the Minister to deal with the matter on the Estimates, as I was quite entitled to do. 
     
     
      
       I wonder! 
     
     
      
       I am perfectly entitled to raise the question, and I should like to read an extract&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Let the Minister deal with the matter then.  I will not have any more extracts.  The Deputy must only ask a question and cannot proceed to enter into an argument. 
     
     
      
       The Minister had not concluded when I stood up, and I had waited for an hour to get a chance of intervening. 
     
     
      
       The Minister has now concluded, and the Deputy must only ask a question and not go into an argument.  The difficulty   is that the Minister has listened to 36 speakers for a period of over 7 hours. 
     
     
      
       We have spent 11 hours on this. 
     
     
      
       He has listened to 36 speakers, and when he is replying he is confronted with questions which are arguments.  What I want the Deputy to do is to ask a question. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister say if the bus traffic through Windsor Avenue is to be continued or discontinued in view of the facts I have laid before him and in view of the fact that serious damage is being done to the property of people living in that avenue who own their own houses? 
     
     
      
       The question of the continuance or discontinuance of the bus traffic there is a matter in which three bodies are involved&mdash;the Commissioners, the Garda Siochana, and, to a certain extent, the Department. There are differences of opinion amongst these three bodies with regard to it, but the matter is having a kind of continuous consideration from them. 
     
     
      
       It is over twelve months old now. 
     
     
      
       There is a matter that I intended to bring before the Minister, but I was engaged on a deputation to another Minister. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy must put it in the form of a question. 
     
     
      
       I will ask a question. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy must put it in the note of interrogation. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that certain works of public utility in County Dublin, particularly the water supply scheme for Clondalkin, is being held up owing to the fact that the question of Greater Dublin has not been settled? 
     
     
      
       How can the Minister be expected, without having   been given notice, to answer a question of the water supply at Clondalkin and whether it is being held up?  It is ludicrous to ask the Minister about a particular matter of this kind about which he has had no notice. 
     
     
      
       I think the Minister has had notice of this particular question, because some time ago&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I think the Deputy has answered himself by introducing the words &ldquo;Greater Dublin.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister state when the Bill dealing with Greater Dublin will be introduced? 
     
     
      
       The point is that a deputation was received here in this House. 
     
     
      
       I notice that the note of interrogation is gone. 
     
     
      
       I shall introduce it again.  Has not a deputation been received by Deputies in this House in reference to this particular scheme, and was it not proven that the area proposed to be supplied would not be included in the Greater Dublin area? Was it not also proven that the water supply scheme for Clondalkin was one of very great urgency, and that the conditions existing there at the present moment for want of a proper water supply are appalling?  Would the Minister expedite the consideration of the scheme, and give to the South Dublin Rural Council, who are the undertakers concerned, an undertaking&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Deputy Moore. 
     
     
      
       The Council have been refused. 
     
     
      
       I am going to hear Deputy Moore now. 
     
     
      
       When I referred yesterday to the possibility of the Traffic Committee reporting in favour of a change in motor taxation the Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, &ldquo;No, nor they would not have anything to do with it.&rdquo;  I have in mind what the Minister for Finance said when discussing the Budget resolution.  He said: &ldquo;We have   not made any proposals in this Budget with regard to the taxation which feeds the Road Fund, for this reason: We have been giving it consideration, and have had an inter-Departmental committee reviewing the whole matter, and the investigations are not complete.&rdquo;  I want to know from the Minister is that committee not a traffic committee, or is it a separate committee? 
     
     
      
       May I put in a note of interrogation by asking will the Minister for Local Government and Public Health discuss the question of the Clondalkin water supply raised by Deputy MacEntee with the Deputies representing Dublin at some convenient time? 
     
     
      
       Certainly. 
     
     
      
       May I ask a question which I have already given notice of seven times? 
     
     
      
       It has been asked already, and the Deputy cannot ask it again. 
     
     
      
       I want an answer. 
     
     
      
       That is a different thing. 
     
     
      
       Would the Minister please make some pronouncement on the point I raised yesterday? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       The Minister is now&mdash;I know it is an absurd phrase&mdash;about finally to conclude. 
     
     
      
       I have no intention of changing the regulation dealing with the matter that Deputy Jordan raised yesterday.  Deputy Moore is confusing the Inter-Departmental Committee on Road Traffic appointed on 27th April, 1927, with the discussions going on between different Departments through the medium of their own civil servants about Budget time. I think the Deputy must have heard somebody whispering that the Departments of Local Government and Industry and Commerce and Finance were discussing motor taxation, and that there was a discussion going on between an Inter-Departmental group   of officials about motors at Budget time.  The Deputy or somebody else must have heard that.  I suggest that two things are being confused.  The Inter-Departmental Committee on Road Traffic set up in April, 1927, is the only committee sitting at present dealing with the matter, and will not report on motor taxation. 
     
     
      
       Then the Minister for Finance was wrong in his statement. 
     
     
      
       I do not know about the Minister for Finance.  He can explain his own statement.  If I may do so, A Chinn Comhairle, I would like to put a question through you to Deputy Sir James Craig.  When he complains about there being too much inspection in connection with medical matters under the Local Government Department, will he at some time explain what he means?  He referred to statements of his made some years ago on the matter as an excuse for not going into details. 
     
     
      
       As a point of personal explanation, I mentioned in the discussion that the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the upkeep of the roads cost nothing more to-day than   in 1914, and the Minister for Local Government, I understand, contradicted that.  May I read from the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 16th May, 1928, only a few days ago?  He said:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;If the ratepayer has to pay more for the roads than he had to pay in 1914 he certainly has a right to complain. He is not being asked to pay anything now for the better type of roads capable of withstanding bus traffic. 
       Mr. DAVIN: Question. 
       Mr. McGILLIGAN: The Deputy may disagree with my figures, but that has been the policy.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       rose&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I shall put the question now.  Deputy Good has simply affirmed a statement he made before, and furnished proof of it, but that is not a personal explanation. 
     
     
      
       I am sorry. 
     
     
      
       Before you put the question&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       No; I must put the question now. 
       Question put.

     IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - VOTE 43&mdash;NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Go ndeontar suim na raghaidh thar £220,933 chun slanuithe na suime is ga chun ioctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith inioctha i rith na bliana dar crioch an 31adh la de Mharta, 1929, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisi an Choimisiuin Arachais agus chun Ilsintiuisi agus Ildeontaisi mar gheall ar chostas Sochar agus Costaisi Riarachain fe sna hAchtanna um Arachas Slainte Naisiunta, 1911 go 1927 (maraon le Deontaisi airithe i gCabhair). 
       That a sum not exceeding £220,933 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1929, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Insurance Commission and for sundry Contributions and Grants in respect of the cost of Benefits and Expenses of Administration under the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1927 (including certain Grants-in-Aid). 
     
     
      
       The only matter to which, perhaps, attention should be drawn in connection with this Vote is the decrease of £3,000 under F (2). This must not be read as indicating that less advantage is being taken of the National Health Insurance Act.  As a matter of fact, young people are   coming in under the Act to a much greater extent than formerly, and the old people who are in are keeping more regularly in contribution.  The reduction is the result entirely of the withdrawing of the Prolongation of Insurance Act from December last, under which 60,000 people from whom no contributions had been received for several years were kept in insurance, involving a State grant towards additional administration on the part of societies and grants towards sickness benefit in respect of which no contributions were received. 
     
     
      
       I have only a few remarks to offer, and I hope the Minister will take them in good part. What I propose to say I think I said before.  Perhaps that was what the Minister objected to in my remarks on the Local Government Estimate.  I called attention before to the fact that the cost of administration, so far as this Estimate is concerned, seems to me always to be out of all proportion to the amount of the benefits paid to those who are insured.  The sum of £123,800 is paid in administration and in medical certification.  The amount of benefits paid under the statutory contributions is £218,720.  Of course, this has nothing to do with what the societies' contribution is.  But it seems to me that that is a tremendous proportion of the amount paid to the societies for the benefit of the people who are insured, in comparison with the cost of administration. There is no information here as to the cost of administration of the insurance societies themselves or what proportion it bears to the amount of the benefits paid. 
     
     I think I spoke before about the additional benefits paid.  Amongst the additional benefits, hospital treatment is, in my opinion, extremely important.  Out of the 44 approved societies, I understand 19 societies have adopted the additional benefit of hospital treatment for the people insured with them.  One of the largest societies&mdash;the Ancient Order of Hibernians&mdash;has not yet adopted hospital treatment as an additional benefit, with the result that the hospitals have to treat the people who belong to this society for nothing.  There   are a certain number of societies who are extremely willing to pay this hospital benefit.  Among them are the Prudential Insurance Society, the Irish Amalgamated Insurance Society, the Liver National Health Society, the South Dublin Catholic Insurance Society and the Dublin Catholic Young Men's Association.  I am told that, so far as the hospitals are concerned, these five societies are particularly good in paying the amount that they decided upon&mdash; 25/- a week for treatment of the poor people who are insured with them.  I am quite sure that the Commissioners have endeavoured to get this additional benefit of hospital treatment adopted by the various societies.  I am told that the larger societies, like the Ancient Order of Hibernians, are giving money in other ways&mdash;that they are giving greater benefits than this would provide. Speaking from the point of view of the hospitals, I think it is hardly fair that these hospitals should have to treat for nothing the people who are insured in certain approved societies. 
     
      
       I think this is about the most unsatisfactory public service of all the public services we have been dealing with.  Some time ago, when a Vote was passing through this House under this heading, I raised the question of the difficulty of securing benefits for people who are ill and entitled to benefit. The Minister for Local Government, on that occasion, gave me to understand that it was merely a matter of bringing the irregularities under the notice of the National Health Insurance Commission and steps would be taken immediately to ensure that benefits would be paid to those people entitled to them.  At that time when we were discussing the question I emphasised the necessity for prompt payment of sickness benefits, and I want to touch on that side of the question again.  When people are ill and all sources of revenue are cut off it naturally is a tremendous handicap to them if they cannot secure sickness benefit under the National Health Insurance.  That is the time when they would require to be removed from mental anxiety concerning the provision of the necessaries of life for themselves and their dependants.  It is essential at that time that there should   be some source of revenue in order to procure the necessary forms of nourishment to insure a speedy recovery. 
       Another serious aspect of this difficulty in securing payment of benefit is that people have to return to work before they are physically fit, because the people dependent on them are in want and they cannot secure benefit.  The result is that these people become chronic invalids, and are a permanent drain on the societies or other institutions. Since this matter was discussed in the House before I have had complaints from various parts of the country on this question.  I do not want to deal with these now, but I wish to mention a few cases in my own experience as a medical certifier.  The first case I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister is number 8879, Slainte Insurance Society.  The first certificate was issued on 21st February, 1928.  This person was discharged as being fit to resume work on 26th March, 1928.  No payment was made until after he had been discharged as being fit to resume work. Number 22116, Slainte Insurance Society, is another case.  The first certificate was issued on 10th January, the first payment was made on 15th March, and there was no communication or acknowledgment whatever from the Society during that period.  I may mention that I brought these cases to the notice of the National Health Insurance Commission after a reasonable period had elapsed, and that eventually resulted in payment.  I could cite further cases but I do not suppose it is necessary.  I could cite half a dozen cases in my own experience since this matter was discussed here before where the very greatest difficulty was experienced in extracting benefits out of insurance societies. 
     
     When one comes to consider the cost of administration of this particular service one would expect that it would be administered more efficiently.  The total cost of administration in 1926, the latest year for which figures are available, was about £180,000, and yet in spite of that enormous figure for administering the National Health Insurance people are unable to secure benefits when they are ill.  I think one of the great difficulties is the multiplicity of   societies, and the different societies being in different financial circumstances there is no uniformity of benefit. Another considerable drawback&mdash;and it is a very big question that, I presume, we cannot discuss now&mdash;is that no treatment is provided, and that all these people are entitled to under the National Health Insurance is a medical certificate that they are unfit to work. Of course, they get certain benefits from their societies.  The fact that no treatment is provided means the people have to go to the dispensaries in most cases, and as we know there is a certain taint of pauperism attaching to the dispensary service.  To my mind, if this service were entirely taken over and administered by the Public Health Department it would be more efficiently administered than it is at present.  I think it ought to be administered as a department of Public Health, and as a part of the State services.  It is an extraordinary fact&mdash;and the Minister for Local Government is responsible for this particular Department&mdash;that its inspectorial staff is costing upwards of £28,000 per annum.  I fail to see what return is given for that, and what all these inspectors are doing.  I think if the Minister for Local Government had complete control of the administration of this Department he would find that he could put into operation some of the suggestions we made yesterday on the Local Government Vote with regard to the co-ordination of his work, and that some of the inspectors engaged in other sub-departments of the Department of Local Government could carry out inspections under this National Health Insurance. 
     For instance, the medical inspector goes to a certain district to carry out ordinary inspectorial work under the Department of Local Government. I do not see any reason why he should not be able to examine a patient and decide whether such person was physically fit to resume work or not.  Certain classes of people are bound by law to have National Health Insurance cards stamped.  It is hard to understand why it is necessary to have what for all practical purposes is a civil police force in the form of inspectors, at enormous cost, going about to see that people comply with those   provisions.  We have a police force in this part of the country, and I fail to see why they should not be able to secure that people comply with this law as they do in the case of other laws.  I do not know that anything very much can be done, but I think the Minister has not been fully aware of the very serious difficulty insured people labour under in securing these benefits.  If it is necessary to scrap this Department and take complete control to secure efficiency, then the sooner the Minister for Local Government does it the better. 
     
      
       I am not going to delay the House by reiterating every word said by my colleague, Deputy Dr. Ward, but I would like to make a few suggestions to the Department of Local Government from what may be interpreted as a novel point of view.  National insurance is a system necessary for any country which claims to have any respect for democracy.  We have to cater for the sick and the afflicted as best we can, and for those who can subscribe in a small way to insurance we have to insure them not alone against death, but against temporary unemployment and disablement.  My interpretation of and objection to the old English Department of Local Government was that it did not govern this country from the Irishman's point of view, but from the Englishman's, and I am suggesting to the Minister that he is simply following on false footsteps when he is not changing it from that of the British regime to the Irish point of view.  The whole mistake in the present Irish Government is that we are following the footsteps of the English, and in no place is it more conspicuous than in the Local Government Department.  There is no change.  I am not going to suggest that there are not things in British administration that we cannot take and use for our own benefit.  They have adopted national insurance from another nation and we can interpret the best of that system for ourselves.  In Ireland at present in relation to all forms of local government there is a medical service. I have a definition of medical services that applies generally, and no one can   argue that there is a difference in medical services as between one system and another, say as between public health and national health insurance. 
       The appointment of medical officers is a step in the right direction and will lead to a far bigger development than we have any idea of at the moment.  I think there should be one medical head for every area for everything that comes within the ordinary layman's interpretation or definition of medical jurisprudence or the particular sphere of a medical officer.  Anyone who knows anything about poor law dispensaries knows that there is no more disgraceful way of attempting to do even the ordinary justice that a medical officer at a dispensary intends to do for his patient, than is attempted under the present system.  I am not speaking of the urban areas, but of the city dispensaries.  I have practical experience of individuals who are supposed to dispense, within a given period of at the most two hours, sometimes 250 prescriptions, if a man could possibly do that.  One or two mistakes are bound to happen in the case of the individual who dispenses.  He may not dispense the prescription properly.  I cannot visualise 250 patients going into a dispensary with ordinary complaints and being prescribed for in the same manner as a private physician dealing with a private patient would prescribe for him.  It is a physical impossibility, but that is the system in every city in Ireland at the present. 
     
     
      
       Has that anything to do with the Vote?  I feel it is a little bit remote from it.  I thought the Deputy would come to the Vote, and I was waiting for him. 
     
     
      
       I am suggesting that national health expenditure could be applied to general health services in Ireland. 
     
     
      
       This is a vote for the administration of the National Health Insurance Acts, and the point the Deputy raises is relevant to the Department of Local Government proper.  This is a question of the National Health Insurance Acts and not national health generally. 
     
     
     
      
       What I am suggesting is that the Minister might extend the system. 
     
     
      
       What the Deputy wants is a new Act. 
     
     
      
       At this hour of the day you might have asked us to anticipate and say that in the near future you would apply for an Act which might extend to the dispensing of medicine and bring the full medical benefit to Ireland, as we see elsewhere in Germany or England.  I am suggesting that National Health Insurance at present is a certain amount of waste, because you have not extended it sufficiently in other directions which possibly might save money in your Department. What I am really trying to say is National Health Insurance cannot stand on its own footing.  It must include all medical services within Ireland.  If I am in order by calling it national insurance I will do so. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is not in order in referring to these matters by calling them national health insurance.  I am giving him as much latitude as I can, but he cannot come into order by simply mentioning national health insurance.  This Estimate is entirely for the expenses of administration connected with the National Health Insurance Acts.  This is not the time or place to advocate an amendment of these Acts or the repeal of these Acts, which I understand is advocated by some people. 
     
     
      
       You will admit that it is the only opportunity we have of hinting at it. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy has hinted at it for ten minutes.  That is a long time for hinting. 
     
     
      
       I am only suggesting that, on the next opportunity we have, the Minister will increase his demand on us, and that in the meantime he may possibly produce an Act that will really deal, from the national insurance point of view, with necessitous cases, and will provide for benefit for certain men out of work.  I am not going to criticise the Minister for the manner in which the Act is administered   at present.  I am not an exception to other members who have had many applications in cases of hardship. There is no question that at present there are many cases that, in my personal opinion&mdash;and I am trying to judge it as impartially as I possibly can&mdash;appear to have a reasonably fair claim for sympathetic consideration, and who have not got that from the Department.  I am quite prepared to admit that those who are charged with the administration of that particular branch, and are employed in the Department&mdash;I am not talking of the Minister&mdash;are not paid by the State for giving sympathetic consideration to such cases, but at the same time I would suggest that we, the Irish people, at any rate, have always boasted that we were prepared to look after our own poor people.  If we want to keep our own people within the country, and that we intend to provide for them as best we can, through the National Health Insurance scheme we have a method of dealing with them from a health point of view.  That is the essence of the whole Act.  At any rate it is the essence of the foundation of the Act.  It is not an Act of this House, but I think every member would wish it to be interpreted in the most beneficial manner, and that every member would try to be as charitable as he possibly can.  At the present moment this Dail is not able to give the whole population the necessities of life.  This House is responsible for not giving the people even the ordinary necessities to maintain their health, and therefore we must provide for them from the point of view of national health. 
     
     I would suggest seriously that it is really the duty of the Minister, if possible, to err even in sympathy and in charity, not alone in the ordinary way of providing grants through the unemployment section of the Act, but also under the sickness part of the Act and, above all, in regard to the section of the Act dealing with blind people.  I do not know whether it is connected with the present Vote, but it is a bone of contention everywhere.  There are certain people who perhaps according to your medical officers are not totally   blind, but is there any individual at present in Ireland who would employ a person wearing black glasses? Would they employ him in any business, no matter what it is?  No person who walks into an office wearing black glasses will get employment.  Such persons are rejected and anybody else is employed.  They are absolutely denied employment because they are, to a percentage, blind.  It may be 25 or 20 per cent.  They are cast absolutely on the poor law system, and the National Health Insurance Authorities turn them down because they are not totally blind.  Until such time as we have sufficient respect not to want to brand Union clothes as Union clothes, there is only one other way of giving an individual who wants to be respectable what he is justly entitled to receive and what he has actually paid for, and that is through a National Health Insurance scheme.  If the Local Government Department and the Minister would treat these cases with a little more sympathy than they have been treated, that is all I am asking for.  You would not destroy every bit of originality they possess by making them paupers instead of respectable Irishmen? 
     
      
       I wish to say a few words in connection with this Vote. The valuation of an approved society is made every five years.  The last valuation was made in 1923, and the next will be carried out in December, 1928.  The surplus accruing in each society will be distributed for the following five years amongst contributors, with the result that some wealthy societies are able to afford hospital treatment, dental treatment, and other advantages for their contributors, while other societies cannot afford anything beyond the ordinary benefit. That is very unfair to those societies who cannot afford to give the extra benefit.  It is very unfair to societies that they cannot give the same benefits as societies which have a large surplus. In that connection I would suggest to the Minister, if it is possible, that the surplus should be pooled amongst the different societies and an equal proportion given to the contributors   of the various societies.  Then there is the case of a contributor who has been paying in for years to an insurance society&mdash;a married man, for instance.  When he dies at sixty or sixty-five years of age his widow gets no benefit, even though he would not receive any benefit from his society during his lifetime.  I believe that there should be some clause inserted in the Act whereby the widow of a contributor should get either a gratuity or some burial benefit.  Certainly some benefit should be given in cases of that kind. 
       Under present circumstances there is no clause in the Act that would allow that to be done.  Then you have cases where employers are more or less careless in sending in cards, or where perhaps, the fault is the agents' in not collecting and forwarding cards to the society.  If the cards are late in being handed in benefit is not payable for four weeks later.  I think there should be some clause put into the Act, so that in cases where it was not the fault of the individual who was claiming benefit, he would be paid by his society.  The Act allows an individual to claim from an employer, but we all know that the employer will not pay benefit.  He stamps the cards and he gives it to the insured person.  If a person was working for a firm in a town one could understand that the cards would be handed in when the half year was up. In the rural districts you have cases where cards are not stamped until it is thought that the employees are going to claim benefits under the Act.  I think it is unfair that a contributor or an employee should be deprived of benefit in this way. 
     
     I have been connected with one society since the inauguration of the Act, and I believe if a little more was contributed, both by employer and employee, the latter, on attaining the age of 65 years, could be given a pension. The awkward thing about the matter is that under the rules of the House Deputies are not allowed to make suggestions when dealing with the general Estimate.  It is very hard on contributors, whose cards are not handed in to the societies in time, that they should be deprived of benefit for four weeks.   I think that is a great hardship.  For instance, if a person were insured since 1912, if all his insurance cards were handed in up to last January, and if the last card was then late that person would be deprived of benefit, even though he never drew benefit before.  I could speak for a long time on this subject and make suggestions, but that would not be in order at this stage.  I appeal to the Minister to take this matter into consideration. 
     
      
       I have been looking over the Estimates and, to my mind, the cost of administration seems to be out of all proportion to the benefit that the Act gives the country.  The cost at headquarters is, I think, a matter that would bear considerable pruning and, I think, could bear it without any disadvantage to the working of the National Health Insurance Commission. No doubt when the Act was first brought into operation three Commissioners may have been necessary.  It was new, difficult and intricate work, and perhaps required a great deal of attention from expert people to deal with it.  Nowdays it is routine work, work that anybody going into that office, with ordinary intelligence, would be able to perform, I imagine, after a few weeks.  I think that some effort ought to be made by the Department to cut down the heavy cost at headquarters.  There is one chairman at £1,500 yearly and bonus, I presume, and two other Commissioners with, I think, £1,200 each, with bonus.  There is also a chief clerk at £1,000 with bonus, I presume.  The Minister may have looked into the matter and found that all these officials are absolutely required, and that the Department could not be conducted efficiently without them.  I do not think that is so.  I would be glad if the Minister would look into the matter, and if he would tell us whether it would be possible, in his opinion, to run the Department cheaper.  Of course I know that there would be difficulties.  The officials were there and were taken over and cannot be got rid of, perhaps, in a hurry, but work, where their abilities might be equally usefully employed with advantage to the Saorstat, might be found for them as vacancies arise in   other Departments.  I think, and others have mentioned it in previous years, that the Department seems overstaffed, and that the weight of expenditure at headquarters is out of proportion to the amount of benefit that the country derives from it. 
       There is just one point which, perhaps, the Minister will be able to tell us about.  There are large surpluses in a number of these societies.  How are these surpluses from years of working disposed of?  We know that in some cases extra benefits, medical and otherwise, are given to members, but if the Minister can give a rough sketch of how the surpluses are disposed of I think it would be of interest. Then there is the question of the number of societies.  There is nothing new in that point; it was discussed before.  If efforts have been made recently in connection with the unification of societies in Ireland we would like to hear of them.  There are too many societies, and the redundancy means that the cost of officialdom is too great.  A number of the smaller societies have been amalgamated. Others might be amalgamated with advantage to the country and to the insured persons. 
     
     
      
       Much that I would like to say on this Vote has been said by other Deputies.  My principal point is in connection with the delay in the administration of insurance benefits. Weeks often elapse before a working man gets benefit that is due to him. One of the evils that I see is the number of societies.  I would not amalgamate societies at all; I would abolish them and work the Insurance Act under the Insurance Commissioners. There is duplication everywhere.  Perhaps the staff and the cost of it is necessary.  Our contention is that the amount paid in benefit is out of all proportion to the salaries paid to the staffs.  The staffs of the societies have to be paid out of the contributions, and if you do away with the societies I contend that there would be more money available from that saving for sickness benefit.  I will give a case in point which shows one of the evils that arise.  An individual paid up his insurance contributions from May,   1923, to December, 1927, and then fell sick.  He got certificates for ten weeks, but got no benefit on the grounds that he was not registered, as he thought he was, with the Irish National Foresters, nor with any other society.  He went to the inspector, and, weeks having passed, he was finally told to apply for arbitration.  He applied for arbitration, but a month has passed since then.  That person is now four months out of work and has got no benefit. If the societies were not there, and if this Act was administered nationally&mdash; and it is one of the services which calls for nationalisation&mdash;that man would have got benefit.  Delay in giving benefit often results in bringing families to the point of starvation, and consequently, as I pointed out, this service calls for nationalisation. 
     
     
      
       Will you allow me to correct my figures?  I find that the benefits paid are £197,000, roughly. The cost of the office is £86,700, and what is paid in the administration of the societies is £21,700, making a total of £108,541, and when to that is added nearly £37,000 that is paid for medical certification, the total expenses are £145,500, as against benefits of £197,000 paid. 
     
     
      
       To the amount that Sir James Craig has mentioned could also be added the sum of £5,400 for audit. Before the discussion on this Vote closes I hope that the House will have some assurance from the Minister that this whole question of national health insurance will be looked into.  A commission, or committee, sat on this question three years ago and made certain recommendations.  I do not know whether these recommendations have been turned down by the Department, but I am sure that some of them would bear further consideration, and that some of them might even be adopted. As Deputy French said, we have in this country a system of insurance which is based on the industrial requirements of a large country like England, and which is not suitable for us.  In this respect it was mentioned that a good deal of the time of the national health insurance officials was   taken up with unemployment insurance work.  The expenses in connection with the Department also are very heavy in proportion to the benefits which the country receives.  I think that the overhead expenses under unemployment insurance come to about £114,000, so that it ought to be possible, if the question were gone into in a national manner and in the way that Deputy French has suggested in connection with the whole revision of national health insurance, to bring these services together or, if not to amalgamate them, at least to effect considerable economies. 
       We have not the same amount of benefit as they have in Great Britain and Northern Ireland; we have no contributory pensions for insured persons at 65 or for their wives.  I understand that there are certain benefits for married women in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland which we have not here; but in spite of the fact that we have not these benefits, and that we have not medical benefits, we have a state of affairs that the central administration, leaving out the approved societies' expenses, cost in 1925 3s. 81⁄4d. for insured persons, whereas in England it cost only 1s. 4d.  I know that in England there is a much larger number of persons, and that under a system such as this, where you have so many red-tape regulations, your overhead expenses are bound to be proportionately higher in this country.  Nevertheless, it ought to have been possible, since the present Government came into office, to reduce expenditure somewhat more than has been done. 
     
     While it might not be possible to give the benefits that have been given in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, there are certain benefits which could be given, especially in the poorer districts throughout the country.  I am sure that a great many Deputies are aware that the Dudley nursing scheme in the congested districts depended to a great extent for support on the amounts which were available from National Health Insurance Society sources.  I understand that they have dispensary nursing services in most of these areas where you have migration to England for seasonal work, and that a great many of these dispensaries   have been closed down.  I know that the Minister is particularly interested in the Gaeltacht, and is anxious to do what he can for it.  I hope he will be able to resume these services, and even extend them, as soon as possible. 
     Then there is the question of tuberculosis. The local authorities at present have to bear a larger burden than they should be expected to in connection with the treatment of that disease, and the Central Government ought to endeavour to give more financial assistance for the treatment of tuberculosis. There is also the question of the provision of school meals for children in rural districts.  In a large number of urban districts meals are being provided through the urban district councils. 
     
      
       We have passed away from the Local Government Estimate, and we are now on National Health Insurance. 
     
     
      
       This is one of the recommendations made by this Commission which sat three years ago.  I think if other Deputies were in order in suggesting various benefits which could be given, that there is no reason why I should not be allowed to do so. 
     
     
      
       Except that it would mean legislation. 
     
     
      
       So would all the other things. 
     
     
      
       In any case there are constant complaints from the other side that they never get suggestions.  It has been pointed out also that approved societies have large surpluses and that these surpluses could be made available for giving additional benefits.  It has been mentioned to me, in connection with future policy, that the Minister may be likely to depend largely on the 1918 to 1923 figures.  During that period, of course, National Health Insurance was probably in a more flourishing condition from the point of view of contributions than it will be at any time in the future.  If charges are contemplated the period from 1923 to 1928 must, of course, be regarded as a lean period.  I suggest that the Minister should hold out some hope for an extension of benefit, and at the same time   some economies in administration, which would reduce this enormous cost per insured person.  The approved societies are supposed to carry on their work at a cost of 4/5d. per person, and when the Central Commission in Dublin takes over the work of a society which, for some reason or other, is not able to carry on, I believe that they are not able to do the work at anything like the rate that is statutorily laid down.  There ought to be an endeavour to standardise expenditure and to standardise benefits, so that all societies would pay the same benefits and incur the same expenditure. 
     
     
      
       The total amount of benefit distributed for the year 1927 was £666,800.  While, no doubt, the costs of administration do appear large, they ought to be taken into consideration in relation to that figure, and not in relation to the amount of the State grant.  I do consider that three Commissioners are not necessary to run the National Health Insurance Commission at present.  I have given some consideration to that, and no doubt it will be possible in due course to make some economy in that direction. But whether any greater economising in the general machinery, without changing the whole system, could be brought about is a thing that I question. 
     
     Criticism has been directed to the fact that there has been delay in the making of payments from the societies. Considering that the number of persons normally in receipt of benefit per week is about 21,500, or, say 22,000, the number of complaints that reach the Commission is very small.  There are many reasons causing delay in the cases where delay does occur.  I think we might take it that if 22,000 people are being dealt with weekly that the number of complaints is comparatively small.  Deputy Ward mentioned two cases&mdash;one on the 21st February, 1928. When that case was brought before the Commissioners, the result was that the claim was paid in full by the 21st March, that is, inside a month, and the cause of the delay was stated by the society to be that the wrong membership number was furnished, and that, therefore, correspondence arose.  The second case mentioned by Deputy   Ward arose on the 10th January, 1926, and he said that the first payment was made on the 15th March.  My information is that the first payment was made on the 3rd March, and the cause of the delay was stated to be the failure of the member and the local agent to furnish a medical certificate.  There are points in such cases which Deputy Kennedy brought up of persons who do not take the trouble to see how they stand with their societies until sickness or accident strikes them.  The Commission will do all they can to bring defaulting societies to book where the society appears to be seriously in fault. With regard to delay the Commissioners have power to wind up that society and transfer its business to a better-run society. 
     
      
       Might I ask the Minister, as a result of his explanation of these examples given by Deputy Ward, if these are exceptions rather than the rule, and that it is the desire of the Department where sick people would go into hospital or undergo any treatment that the benefits should be immediately paid? 
     
     
      
       As far as the benefits to people in hospitals are concerned, there are regulations with regard to them, and if there is any delay the Commissioners will deal with it in the same way.  But I say that the volume of complaint is comparatively small.  The question has been raised about some societies paying more benefits than other societies.  It is impossible to avoid that.  If you have well-run societies with a very large number of members, it is possible for them to pay benefits that a small society cannot pay.  No society accumulates a surplus above the statutory quantity or the quantity allowed by the regulations of the Commissioners, and when there are surpluses these surpluses are expended in additional benefits of various kinds. The benefits are very many.  In actual practice, there are eighty societies, and of these additional benefits are given as follows:&mdash;Dental benefit is given by 56 societies and 19 branches; hospital benefit by 45 societies and 14 branches; optical benefits by 34 societies and 19 branches, and the provision of medical   and surgical appliances by 8 societies and 17 branches. 
       So far as the Commissioners are concerned, they have a scheme of adding various useful additional benefits, and the societies put these schemes into force when they have a fund, and according to their own option.  It would be impossible without changing the law to alter the system of securing a flat condition in the different societies. While the Deputies who spoke about a national scheme of national health insurance were a bit outside the scope of the discussion, nevertheless I welcome their contribution to the discussion dealing with our general national health insurance problem. It is inevitable that in a wide-flung and intricate piece of insurance organisation, when it is developed in the country and left to grow for a number of years, a particular kind of organisation and vested interests growing around it, that it is very difficult to deal in a revolutionary way with it, except a way is seen very clearly and the results are very clear.  Whether we can improve the present system by developing it in a more or less organic way, or whether it is to be radically changed, is a question that we can hardly take a decision on at this particular moment. We would require time for further investigation of the matter, and we would require time for a further sensing of the national pulse by way of what it would desire in the way of a national health insurance scheme, or what it would desire by way of a particular scheme. 
       Vote put and agreed to. 
     
   
   
     IN COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - VOTE 44&mdash;HOSPITALS AND INFIRMARIES. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Go ndeontar suim na raghaidh thar £1,228 chun slanuithe na suime is ga chun ioctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith inioctha i rith na bliana dar crioch an 31adh la de Mharta, 1929, chun Eilithe mar gheall ar Ospideil agus Otharlanna maraon le hIldeontaisi i gCabhair. 
     
     That a sum not exceeding £1,228 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which   will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for charges connected with Hospitals and Infirmaries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid. 
     
      
       There are old grants to hospitals under existing statutes.  They were originally given in accordance with the recommendations of a Committee of the House of Commons in 1854 and a Commission of 1855.  Some of the hospitals have, in fact, received this grant of public money as far back as the eighteenth century. 
     
     
      
       It seems to me strange that this Vote should come up here in this fashion.  Looking over the debates of former years, I find that in 1925 a promise was made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that a Commission or Committee of Inquiry&mdash;I think he called it a Consultative Committee&mdash;would be set up to examine this grant to hospitals and infirmaries.  It was realised then that in the selection of these particular hospitals for grants something in the nature of favouritism was associated with them.  Now we know that this House is not responsible for this list or for the amounts in this list.  As the Minister has said, these grants were arranged for under recommendations by a British House of Commons Committee 70 years ago or more, and they have been granted these moneys from year to year since in accordance with these recommendations. 
     
     But this House has now been some years in existence, and while we would not expect that in the first year or two they would have time to look into everything, especially small matters of this kind&mdash;and this is a small matter&mdash; nevertheless when a promise was made three years ago, when this Estimate was up for consideration, by the Minister, who definitely stated that the matter would be looked into and a committee set up to see if some redistribution of these amounts might not be made.  I would like to know why such a promise was not kept.  I would not like to see these grants taken away from   these particular hospitals.  If we can afford it, I would like to see the grant increased, not alone to these hospitals, but to many other hospitals in Dublin and many other places in different parts of the country.  The hospitals here selected are: Westmorland Lock Hospital, Rotunda Lying-in Hospital, Coombe Lying-in Hospital, House of Industry Hospitals, Cork Street Fever Hospital, Meath Hospital, Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dr. Steevens' Hospital, and the Royal Hospital for Incurables.  These are all doing good work.  There is no doubt in the world about that.  But I believe that these grants were made to these hospitals under the opinion perhaps that these and most of the other hospitals that were then in existence were doing free work and giving free medical aid to the poorest section of the community.  They are not giving that free medical assistance to the same extent now&mdash;either these or the other hospitals not included in the list.  The poor do not get, to the same extent, the medical attendance free from these hospitals that they used to get.  And that applies not alone to these hospitals, but all round, and that is owing to the subject we have been discussing just now, the National Health Insurance. There is something paid now in the vast majority of cases by the patients in these hospitals.  In the majority of cases people cannot pay the full amount for their keep and medical attendance, but they do pay something. 
     I think it is time that an inquiry of some kind should be made into this Vote, and if there could be a redistribution on a fair basis all round amongst the hospitals that are doing work similar to what these hospitals have been doing in the past and are still continuing to do, it would be very welcome.  These hospitals have been giving medical attendance to the poor and, in particular, to that element of the poor that is so poor that it cannot afford to pay anything.  I do think such hospitals should be generously treated so far as our purse will allow. I made up my mind that the matter would not go without protest from me. I think this grant, as at present arranged under this recommendation   of 1854 should not be continued from year to year; there should be a full consideration of the position and a redistribution on a fair basis.  I want to be fair all round, and I think this House would like to be fair all round. There certainly has been time within the last three years to make investigation into this matter.  I do not want to challenge the Vote in a matter of this kind.  The least we expect is that before this Estimate comes up again all this matter will have been inquired into and the whole subject brought before the House so that a redistribution may be made. 
     
      
       I am glad Deputy O'Kelly reminded the Minister of his predecessor's promise, because I had intended doing so.  The year 1855 is not so very fresh in the memory of any Deputy except, perhaps, Deputy Sheehy.  It is more or less obvious from the figures given in the Estimates that the conditions have changed substantially since that early period. These figures, particularly the figures showing the estimated expenditure of the different hospitals, present a variety of anomalies.  There is the Coombe Lying-in Hospital, which I will take as an example.  It is in one of the poorest districts of Dublin and it is doing very valuable work.  That hospital receives just about two and a half per cent. of its total estimated expenditure. On the other hand, as regards the House of Industry Hospitals, I do not know what they are or where they are.  The only House of industry I know is the Dail, and I do not know that there is any hospital connected with it at present.  They get no less than 38 per cent. of the total estimated expenditure. 
     
     Let us take the last two on the list. Dr. Steevens' Hospital has a deficiency of income of £4,600, and, towards that deficiency we give £1,300.  The Royal Hospital for Incurables has a deficiency of £5,780 and we only give them £250. It is obvious that the conditions have altered since the Committee of the House of Commons of 1854 and the Commission of 1855 made their recommendations. The most startling case is the Cork Street Fever Hospital.  I   would like to say the Cork very quietly and the Street very loudly, for fear any Deputy would be afraid that I wanted to extract money for the Southern metropolis.  In fact, in this connection I believe that this particular street was so named in the hope that the Corkmen whom some unkind fate compelled to reside temporarily in the Metropolis would come and live there, but, unfortunately, the supply of Corkmen was not equal to the demand, and premises became vacant there and they were converted into a hospital.  The hospital has an estimated deficiency of income of just about £1,800&mdash;£1,782 to be very correct.  To make up that deficiency of income we give them £2,500.  Cork Street Hospital is living, I must say, most admirably up to its name, and it succeeds in making £700 a year.  I do not want to prejudge the case before the Committee.  It is quite possible that the £700 a year is paying off a deficit created before 1855. 
     There certainly does appear to be a case for inquiry by a Committee into this payment and also, as Deputy O'Kelly said, into the position of other Dublin hospitals doing equally valuable work.  There are some hospitals that have small endowments.  No doubt the fact that they had endowments was held to rule them out of consideration by the House of Commons Committee.  But these endowments are not worth now what they were worth in 1854 and 1855. There are, to my certain knowledge, hospitals doing useful and valuable work that would have a claim to appear before the Commission and submit a case.  They might possibly be found equally deserving of State support, just as much as any of the hospitals that appear on this list here.  I would urge the Minister to fulfil his predecessor's pledge and set up either a Departmental Committee, a Commission, or a Committee of the Dail.  I am quite certain that we would get fair treatment from any one of them.  I think there is a case for inquiry, because 1928 is not 1855.  I do not suggest that we should reject this Estimate.  Obviously the hospitals rely on the receipt of this money, and they should have very full notice and fair warning before we alter the amount paid to them&mdash;increase or   decrease it.  It is really a case for setting up a Committee to go into the whole matter  de novo , particularly from the point of view of the circumstances in which we are living and the circumstances in which our grandfathers lived. 
     
      
       There is one rather peculiar and conspicuous fact about this whole grant.  We are honestly living in a most peculiar age.  We have had five, six or seven years with Parliament under the full control of the Irish people, and here we are to-day accepting something that was handed down to us since 1854.  The one most extraordinary fact&mdash;and I am certainly not going to be branded as a bigot in any sense of the word&mdash;is that there is not an institution amongst those to which we are about to give the grants-in-aid that is controlled by the religion of the Irish people.  Also, the whole grants are confined within the City of Dublin.  Certainly Dublin is not Ireland, nor is it the Free State. There are certain hospitals equally as well equipped throughout the rest of Ireland as we have in this little city that even, at the present moment, they are attempting to make greater than it is.  We are perfectly satisfied with our own, but I think there are institutions outside Dublin that should be considered in a Vote of this kind, particularly when the payments are made out of the revenue of the nation.  I would recommend to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that the sooner he would change the allocation of this particular amount the better in order to suit the wishes of the Irish people.  I am not going to press my first point, but I think it is a really peculiar fact, and it should be changed as soon as possible. 
     
     I would prefer that this nation would subsidise hospitals provided that they were institutions prepared to publish balance sheets and ready to receive poor people and those who are able only partially to subscribe towards their treatment.  It would also come well within the Ministry's purview to consider whether local bodies should subscribe, and that the nation should take, more or less, the whole burden, even if it meant legislation and the striking   of a new rate for the purpose.  I am not going into that matter now, because I am afraid I would be ruled out. The point I want to get at is that it is not fair to ask the Dail to pass any grant originated by people who never understood Ireland.  We are asked to vote money on a recommendation made by a Commission of the British House of Commons in 1854.  That explains the mentality of this House at the present moment. 
     We are dealing with that, not only upon this Estimate, but we dealt with it also on the last Estimate.  This is a grant to hospitals in Ireland, but there is not a hospital in it outside Dublin. Let it be said that this is a grant to the Dublin hospitals and then we will understand it.  We have in Ireland more modern hospitals outside Dublin than in the City of Dublin. 
     
      
       This is an estimate for £16,228.  I think the reaction on Deputy French is probably to the reference to the British House of Commons, because the fact really is that we are discussing a continuance of this grant to nine hospitals in the City of Dublin, whose whole economy, during the last eighty years at any rate, has, to a certain extent, centred around the fact that whether the grant is a big or a small grant they get it each year.  With the exception of one or two, there is not a single one of these hospitals, even though the grant reaches them, that has not a deficit. There is one that the grant leaves without a deficit.  That is a hospital that discharges very valuable functions in the city in connection with infectious diseases, and we may leave that aside; but there are eight other hospitals ministering in the city, and the grant affects very materially their economy, and they have had it for the last eighty years or so. 
     
     I do not know what undertaking may have been given by my predecessor in connection with this matter, but what I feel very much myself in connection with it is that it would be rather unreasonable to propose to withdraw this grant from those hospitals that already, over and above the grants, have a deficit.  If you set up a committee to inquire into what are going to do   with this £16,000, you are going to find it very difficult to get out of any such inquiry without being forced, in one way or another, to open the State purse very much more towards the upkeep generally of hospitals.  I think that if the question of State grants to hospitals is to be opened up at all it ought to be opened up in a general way; but owing to the amount of money involved and the traditions of these particular hospitals, I feel very reluctant, personally, to do anything but to recommend to the House the continuance of this grant. 
     
      
       The point I was suggesting was: Could not, for instance, a Deputy for Mayo establish a case for a hospital in Mayo as fairly as the Minister tries to establish a case for these particular hospitals? 
     
     
      
       He could, but the Deputy here is confusing the discharge of national duties to Mayo in present-day circumstances.  None of these hospitals is in a very flourishing condition.  They show a very definite deficit, and they are traditionally entitled to this particular grant.  There is a kind of Statute of Limitations which, it will be agreed, has arisen in connection with their claim to it, but the idea of sitting down to discuss the taking away of £700 from a hospital with a deficit of £1,100, and so on, I must say, does not appeal to me. 
     
     
      
       If the Minister is convinced, on his own argument, that the Westmorland Lock Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital, the Coombe Lying-in Hospital, and the Houses of Industry have failed financially, it strikes me that there is a greater service for the particular area than is necessary.  The City of Dublin has a particular obligation to support the Dublin Union, formerly the North and South Unions. Along with that there is handed down to us a sort of hospital expenditure from sources that never catered for the Irish people, for whom we are interested to minister.  I am not really grumbling about the £16,000 being expended, but it is a strange fact that a certain number of institutions of a peculiar nature are subsidised out of   national funds and that this should be handed down to this House, so that we are asked every year to pass this sum without considering any other part of the country.  I, personally, would honestly prefer that the Minister would ask for this grant of £16,000 to equip the Dublin Union with a modern hospital for the service of the city poor. I strongly object to pass this Vote with out an assurance that the whole thing is absolutely necessary, and that the Irish people, of all religions, are getting fair treatment from these hospitals. This matter comes down to us from the English House of Commons since 1854, and that is sufficient to make me suspect it unless I have a definite assurance that it is absolutely straight and above board.  I believe we have a responsibility for the Dublin Union, and ought only to give voluntary subscriptions to other hospitals outside. This Vote is a voluntary contribution by the English Parliament to certain institutions in Ireland.  I am not going to agree to pass that until I know where I am.  It is the primary duty today of this Dail to look after the Dublin Union, and after that we can consider giving charitable donations to other institutions which we believe will give reasonable treatment to every citizen irrespective of every other consideration.

       That a sum not exceeding £116,012 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education, including the cost of Administration, Inspection, etc. 
     
     
     
      
       Deputies will notice that in the various Votes for which I am responsible there is not, on the whole, very much change in the actual amounts between this year and last year.  Roughly speaking, the amount is something in the neighbourhood of £4,600,000.  I must say that it is not a Vote in which I can foresee very considerable savings in the future. Probably, as long as we are in this House and there is a Minister for Education, he will have to face demands, not for diminished, but for increased expenditure, and however much he may be convinced of the undesirability of placing fresh burdens by means of taxation, undoubtedly there will be many of those demands that he will not be able altogether to resist, and that possibly the Minister for Finance will not be able to resist.  There will be many other purposes, too, for which expenditure of public money in connection with education may be highly desirable, but which, however, owing to the financial exigencies of the time, may have to be postponed. 
       I think there is a considerable number of Deputies of all parties who are convinced of the vital importance to this country of continually improving our system of education.  I do not say that that is a feeling that is shared universally in the country, but I think there is a pretty general feeling among the different Deputies that that is so. They realise that it is important to us morally in the building up of our people individually, important to us nationally and economically.  Our policy has been strongly to hold that it is impossible to separate those three factors, that they are intimately connected: the moral advance, the advance of the character of the individual; the advance in national feeling; and the economic advance of the nation as a whole. 
     
     I should like to say a few words about the economic aspect.  We must remember that for a variety of reasons we are not in the fortunate position that possibly some other countries are. So far as we know, we have not the same supply of raw materials that they have.  We are not a virgin country like   some of the new countries which are rich.  We have to depend, perhaps, more than is the case in other countries, even in Europe, on the trained ability of our people.  Other countries have realised that.  They have especially realised it since the war.  Notwithstanding the financial stringencies which have accompanied the war and peace, they have made sacrifices in this direction.  If we are to hold our own in competition with foreign countries, it is very essential that we continue to improve the training that we give to our young people.  I do not mean merely intellectual training, but character as well, and that is possibly even more important; that we should help to build up the individual national character; that we should teach and inculcate and, so to speak, drive into the people self-respect and self-reliance. We have tried as far as we can, in the limited time at our disposal, and as far as we are able, to work towards the realisation of those aims.  There is much that came from the older system that was good, much that can be utilised.  There is much also that we felt called for reform.  Co-ordination is necessary; various things had to be scrapped; new ideas had to be introduced and improvements made. 
     I think it can be safely said that in the last three or four years there have been gradual improvements made.  The advance has not always been possibly as rapid as we or other Deputies would like, but, on the whole, I think we have tried to advance and that we have succeeded in advancing.  I think any Minister for Education must realise what Deputy Thrift, I think it was, on one occasion said, that really putting the education of this country on a sound foundation, bringing it up to a proper pitch of excellence, is to a certain extent a life's work.  We have not been able to accomplish everything in a couple of years, but we can at least claim that we have looked forward and not backward. 
     Apart from the question of finance, which has imposed certain limitations on us, I should like to refer to another matter which is sometimes forgotten in connection with the work of the Department and the whole system of   education&mdash;it is rather easy to forget it; everybody is inclined to forget it at times&mdash;and that is, that even apart altogether from the difficulty of find-finding money, the powers of the State and of my Department in matters of education are strictly and rather narrowly limited.  Our control is by no means an exhaustive one.  We have by no means a monopoly of the task to provide education for the nation.  We have not a monopoly even of the control of the education of the nation.  Our influence in that matter is, as I say, a limited influence.  We can interfere undoubtedly; we can to a certain extent guide, and do try to guide.  We try to achieve certain aims, but there are limitations to what we can achieve and what we can aim at.  Very often, as a result of that, we have to rely not so much on essentials as possibly on negotiations. 
     A system has grown up here, sometimes undoubtedly under unfavourable circumstances, but still has grown up with the history of the country, that in some respects at least, if not in all, did satisfy some of our deepest and most lasting aspirations.  It may not be as logically rounded off as some of the systems that we find in other portions of Europe, but it was possibly none the less healthy on that account.  I am not complaining that we have not control of the monopoly of education&mdash;quite the contrary.  Personally I strongly believe that if anything of the kind were possible, it would be wrong that we should aim at it.  Conscientiously, I believe there are a certain number who do not feel that they could take on the office of Minister for Education if there was any such monopoly claimed or aimed at. Certainly I think the great bulk of the people neither believe in it nor want it. It limits our control and it means that we cannot always do things as quickly as we should like.  These are things perhaps which from our point of view are to be regretted, but it has had some good effects, apart altogether from the question of general principle and from the question of conscientious beliefs.  It has saved us at least from many devastating conflicts about education that we see in other countries, not merely in Europe, but in other places as well. 
     
        Our system here, however, is, so to speak, a mixture of co-operation, of voluntary effort and State support.  It has its defects, as I say, but it is not without its compensations and its blessings.  It is no harm to remind people occasionally that the Minister for Education and the Department of Education are not the people who educate the country.  They have only a certain limited power to influence the people who educate the country.  We can help and we can stimulate.  We can work for a certain amount of uniformity in aim in the educational systems in the country, but, as I said already, our powers are, to some extent, rather closely limited and defined. Everybody will admit that, ultimately, the education given depends on the teacher.  But if you look at our three main branches of education as they appear in these Estimates and ask yourselves: which class of teacher is under our control&mdash;is appointed by us&mdash;you will find the answer is, &ldquo;None.&rdquo;  We do not appoint the national teacher; we do not appoint the secondary teacher; we do not appoint the technical teacher.  We lay down certain conditions that must be fulfilled in the appointment of each type of teacher, but once these conditions are satisfied the power is practically out of our hands.  That is probaby as it should be.  We provide facilities for the training and equipment of these teachers. 
     Another factor that perhaps I should dwell upon&mdash;a factor which distinguishes the finances of education in this country from the finances of education in every other country that I am acquainted with&mdash;is the incidence of the cost of education.  In practically every other country a very large portion&mdash;very often half and sometimes a great deal more than half&mdash;of the cost is borne by the local authority.  That is so in England.  It is so in Denmark and in France.  It is certainly so in Germany. In the different States of Germany the incidence varies.  In Bavaria the principal portion is borne by the State.  In Prussia, I think, most of the burden is borne by the local authority. Here, practically the whole expense of education is borne by the central authority.  Very little indeed, in comparison, is borne by the local authority. 
     
        There are certain events of importance in connection with the educational life of the country during the last year or couple of years that I should refer to.  The School Attendance Act has come into operation.  Two years ago, it was not in operation.  On the whole, I think the results have been satisfactory &mdash;not perhaps that all the good results so far as percentage of attendance is concerned are immediately to be seen. There have been complaints from here and there about the non-enforcing of the Act for one reason or another.  It is very difficult to estimate the value of these complaints.  In some cases, where complaints have been made by individuals, either by writing into the office or by writing to the local paper, it was apparent that the person writing had a grievance against the local sergeant. Very often the complaints had possibly more foundation than that, but if complaints are made it is well that they should be substantiated.  On the whole, I do not think there has been any slackness on the part of the enforcing authority in enforcing the Act.  As has been pointed out on more than one occasion here, before the Act was passed the school-leaving age, in practice, was very often about 11 years or between 11 years and 12 years.  Some people would put the average school-leaving age in Ireland, before the passing of the Act, at 11 years.  Very often, as has been pointed out here also, children leaving the national school at the age of 14 had reached, not the sixth standard but very often only the third standard. That was very largely due to gross irregularity in attendance even on the part of those who had remained at school up to the age of 14 years. Remember that the Act cannot be expected immediately to show its effects scholastically, if I may put it in that way.  If you take the youngster at the age of 12 years, he now has to attend school regularly from 12 to 14 years. If he had been attending irregularly from 6 years to 12 years, you cannot expect immediate effects from the Act. It is too early yet to judge the scholastic effects of the Act.  It would not be fair to judge the products of the primary system after the Act has been in force for a year or two years, because the irregularity of the earlier years will   still affect the product.  There have been, as was natural to expect, complaints from some parts of the country on economic grounds in connection with the enforcing of the Act.  Parents have written and resolutions have come from public bodies asking me to relieve those responsible of the necessity of sending children of a certain age&mdash;12 years or 13 years&mdash;to school at particular periods of the year.  I have had to write back&mdash;fortunately, perhaps&mdash;that I had no power to do anything of the kind&mdash;that the Act was there and that I could not dispense anybody from obedience to the Act.  It is, perhaps, natural to expect these complaints.  It is natural to expect that only gradually will parents become accustomed to an Act framed for the benefit of the young people.  It is only gradually that parents will begin to realise that, however hard their lot, they will have to sacrifice some immediate economic gain for the lasting advantage of their children. 
     Complaint has been made that the School Attendance Act has not been strictly enforced in the City of Dublin. As to the merits of that complaint I cannot judge.  I might point out that, in some respects, the City of Dublin is an exceptional case owing to the inadequacy of accommodation.  I hope that, in a short time, when the new buildings which are being dealt with are put up, that the principal cause of complaint will be remedied.  In Dublin it may not be so easy to enforce the Act as elsewhere.  That may be a passing phase.  I am anxious, however, to see the complaint more fully substantiated. 
     Another matter that I am able to deal with more definitely than I was on the occasion of the last Estimate is the census of school buildings.  There was, as you know, arrears in connection with school building in the years 1914 to 1924.  During that period building was practically suspended, with the result that very large arrears had to be made up.  A census of school buildings was undertaken by the Department. It was found that there was needed in the country, about a year or 18 months ago, about 350 new schools. There were about 550 schools in which   there was need of fuller accommodation&mdash;possibly due to the result of the School Attendance Act and, perhaps, to other causes.  Then there were about 900 schools in which minor changes were necessary, such as the addition of partitions so as to convert one large class-room into two or three classrooms. Minor changes of that kind have to be undertaken in about 900 schools.  The Board of Works is trying, as fast as it can go, to remedy that situation and to provide adequate school accommodation. 
     The new programme, which came out of the National Programme Conference, has been put into operation.  The reports of the inspectors that I have read are encouraging, so far as that matter is concerned.  There does seem to be a distinct advance there.  Since I last spoke here on this subject a Committee was appointed to inquire into the system of inspection. 
     For one reason or another dissatisfaction was expressed with it.  From the point of the national teachers I think it was said they objected not so much to inspection but they wanted inspection of a somewhat different type, and that the inspector should be not merely a person who came in, as they put it&mdash;too strongly &mdash;as an inquisitor.  They wanted a person who came in and gave them help.  I think that was done even in the old days, but with the heavy task put on the inspector there was not sufficient opportunity given to him to come often enough to the schools to get into close touch with the work and to act as a friendly adviser to the teachers.  As a result of a report of the Inspection Committee we have somewhat modified the system of inspection. We did not think it necessary that the official schools should be inspected every year, as they were practically up to the present.  We suggested there should be more frequent incidental visits, as they are called, so that the inspector, as I indicated, should get more in touch with the actual work done in the schools and be ready to give advice.  I must say before this change was made it was exceedingly difficult, when you consider the amount of work the inspector had to do, often   enough to visit the school so as to give friendly advice of that kind.  As a result of that, we found it necessary to make some slight addition to our inspection staff. 
     The work of inspectors has been referred to on a previous occasion here. I may indicate some of the very heavy work inspectors have to do right through the year, and I think anybody who is intimately acquainted with the system as it works will realis and asknowledge that that work is not merely important but also extremely heavy.  They have the inspection of the schools, and in the area of an inspector under the new system there are about 120 schools. Then they are responsible for conducting the Easter examination that decides the entrance into the training colleges of a certain number of candidates every year.  They conduct examinations in the training colleges of those who have been admitted to training; they superintend the Irish courses, and that would be in about the month of August; they examine into the certificates in Irish; they examine for entrance into the preparatory colleges and for scholarships from the primary to the secondary schools, and they prepare papers for all these examinations. It is only in recent years some of this examination work has been thrust upon them, such, for instance, as the preparatory college examination, the examination in connection with Irish, and so on.  In the ordinary Easter examinations the difficulty of Irish, of course, has given a great deal more importance to the oral side of the examination, and that has increased the work of the inspectors.  We have adopted another recommendation of the committee on inspection, and have circularised the managers in accordance with the recommendation in the report of that committee, asking them to aid us in attempting to set up a primary leaving certificate for the national schools.  This will be voluntary, and not compulsory on the schools, but we hope the managers will co-operate with us in superintending those examinations, and that as many schools as possible will adopt this as a regular portion of their curriculum. 
     
        As I have indicated already the really important thing that will decide in the long run whether the system of education in any country is good or not will depend on the type of teacher you will get.  That is true of any branch of education&mdash;secondary, primary, university or technical.  It is quite true some men are born teachers, and they are the best, but the difficulty is how are you going to get them.  There may be a number of them in the country, but how are you going to find them?  Unfortunately that is rather difficult.  If you could put your hand on 13,000 born teachers and put them into the schools in the morning, it would be very effective, but unfortunately we have to rely on much more routine and work-a-day methods than that in getting teachers. We have to rely on ordinary people who have, perhaps, a certain taste for teaching, who take to this profession for a livelihood, and that is what people see in most professions and businesses, and who have a certain amount of ability.  Having got, not the born teacher, but a man of the ordinary type, the thing is to try as far as possible to make a good teacher out of him.  That is the work of training.  There are two stages in the training of the teacher in connection with our new system. There are, as everybody knows, the training colleges.  Before people can enter a training college they must give proof of ability, proof of knowledge of a certain kind, and they must have even a certain schooling.  Previously there was the monitorial system&mdash;the old pupil-teachership system.  We found that did not produce the particular type of candidate we wanted.  Also, perhaps, there was too much reliance on the mere result of the examination. 
     What we have to aim at is somewhat different, we have tried to change that as far as possible.  By means of the preparatory colleges and the new pupil-teachership system we try to achieve that the persons who enter a training college, or at least a large number of them, will have got a thoroughly sound secondary education.  A certain number of places will be open for competition at the Easter scholarship examination. That examination will gradually approach the type of the leaving certificate   examination, and possibly ultimately might be supplanted by the leaving certificate examination.  Take the ordinary type we hope to have in the future.  They will come from the secondary schools to the training colleges. Pupil-teachers, as a result of their answering at the intermediate certificate examination, will get places in a number of schools and in the preparatory colleges.  In both of these cases special attention must be given to the fact that in future these teachers will have to teach Irish and be able to teach through Irish.  Therefore, we have set up preparatory colleges and staffed them with that particular aim, and the schools to which the pupil-teachers are allotted are also chosen with that particular aim in view. Roughly speaking, the numbers recruited as pupil-teachers in this particular way for the training colleges in the year 1926 were 33 boys, 117 girls. In 1927 72 boys were successful and 76 girls, and 11 extra boys were taken on for one year as pupil-teachers.  The numbers in the preparatory colleges at present are as follow: Marlboro' Hall, 119, one short of filling the accommodation there; in Marlboro' House 32, and roughly speaking that number fills half the accommodation; in the Dingle College 47, roughly speaking half the accommodation, or half the number we ultimately intend to have there.  That might be a more correct way of putting it.  In the Western Girls' College that at the moment is placed in Donegal, owing to the fact that we will have to build a special college for girls in Mayo, you have 47.  That is again about half.  In Ballyconnell, that is the Donegal House, you have 42; 100 would be about the accommodation we will have there. 
     I intend in addition to have two further colleges, one for boys in Connaught and another in Munster, also for boys.  In that way we expect to get teachers who will be able to teach Irish, and people who will be able to avail better of the opportunities they will get for training in the ordinary training colleges.  Meanwhile officials of the Department have made inquiries into the existing training colleges.  These inquiries have been submitted to me, and   I hope in a short time to be able to submit to the various people who have a right to consult with me, the ecclesiastical authorities, the heads of the training colleges and the national teachers, and in communication with them to reach possibly a more satisfactory decision about the future of the training colleges.  There was a question asked in the previous debate about the status of Irish in those colleges, I think, by Deputy Fahy.  My information is that in the most of those colleges undoubtedly there have been great advances made in that particular direction.  In some, as I indicated on that occasion, advances have been more striking than in the case of others, but in all there has been a striking advance.  Now it will be necessary, owing to the shortage of teachers, to provide an additional training college.  We will insist on certain conditions that it would be unfair to impose suddenly on the actually established institutions. 
     In this as in other countries one of the most difficult problems, possibly because its importance has been grasped only more recently, is the question of post-primary education, what you might roughly call technical or continuation education as distinct from that type of education which is secondary education.  In some countries secondary education undoubtedly has so long established itself as an obvious branch of education that there is no discussion about its existence and about the fact that efforts and sacrifices must be made for it. There may be disputes about curriculum and matters of that kind, but it has fully established itself, not merely from the point of view of the educational authorities, but also from that of the people.  It is not so clear in the case of technical education.  Remember, if you guarantee ordinary primary school rudiments of education&mdash;it is at least a belief, I think it probably is unsound&mdash;but, anyway, I see no reason why technical education as education, might not be as good from the purely educational point of view as what goes by the name of secondary education. I cannot see why you cannot train the man, not as a machine, but train his mind as well by means of special   attention to a trade as you could by special attention to a language.  It depends again on the type of education and on the teacher, but in this country, as in others in these matters, we will have to get away from the slip-shod,  laissez faire  methods that might have done well enough a generation ago, but certainly are not such as to enable us to hold our own in the modern world. 
     Now, the system of technical education we inherited is about 25 years old. It had done excellent work in its time. It was still doing solid work in many other respects, but we soon became convinced that the system of technical education should be submitted to an examination.  We appointed a Commission and asked them to look into the whole question.  I should like to thank the members of the inspection Commission for the work they did, and the members of the Technical Commission for the considerable amount of time they had to give to the investigation of this difficult and complicated matter.  The investigations of the Commission lasted much longer than many members of the Commission thought it would when they first joined it, but still all the members of the Commission gave their earnest attention to the work of the Commission from start to finish.  In the old system, owing to the unsatisfactory character of the attendance, very often at the primary schools a boy at fourteen, instead of being in the sixth or the fifth, was in the third or lowest class in some cases, if we can judge from a rather celebrated tabulated system of figures in this House.  Anyhow, the technical schools in the country had to undertake perhaps a lot of work, strictly primary work.  That was not sound.  We hope the School Attendance Act will rid the technical schools of that.  Also there was too much perhaps of what in technical schools is known as &ldquo;commerce,&rdquo; and too little of technical education proper.  We asked the Technical Commission to investigate into all that. They have produced a report which certainly is a report of first importance for the future of education in this country, and is a report that will require time to digest, time also, as the Commission itself is quite clear on the point, gradually to put into operation.   Our aim, at any rate, ought to be clear so far as these matters are concerned. 
     We have a system of compulsory attendance at national schools for what, roughly speaking, we might call primary education up to the age of 14. Whether the last two years' instruction in national schools should be considered primary education, may be open to some doubt.  Some people think that primary education should stop at 10, others at 12, but I think if you look at our national school programme you will see we have two modern languages, mathematics, not in the limited sense of arithmetic but in the widest sense, and in many of the schools we have also what is known as rural science. You will see that there will be enough, so to speak, for the pupils between the ages of 12 and 14 to bank on, and that there is no reason to fear that the complaint may be made which has been made even in neighbouring countries, that there was a tendency, owing to the same type of education being kept on between 12 and 14 as there had been up to 12, for the pupils going stale.  After 14 there should be continuation education for everybody.  That should be our aim.  It may be a secondary school up to the leaving certificate, or part-time education in the country districts. I should say that the economic conditions in country districts preclude anything else for a long time except part-time education, but you will find that that is so in most advanced countries in Europe.  The most they can aim at is part-time education.  We might possibly be able to introduce, especially for those who are not in employment, a system of compulsory whole-time education, for instance in the towns, that would bring the pupils up to 16 years of age.  Our aim then would be that those in the secondary schools could get full secondary education between the ages of 16 and 18, and that in the technical schools, taking technical education in the narrow sense of the phrase, should begin about the age of 16. 
     As we are on the subject, I do not think the country should be satisfied&mdash; it may take some years to realise it and it may mean an expenditure of money, and that expenditure of money and the financial condition of the country must   be borne in mind&mdash;until technical education in the widest sense, continuation and technical education, has got an acknowledged place in the educational system of the country.  That should be axiomatic to those who are interested in education, just as attendance at the primary schools is axiomatic up to the age of 14.  I might say that in some ways great liberty is now given in the programme in secondary schools.  They are not limited to any particular type of subject.  It might be possible and it would be desirable that some of the secondary schools should switch over to what some people would call&mdash;I just merely use this as a method of description and nothing else&mdash;a more practical type of education, possibly, in comparison with what is done in technical education. It is just possible that the other type of education, secondary education in the scholastic sense, has been overdone, and it would be no harm if some of the schools, even in the secondary system, would switch over in the other direction.  However, that is a matter for the schools themselves, and it is very difficult and it would not be right for the Minister or his Department to dictate in matters of that kind.  These are the principal matters with which I wish to deal so far as the policy of the Department is concerned.

Is maith an riail e sin ach nil fhios agam an bhfuil aon usaid a bhaint asti.  Do reir tuarasgabhala Choiste Kilannin, bhi na bainisteoiri i bhfabhar na scoileanna do cho-cheangailt.  Do bhi an Cardineil O Domhnaill agus Dean Maicin ar an gCoiste-sin.  Maidir leis na scoileanna fein, ta a lan acu go dona.  Nil in a lan acu ach bothain suaireacha agus iad salach.  Ta ceann acu sa nGaillimh&mdash;Crois-a-Mhama. Nuair a bhi lucht oibre ag deanamh an bhothair iarainn annsin, 33 bliain o shoin, thugadar £1 ar son an bhothain sin.  Scoil meascaithe isea e sin agus nil aon chloistin ann.  Ta a lan scoileanna eile ar nos sin&mdash;ceann i dTiobrad Arainn ar thaobh an bhothair&mdash; Holy Cross&mdash;gan aon chloistin ionnta. Is naireach an sgeal e sin.  D'fheadfainn samplai eile a thabhairt dibh ach is leor san is docha.  Nil fhios agam cen fath nach dtagann na hoifigi um shlainte phuibli anuas ortha. 
     Dubhairt an tAire gur beag airgead a caitheadh ar na tithe scoile o 1914 go dti 1922.  Samhluitear domh-sa gur bhain Rialtas Shasana deich milliun punt den oideachas in Eirinn idir 1903 agus 1922.  Ar aon chuma, fuaireamar £10,000,000 nios lugha na mar bhi ag dul duinn ach comortas a dheanamh le sceal na hAlban.  An raibh se sin sa chuntas nuair a rinneadh an socru deiridh le muinntir Shasana? 
     Bheireann an Rialtas airgead chun scoileanna do thogailt.  Ba choir don Rialtas feachaint chuige go mbeadh ainmnceacha na scoileanna so i nGaedhilg. Ni do liom go raghaidh na paisti amu toisc na hainmneacha a bheith i nGaedhilg.  Agus ni do liom go mbeadh aon leith-sgeal acu da dtiocfadh na-Gardai chuca. 
     Togadh scoil le deanai ag Lurga Breac in aice le Leitir Ceanainn agus is i mBearla ata an tainm.  Ta scoil eile i gContae B'Atha Cliath&mdash;St. John the Baptist a tugtar uirthi&mdash;in aice leis an gCarraig Dhuibh agus ta an sgeal mar an gceanna.  I Sligeach, ta scoileanna eile mar sin ag Cuil Mhaoile agus Kinna Grelly. 
     Maidir le gleas scoile do sholathar, bhi molta mar gheall ar sin ag an da   Chodhail Chlair ach nior dineadh aon ni.  Rud eile, ta na leabhair scoile rodhaor ar fad do na leanbhai bochta. Feach ar an liosta leabhar ata ag teastail o na leanbhai.  Ise an costas ata ar leabhair i gcoir rang a 3, na 5/7; rang a 4, 6/8; rang a 6, 14/3.  Ma ta cuigear leanbhai ag dul chun scoile&mdash;chun na scoile ceanna&mdash;ta £1-16-1 le n-ioc acu. Ta san ro-throm ar duine bocht. Fuaireas na leabhrai agus do dhineas amach an luach.  Ta dha leabhair agam annso&mdash;ceann acu leabhar ar Aireamh i nGaedhilg agus ceann eile ar Aireamh i mBearla.  Ta tri pighne mar chostas ar an leabhar ata i mBearla agus seacht bpighne ar an leabhar eile, gidh gur ionann iad.  Is do liom gur naireach an rud e sin agus go bhfuil eagcoir a dheanamh ag na clodoiri.  Ni ceart e a leigint leo mar sin.  Da gcuirfi sreath de leabhair saora amach i gcoir na mbun-scoileanna, ba mhaith an rud e agus bheadh tora maith as.  Deirtear nach ceart don Rialtas dul i gcomortas le daoine priomhaideacha ach ar cheist an oideachais is do liom gur ceart e agus iachall do chur ar na daoine eile leabhair nios fearr agus nios saoire do chur amach.  Do mhol Codhail Clar na mBun-Scol e seo agus nior dineadh aon ni mar gheall air. Is fior gur cuireadh amach sreath leabhar ach ni bhaineann siad ach le meadhon-scoileanna.  Ba mhaith an rud e do na leanbhai agus thabharfadh se congnamh do na muinteoiri da mbeadh leabharlanna scoile ann cho maith. 
     Maidir le pairceanna agus faithchi imeartha, ta siad ag teastail in a lan ait.  B'fheidir nach bhfuil an Roinn in ann an cheist sin do shocru go foill, ach nuair ata an talamh 'a roinnt ba cheart socru do dheanamh leis an Aire Tailte agus Talmhuiochta chun go mbeadh faithche imeartha ag na paisti scoile. 
     Do dhin an tAire tagairt do na scolleanna leanuinacha.  Ta gear-gha leo.  Dubhairt se go bhfeadfai an chuid is mo d'adhbhair muinteoiri d'fhail o na meadhon - scoileanna.  B'fheidir go bhfuil san ceart mar gan aon dabht ba choir do na muinteoiri oideachas maith do bheith aca.  Na daoine bochta nach bhfuil in acfuinn a leanbhai a chur ar meadhon-scoileanna, ta siad ag gearan &mdash;agus cuis ghearain aca&mdash;nach feidir leo a leanbhai a chur le muinteoireacht   toisc breis aiteanna do bheith da' gcur ar leith le haghaidh lucht na meadhonscol. Nil aon ais ag an duine bocht chun oiliunt fhonta do chur i n-airithe da chlainn.  B'fheidir go ndearfai go bhfuil scolaireachtai ann.  Is ar eigin is fiu tagairt doibh toisc a luighead i gcomortas leis an meid a bhionn a lorg, agus go minic is eagal liom nach iad clann na mbocht a gheibheann iad. Rud eile dhe, ni bhionn ag na Comhairli Contae aon scolaireachtai le haghaidh na gColaisti Muinteoireachta &mdash;rud aimideach&mdash;mar d'fhanfhadh na scolairi san in Eirinn.  Tugtar scolaireachtai fe lathair i gcoir na h-Iolscoileanna agus scoileanna eile agus i bhfurmhor na gcursai ni bhionn aon tairbhe as an oideachas so don tir seo.  Imthionn na mic-leighinn thar saile.  Da dtabharfai na scolaireachtai do sna Colaisti Muinteoireachta d'fhanfadh na muinteoiri in Eirinn, agus tiochfadh tairbhe don tir as.  Do dineadh tagairt do Scoil Bhrighde, Scoil Mhuire, etc.  Ach, ca leanfar den oideachas san? 
     Mar gheall ar na Colasti Ullmhuchain, is maith an rud go bhfuilid ann, ach, ba mhaith liom a fhios a bheith agam ce mheid paisti on nGaeltacht ata ionta.  Dubhairt duine liom, agus bhi eolas maith aige, na raibh as an nGaeltacht ionta ach deichniur fen gcead.  Rud eile nach bhfuilim sasta mar gheall air, se sin nach fuil na mic-leighinn ag dul i measc na nGaelgeoiri&mdash;go mor-mor na sean-Ghaelgeoiri.  Bheadh se cho maith na Colaisti do chur ar bun sa Ghalltacht. Caithfear usaid do bhaint as na Gaelgeoiri, go mor-mor na sean-Ghaelgeoiri. 
     Ta athas orm a chloisint go bhfuil an tAire chun colaiste nua muinteoireachta do chur ar bun.  Is trua nuair a bhi seans ag an Aire roinnt blian o shoin colaiste d'fhail agus do Shaolu, chun dea-shompla do thabhairt do na colaisti eile, nar dhin se e.  Ta colaisti muinteoireachta&mdash;agus ni ga iad do luadh&mdash;agus se mo thuairim nach feidir iad do Ghaolu, muna ndintear brostu, roimh fhiche bliain. 
     Mar gheall ar na Cursai Samhraidh, deirtear nach mbionn an scrudu i gcoir an Ard-teastais ar aon dul leis an gclar leabhar agus eile agus gur   mor an deifriocht a bhionn idir an scrudu beil i gColaiste amhain agus i gColaiste eile.  Dubhradh liom gur cuireadh ceist mar so in aon scrudu amhain &ldquo;Cuir filiocht Cheitinn agus Dhonnchad Rua Mhic Chonnmara i gcomparaid agus tabhair duinn cupla samplai d'fhiliocht na beirte seo.&rdquo; In ait eile, se an cheist do bhi ann na &ldquo;Conus a thaithnigheann an ait seo leat?&rdquo; Ba choir don Roinn dul i gcomhairle leis na hollamhain uile, ni hamhain i mBaile Atha Cliath ach fen dtuaith chun an standard do shocru. Ni ceart do na cigiri fiafrai des na hiarrthoiri cad as doibh.  Is do liom go bhfuil reasun airithe fa sin agus go bhfuil cuigeachas ag baint leis agus ni ceart san. 
     Is maith an rud go bhfuil aire a thabhairt do scrudu beil 'sna bun-scoileanna ach is eigean leanuint den obair sin.  Cuir i gcas&mdash;ins an scrudu don rang is isle sa Stat-Sheirbhis nil don scrudu beil agus teidheann a lan paisti as na bun-scoileanna isteach ar an scrudu san. 
     
      
       Cade an scrudu e san? 
     
     
      
       Junior clerkships, is do liom. 
     
     
      
       Ta scrudu beil ann anois le haghaidh an ranga san. 
     
     
      
       Ta athas orm san a chloisint mar sli maith isea e chun cuidiu le labhairt na Gaedhilge ins na scoileanna e a bheith riachtanach i scruduithe na Stat-Sheirbhise. Maidir leis an Ollscoil, ba cheart baint eigin a bheith ag na Colaisti Muinteoireachta leis an Ollscoil agus seans a thabhairt do na muinteoiri ceim Ollscoile d'fhail i gCorcaigh, i mBaile Atha Cliath no sa nGaillimh.  I mBeal Feirste ta seans nios fearr ag na muinteoiri ceim d'fhail ag an Ollscoil annsan na mar ta ag na muinteoiri anso ceim d'fhail ag an Ollscoil Naisiunta.  Ba mhaith liom a ra gur b'e mo thuairim, agus mo thuairim laidir, nach ceart a bheith ag iarraidh ar mhuinteoiri ata ar bheagan Gaedhilge abhair eile do mhuine tre Ghaedhilg.  Is do liom na dineann san aon mhaitheas don Ghaedhilg na don oideachas; agus   gur eageoir ar leanbhai e.  Is ceart na muinteoiri d'ullmhu i dtreo is go mbeidh siad i n-ann a geuid oibre do dheanamh tre Ghaedhilg.  Ach ni ceart a bheith ag iarraidh ar dhuine leabhar do leigheamh istoiche agus foclai do chuartu san bhfocloir i dtreo go mbeidh siad abalta e do mhuine an mhaidean 'na dhiaidh sin.  Nil aon mhaitheas ina leitheid san d'oideachas. 
       Mar gheall ar chigiri, se mo thuairim go mba cheart cuid aca do thogha o n-a muinteoiri ins na bun-scoileanna i dtreo go mbeadh taithi aca ar an obair. Ni abraim gur ceart iad go leir d'fhail mar sin ach cuid aca ach go hairithe. 
       Mar gheall ar chearclan ar chigircacht, nil na m1⁄2inteori go leir sasta leis. Nil a fhios agam an maith an plean ata ann idtaobh na scruduithe ach is maith an scealai an aimsir. 
       Ar an gceist, teisteas no teistimeireacht do thabhairt do 'na leanbhai ar fhagaint scoile dhoibh, nil an sceim i bhfeidhm fos.  Dheanfadh se iad do bhrostu ach ba choir deifriocht do dheanamh idir cathair agus tuaith, idir aiteanna ar nos Bhaile Atha Cliath agus Corcaigh, agus eile, agus aiteanna fe'n dtuaith, agus idir scoil mhor agus scoil bhig.  Nior cheart an standard ceanna a bheith aca ins an da ait. 
       Anois, ta cupla focal le ra agam ar Chomhairle an Oideachais.  Nil aon chaoi ag an Aire ar eolas d'fhail ach tre chigiri.  Ba cheart gleas a cheapa a bhearfadh caoi do thuismitheoiri bainisteoiri agus muinteoiri a dtuairimi a chur os coir na hAireachta.  Se an gleas is fearr chuige sin na an Chomhairle sheasta um Oideachas a bhunu. Fe'n gcead Dail bhi a leitheid de sceim i bhfeidhm.  Ta na muinteoiri ar lorg sceime mar sin agus moltar ins an leabhar &ldquo;Labour Policy on Education&rdquo; e.  Taim ar aon intinn leo, annsin.  Bionn dha innsint ar gach sceal agus is fusa a fheiceail conus mar ta an sceal ma ta Codhail ann ar a bhfuil teachtai o na bainisteoiri, na muinteoiri agus an Aireacht. 
     
     Mar gheall ar na muinteoiri d'oiliuint, ta an sceim ana-chostasach. Caitheann na muinteoiri seacht mi sa bhliain i gcolaiste.  Iocann an Stat £88 i gcoir gach fir agus £75 i gcoir gach cailin.  Iocann se £5,000 i bhfuirm bonus, £2,000 i gcoir tigheas agus £302   mar chios talmhan.  Ins na Meastachain i gcoir 1928-29, chitear go bhfuil san iomlan £7,302.  In a theanta san, iocann gach macleigheann £22 10s. 0d. sa bhliain.  Gheibheann na colaisti £118 an fear agus £106 an cailin sa bhliain.  Bheadh se nios saoire iad do chur go dti an Ollscoil go cean bliana. Rud eile, ta costas ar na macaibh leighinn mar gheall ar leabhair, airgead poca agus eile agus caithfidh siad iad fein a chothu sa bhaile ar feadh cuig mhi sa mbliain.  Ta £22 10s. ro-dhian ar na bochtaibh.  An bhfeadfai e laghdu agus bliain san Ollscoil do thabhairt doibh fe mar a moladh ag an da Chodhail Chlair? 
     Is d'aos na n-Ollscoil a dintear cigire agus ma ta siad ar lorg muinteora le haghaidh modh-scoile teastuionn ceim ollscoile uatha.  Ma tathar ar lorg san, is coir seans a thabhairt do na muinteoiri ceimeanna d'fhail.  Pe sceal e, is maith an rud an t-oideachas is fearr a thabhairt d'oidi scoile.  Sin adubhradh nuair a bhiothas ar lorg Ollscoile naisiunta. 
     Nil fhios agam an bhfuil cead agam   tagairt do dheanamh do' sceal na Scoileanna Ceartuchain agus Saothair? 
     
      
       An bhfuil se ins na Votai eile?  Ma ta aon bhaint aige le polaisi an Aire ta cead agat tracht air. 
     
     
      
       Is do liom go bhfuil baint aige leis an bpolaisi.  Ins na 60 Scoileanna Ceartuchain agus Saothair, ta 120 muinteoiri tuatha ag obair.  Muinteoiri maithe isea iad.  Ta clar na mbun-scoil i bhfeidhm ins na scoileanna seo. Teigheann na cigiri on Aireacht isteach ins na scoileanna.  Ach nil aon bhuanthuarastal, pinsean na eile ag na muinteoiri seo agus is naireach an sceal e sin. 
       Anois tairgim go gcuirtear an diospoireacht ar ath-lo. 
       Debate adjourned until Wednesday. 
       The Dail adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until Friday at 10.30 a.m. 
     
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWER. - DIVISION OF KILDARE ESTATES. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state when the lands containing 402 acres statute, in the townlands of Ballymore-Eustace East, Broadleas Commons, Horsepasstown, Kilmalum, and Silverhill Lower, on the estate of Captain Edward Hornidge, and other lands recently acquired by the Land Commission in the neighbourhood of Ballymore-Eustace, County Kildare, will be divided amongst the congest applicants (about 100 in number) whose names have been furnished to the Land Commission. 
     
     
      
       Proceedings are pending under the provisions of Section 24 (1) of Land Act, 1923, for the acquisition of certain lands in the townlands of Broadleas Commons, Horsepasstown, Kilmalum and Silverhill Lower, containing approximately 303 acres, in the estate of Captain Edward Hornidge, but the Land Commission are not yet in a position to state when the lands will be acquired.  The lands of Bishopslands, containing 513 acres, the property of Deputy George Wolfe, was vested in the Land Commission on 2nd April last.  The division of these lands will be carried out as expeditiously as possible, but it is not possible at present to state when the lands will be distributed.
