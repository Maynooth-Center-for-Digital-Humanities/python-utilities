     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - TOWN TENANTS COMMISSION. 
     
      
       asked the President whether the Government have decided what proposals for legislation are necessary to give effect to the recommendations contained in the Report of the Town Tenants Commission; and whether he will state the intentions of the Government with reference to the Report. 
     
     
      
       No decision has yet been reached as to the precise nature of the legislation which will be promoted by the Government to deal with town tenancies.  It is the definite intention of the Government to introduce legislation of this kind, but I cannot at this stage indicate when the appropriate Bill is likely to be ready. 
     
     
      
       Will the President say whether anything can be done to prevent owners of small shops taking steps at the moment to evict their tenants so that they will not get the advantages of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Town Tenants Commission? I could give the President particulars of numerous such cases. 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy communicates with me I will endeavour to answer him. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEMES. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the large amount of unemployment and consequent poverty and suffering existing throughout the Saorstat, he will introduce a Supplementary Estimate prior to the adjournment of the Dail for the summer recess, to provide the necessary funds to finance schemes for the   relief of unemployment, so that work may be provided for those unemployed. 
     
     
      
       It is not proposed to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for Relief Schemes prior to the adjournment of the Dail for the summer recess. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister aware that at present there are tens of thousands of men and women unemployed? In view of the fact that the Dail will shortly adjourn, approximately for about three months, I submit that the reply of the Minister displays a colossal amount of callous indifference with the plight of the unemployed.  I therefore propose to raise the matter on the Adjournment. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - OLD AGE PENSIONS CLAIM (DONEGAL). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state why the increase of one shilling in the old age pension has not been granted to Mrs. Annie Gillespie, Kinnakillew, Glencolumbkille, County Donegal. 
     
     
      
       An application for increased pension was received in this case but the Pension Officer was not satisfied that the pensioner was entitled to the increase as her means in his opinion exceeded the statutory limit. The pensioner was duly informed of the Pension Officer's ruling and did not appeal against such ruling to the Pension Committee. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state why the increase of one shilling in the old age pension has not been granted to Mrs. Madge McGrory, Magheraban, Linsfort, Buncrana, County Donegal. 
     
     
      
       Mrs. McGrory's old age pension has been increased to the 10s. rate under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1928, with effect as from 4th May, 1928. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state why the increase of one shilling in the old age pension has not been   granted to Mr. Owen Hagan, Tonduff, Linsfort, Bunerana, County Donegal. 
     
     
      
       Mr. Hagan's old age pension has been increased to the 10s. rate under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1928, with effect as from 4th May, 1928. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - SELECTION OF SCHOOL INSPECTORS. 
     D'fhiafruigh 
     
      
       den Aire Oideachais cionnus a toghtar cigiri scoile (i gcoir na mbunscol); an bhfuil buan-choiste ann chuige sin; cia hiad comhaltai an choiste is deunaighe a dhin cigiri do thoghadh; agus an mbionn aoinne ar an gcoiste toghtha a bhi ina oide scoile. 
     
     
      
       When the sanction of the Minister for Finance for the filling of vacancies has been obtained the matter is referred in the ordinary course to the Civil Service Commissioners. They issue advertisements and take such other steps as they consider necessary&mdash;in the present case including, I understand, the setting up of a Selection Board.  Finally, they recommend candidates to the Minister for Education for appointment.  I am not in a position to give information about the details of the procedure adopted by the Civil Service Commissioners. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps the Minister would inform us whether it was customary that, at least, one person who had been at some period a National Teacher should be on the Selection Board, and would he also inform us when that custom was abandoned and why? 
     
     
      
       I do not know the details as to how the Civil Service Commissioners appoint the Board.  In this case I do not know who were actually on the Board. 
     
     
      
       I conclude from the Minister's reply that it is the Civil Service Commissioners who make the selection. 
     
     
      
       If the appointment of a Selection Board is   necessary it is the Civil Service Commissioners who appoint that Board. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - COOLE RIVER WIDENING. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the work of deepening and widening the Coole River in connection with the Shannon Electricity Scheme has now been finished. 
     
     
      
       It is understood that the question refers to the Kilmastulla River, over which Coole Bridge passes.  The Shannon works necessitate a diversion of the river, which is approaching completion.  The greater part of the excavation is finished, and it is expected that the river can be diverted in a few weeks from now. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - SHANNON SCHEME AND FLOODED LANDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has yet received the report of the valuer who examined claims for compensation arising out of alleged additional flooding caused by the Shannon works at Birdhill, Pollock, County Tipperary; and whether he will state the reason for the delay in paying compensation to the farmers in this area, whose lands are alleged to have been damaged by such flooding. 
     
     
      
       The valuer is at present completing investigations on my behalf into the claims for compensation for damage alleged to be due to flooding of the lands at Pollagh by reason of the Shannon works, and I expect to have his report submitted for my consideration in the course of next week.  No avoidable delay has occurred in the matter, but many of the claims for compensation made in connection with the Shannon works have proved difficult and laborious to deal with. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - SALE OF GALWAY LANDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state if the Mount Talbot House and lands attached have been sold to Mr. Kelly,   of Ballygar, County Galway; if so, when the property was sold; and whether he will state the price paid by Mr. Kelly. 
     
     
      
       The mansion house and lands were advertised for sale in December, 1924, by tender, and the offers received were absolutely inadequate.  They were subsequently sold to Mr. Michael Kelly for the sum of £1,300. 
     
     
      
       Would the Parliamentary Secretary state the amount of the highest tender sent in? 
     
     
      
       Thirteen hundred pounds. 
     
     
      
       The people of the district do not believe that it was.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the fact that Mr. Kelly was the auctioneer of the lands and that as he is supposed to have a pull with Mr. Hogan or somebody else he got first preference? 
     
     
      
       The mansion house and lands were advertised in the ordinary way.  Notices of the sale were published in the local papers, and it was open to anyone to make an offer.  An offer of £1,300 was made openly by Mr. Kelly and, being the highest offer, it was naturally accepted. 
     
     
      
       Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is great discontent in the Mount Talbot district over this matter, and that the people actually on the land were not provided for?  Some provision should have been made for people who had a claim to the land.  It is believed, as Deputy Killilea has stated, that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture had something to do with the matter. 
     
     
      
       The Minister for Lands and Agriculture had absolutely nothing to do with it, nor was there any influence brought to bear on the Land Commission in connection with the sale of the house and lands.  It should be clear to the Deputy that it would be very difficult to sell the mansion house unless some land was attached to it. 
     
     
     
      
       The gardener could, at least, have been provided for. He should have got some allotment. 
     
     
      
       Does the Parliamentary Secretary believe that £1,300 would pay for the timber on the land, or that the house itself is valued only for £1,300? 
     
     
      
       It was open competition. 
     
     
      
       Open competition behind the backs of the people. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - LAND DISTRIBUTION IN CO. MEATH. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he can state why the claim of Nicholas Geraghty, Lobinstown, County Meath, for a portion of the lands known as the Reynell Estate, County Meath, was disallowed; and whether the Minister will take steps to have this decision reconsidered. 
     
     
      
       The lands referred to, comprising 144a., 2r. 33p., situate in the townlands of Killary and Lobinstown, County Meath, were acquired by the Land Commission under Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923.  They were allotted to ten allottees; eight of these were tenants of small holdings, and one a man living in a labourer's cottage beside the Killary lands, who had managed, on behalf of the Irish Transport Union, the property before it had been taken over by the Land Commission, and one to the County Meath Board of Health to provide a cow-plot for the agricultural labourers in the vicinity.  It was found impossible to include any more purchasers in the scheme owing to the limited area of the lands. 
     
   
   
     PRIVATE NOTICE QUESTION. - SEARCH BY GARDA. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice whether Mr. Peadar O'Donnell's office at 39 Marlborough Road was raided and searched by members of the Garda Siochana on yesterday, Wednesday, July 4th; if so, what was the object of the raid and whether anything incriminating was found as a result of the search. 
     
     
      
       The premises, No. 39 Marlborough Road, Donnybrook, were searched yesterday by members of the Garda Siochana under the authority of a search warrant granted by a Justice of the District Court under the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925.  The object of the search was to obtain treasonable documents suspected to be in the premises.  The search proved nugatory. 
     
     
      
       In view of the fact that Mr. O'Donnell has now been arrested and searched fourteen times within the last few weeks, and that the further search which has taken place since the matter was raised here has also proved fruitless, can the Minister give an undertaking that the campaign against Mr. O'Donnell will stop? 
     
     
      
       The Guards have to do their duty and will continue to do their duty. 
     
     
      
       Is this a variation of the system by which people have been kept in prison without trial for seven or eight months, and then when   they are brought to trial they are found not guilty?  Is this another way of getting their own back? 
     
     
      
       Will the Deputy mention any persons who were kept in prison for eight months without trial? 
     
     
      
       That is another question. 
     
     
      
       I will give a whole string of them. 
     
     
      
       I would like to ask the Minister if he is aware that the manager of a newspaper, which is turned out on these premises, was prevented from going into his office during the course of the raid, and if it is also a fact that a member of the Gardai went to the telephone and represented himself to one caller as a member of the staff of the newspaper? 
     
     
      
       I have no information as to that. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister make inquiries? 
     
     
      
       I can make inquiries, but the matter does not arise out of this question.  I have no notice of that. 
     
     
      
       The Minister is aware that Mr. O'Donnell has been arrested twelve or fourteen times within the last month.  Was he arrested for the purpose of getting incriminating evidence on him in the nature of incriminating documents? 
     
     
      
       That matter was very fully discussed on the adjournment the other day. 
     
     
      
       And was most unsatisfactorily answered. 
     
     
      
       I put down that question, but I was not here to ask it.  Was it the purpose in getting Mr. O'Donnell arrested to have him searched? 
     
     
      
       Mr. O'Donnell was searched for incriminating documents.  I am sure Deputy Boland will give Deputy Aiken full information as to what happened on the adjournment debate. 
     
     
     
      
       Will the Minister give me the information&mdash;was that the purpose of arresting him? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       If he was arrested each time in order to get something incriminating on him why was he not arrested and searched on the day he was released, last Wednesday?  If he was arrested in order to be searched, why was he not searched? 
     
     
      
       I understood he was searched. 
     
     
      
       He was not searched. 
     
     
      
       If I am not mistaken, one of the Deputy's charges was that he was searched. 
     
     
      
       Yes, but he was not searched on that occasion.  The Minister said that he was always arrested in order to be searched.  If that was the purpose of arresting him why was he not searched? 
     
     
      
       This is a question of a raid on the premises yesterday.  It is a different question to the other altogether. 
     
     
      
       I would like if the Minister would give us some assurance that these obviously groundless raids will cease and that there will be no interference with this man in the course of his business in future unless there is substantial reason to justify it. We have had a series of these raids on Mr. O'Donnell.  In each case the raid proved fruitless and yet the raids are being continued.  I would like if the Minister would give us an assurance that this practice will stop. 
     
     
      
       If the Guards have reasonable suspicion and think that there are incriminating documents on Mr. O'Donnell it will be the duty of the Guards to search him. 
     
     
      
       May I ask the Minister whether he does not think that a man who has been searched fourteen times is unlikely to have any incriminating documents on him?  Is it not obvious that it is a case of continuous persecution? 
     
     
     
      
       Nothing else. 
     
     
      
       He has always opportunities of getting rid of these documents. 
     
   
   
     QUESTION ON ADJOURNMENT. 
     
      
       With regard to the adjournment, Deputy Byrne gave notice that he would raise a particular matter on the adjournment last evening but he asked to have it postponed until this evening.  Deputy Cassidy has also given notice of raising a matter arising out of question 2 on to-day's Order Paper.  I wonder could there be any arrangement made? 
     
     
      
       As both matters appear to hinge together, if I could get five minutes it would do me, and Deputy Cassidy could follow, or if he went first, I could, with your permission, follow him. 
     
     
      
       We will take Deputy Cassidy's notice as the wider one. 
     
   
   
     ORDER OF BUSINESS. 
     
      
       Might I ask the Minister for Agriculture, who was so anxious about the Agricultural Credit Bill last night, whether he will be prepared to take it before the Constitution Bills? 
     
     
      
       His anxiety is still unabated. 
     
     
      
       In Private Members' time. 
     
     
      
       When is it proposed to take the Vote on Account? 
     
     
      
       I propose to take it next week. 
     
   
   
     PROPOSED NEW STANDING ORDER. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       That the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be instructed to draw up for the consideration of the Dail a Standing Order or Standing Orders, dealing specifically with Deputies who bring the House into contempt by disorderly conduct towards the Chair. 
     
     The Standing Orders as at present   framed make provision for dealing with disorderly conduct on the part of a Deputy towards another Deputy, but do not specifically provide for disorderly conduct towards the occupant of the Chair.  That such a contingency might arise was considered by the Committee who framed the Standing Orders, but the conclusion come to then was that it was undesirable to include in the Standing Orders an Order dealing specifically with the matter unless and until necessity for such an Order arose.  Consequently, as the Standing Orders are now drafted, the offence of disorderly conduct towards the Chair is from the point of view of disciplinary consequences on the same footing as that of disorderly conduct towards an ordinary Deputy.  That in effect means that when a Deputy has been suspended on the first occasion the period of suspension is a week, on the second occasion a fortnight, and on a third or subsequent occasion one month. 
     I am of opinion, and it is an opinion which should commend itself to the House as a whole that these disciplinary consequences are totally inadequate to meet the offence of disorderly conduct towards the Chair, which in essence is contempt of the House itself. As to what the procedure should be, that question is one for consideration in the first instance by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and for determination ultimately by the House itself when the report of that Committee has been tabled. 
     It has always been the considered view of this House that the Chair must be protected in the discharge of its functions from innuendo, insinuation, or direct personal abuse.  Failing acceptance of the position that the Chair in any House&mdash;whether the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or any other presiding Deputy must not be attacked for the way in which he discharges his functions save by the method which has been indicated to the House already, no other course than that suggested in the motion appears practicable if the fundamental basis on which the business of the House has always been transacted is to be preserved. 
     
     
      
       Is this motion in order?  Yesterday was the first notice we got of it, when it was down on the Order Paper for the first time. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is objecting on the ground of notice? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       The motion is one concerning the business of the House and for the reference of certain matters to a Standing Committee of the House.  There is an option in the Chair to take a motion without the four days' notice required ordinarily by the Standing Orders, and this is the kind of motion which I think might be so taken, unless agreement can be reached to take it on another day.  I think a motion dealing with the business of the House, referring a matter such as this to a Standing Committee of the House, might be taken without the ordinary notice. 
     
     
      
       Is it an urgent matter?  Is it not possible to leave that matter lie over until amendments could be tabled.  For instance, we are of opinion that the whole question of the Chair might be dealt with at the same time. 
     
     
      
       I submit, on a point of order, that in accepting this motion now, at a time when the House has not had time to formulate in an orderly and legal manner, according to the Standing Orders, an amendment thereto, you are deliberately invading the liberties and the rights of the ordinary members of this House. 
     
     
      
       &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       That is not a point of order.  It is a grossly disorderly statement, and the Deputy ought to withdraw it at once. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy will not withdraw. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy has made a statement which he refuses to withdraw.  I leave his conduct to be judged by the House. 
     
     
     
      
       I move that Deputy Flinn be suspended from the service of the House. 
     
     
      
       I have great pleasure in seconding. 
     
     
     
      
       I second the motion. 
       Question put: &ldquo;That Deputy Flinn be suspended from the service of the Dail.&rdquo;

        Question declared carried. 
     
      
       I therefore direct Deputy Flinn, in pursuance of the decision of the Dail, to withdraw. 
       
         Deputy Flinn then withdrew from the Dail. 
       
     
     
      
       On a point of information: is it a matter of disorder meriting suspension for a Deputy to state that the action of the Chair was an infringement of the liberty of members? 
     
     
      
       Yes, but that was not the statement made. We cannot go back on that particular incident.  But a statement that the Chair is, in fact, infringing the liberties of members is disorderly, because the action of the Chair cannot be criticised in what you might call a casual way, but only in a definite fashion. The statement made was altogether different. 
     
     
      
       Surely it must be in order to point out that the Chair is not infallible.  Surely it ought to be permissible to point out where the action of the Chair would, in fact, be infringing on private members' liberties? 
     
     
      
       Is not the gravity of the offence in this case the fact that Deputy Flinn refused to withdraw on being asked to withdraw a statement which the Chair said was disorderly? 
     
     
      
       The statement was: &ldquo;In accepting this motion now you are deliberately infringing the liberties of private members.&rdquo; There was no &ldquo;if&rdquo; and no point of order.  I had not yet concluded on the point of order raised by Deputy de Valera.  The statement was not a point of order at all.  It was a deliberate accusation against the Chair. As to Deputy de Valera's point, it might be well if the position of the Chair were made perfectly clear on the question of infallibility.  If the House will allow me, I should like to make a statement to the House on that, if it is desirable. 
     
     
      
       I think it is. 
     
     
     
      
       The Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle are appointed by the Dail to be the servants of the Dail and to perform certain functions placed upon them by the practice of the House and by Standing Orders.  They have, in the exercise of their functions, to exercise their own best judgment.  They have frequently to decide matters, difficult and intricate matters, after due consideration.  They have also frequently to resolve without any notice, and sometimes in very difficult circumstances, questions which call for swift and immediate decision, and these decisions by the occupant of the Chair, whoever he may be, whether the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, or the presiding Deputy, have to be given to the best of his judgment in the particular circumstances and when given to be accepted.  Clearly there is the possibility of error and that possibility is not denied, nor even the probability of error in certain cases; and no claim on behalf of the Chair has ever been made or is being made to infallibility.  Such a claim would be impossible for any ordinary human person to make.  But the situation is, that the decision of the Chair having been given, it must be accepted, and if it is to be questioned, it must only be questioned on motion.  This is not a question of personalities, nor a question of this House as at present constituted; it is a question of the Chairman in any Dail, no matter how constituted politically, and no matter under what fundamental law it might have to work.  The position of the Chair would be the same in substance.  No claim can be made to infallibility.  But this claim can be made: That the Chair should not be subjected to accusations and to criticism except on motion.  The functions that the Chair has to carry out are of a difficult nature and the occupant of the Chair must not be criticised except in one particular way.  That perhaps is the whole difficulty. 
     
     And, as the occupant of the Chair, I might go one step further.  Provision is directly made in the Standing Orders for the removal of the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It has been stated by responsible Deputies in   the House that they intend, quite presumably their Party intends, to take steps for the removal of the present Ceann Comhairle.  If I may be permitted to introduce a personal note into the matter for one moment I would say that the Ceann Comhairle is not unprepared to make way at any time for a successor who may be appointed by this House or by any succeeding House.  In this matter, it is well for Deputies to know that just as no claim is made to infallibility so no claim is made to permanency. It has been my considered view, and I have given it on many occasions to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and to the leaders of different Parties in this House, that in a Parliamentary assembly it would be impossible and undesirable to impose on any House any particular individual as its Chairman; that each House must be free to choose its own Chairman. For that reason, I am not unprepared to make way here or in any other Dail for a successor, but I am unwilling to allow to be created here precedents and practices which would make it impossible for any successor to do successfully the work which has to be done here. That is my main concern in the whole matter.  The position of the Ceann Comhairle, the position of the Chair, whoever may occupy it, should not be made impossible and it will be made impossible if the Chair is to be subjected to the same kind of criticism as, for example, a Minister of any Government is subjected to.  I am prepared to give any further information to Deputies who may desire it and I hope that I have sufficiently explained any question relating to infallibility or permanency. 
     
      
       As regards the question of infallibility, the idea I had in mind when I used that word is this: the Ceann Comhairle, as you have indicated, has to come to certain decisions, and it is only right that a certain aspect of the matter which may not have occurred to him should be put before him.  It seems to me that in the case of Deputy Flinn, he was bringing before you a certain aspect of the situation which might not have occurred to yourself. That was, that in accepting this   without the usual notice, the justification being that it was a matter concerning the dignity of the House and that notice should be dispensed with, in his opinion you were infringing on the rights of private Deputies.  I submit that he had a right to bring that particular aspect of the situation before your notice.  I do not think he had any other purpose. 
     
     
      
       If the point of order were put to me in the same manner as Deputy de Valera has put it to me, then it would be properly put, namely, that if the motion were accepted to-day it would be impossible to put in an amendment.  I heard that same point of order here before at some length with regard to another motion and another matter.  A point of order is in essence a submission of certain facts or considerations with a view to influencing a decision which has not yet been given, but which, when given, will be accepted.  That was quite different from the form in which Deputy Flinn put his point.  What was said then was that in accepting this motion the Chair was deliberately infringing the rights of private Deputies.  That is a plain accusation against the Chair, and there is no liberty in the House to make that kind of accusation except on a motion. I think Deputy de Valera will agree that it would be impossible to carry out the functions of the Chair if such statements could be made in the House. It is not, perhaps, correct that we should go back on all these proceedings, but if it serves the purpose of making the position of the Chair clear, then a good purpose will have been served.  A point of order may be put, but that point of order cannot be one which includes an accusation of deliberate bias. 
     
     
      
       There is a feeling, without doubt in our Party that the rulings of the Chair were not impartial. We might as well be quite frank on this matter.  That feeling is certainly existing among members of our Party. They have a number of instances before their own minds, and they feel that decisions given by the Chair would not, for example, be given if the occupant of the Chair were a member of another Party.  That is the feeling, and I am   simply expressing a feeling that is quite common among the members of our Party.  We are quite aware that there is a majority in this House, and that if we bring a definite motion calling attention to these particular incidents, and if we have the matter debated, the majority would vote against any motion of the kind. 
     
     
      
       A majority, the Deputy will agree, of more than one Party. 
     
     
      
       I do not know whether it would be a constant majority or whether it would vary. 
     
     
      
       Test it. 
     
     
      
       Order! The Deputy is not quite within his rights in making any accusation against the Chair, but at the same time, because of the circumstances, I am prepared to hear the Deputy. 
     
     
      
       I say the difficulty that the Chair is in is due to the fact that there is a feeling among members of our Party that the decisions which have been given in some cases recently would not be given were the occupant of the Chair not a member of Cumann na nGaedheal. 
     
     
      
       The occupant of the Chair is not, in fact, a member of Cumann na nGaedheal. 
     
     
      
       Was. 
     
     
      
       The occupant of the Chair&mdash;and, as I say, this applies to every kind of Dail that you can imagine, and it applies to this kind of a House, no matter under what fundamental law it works&mdash;must first get elected to the House.  He must then be elected by the members of the House to the Chair either by unanimous vote or by a majority vote, because, in the ultimate resort, everything must be decided by a majority vote.  Coming to the House by way of election, he must presumably in most cases come in on a particular platform.  He then gets certain duties to perform which require that he should exercise certain qualities.  It is not being done at the moment in that particular way.  It is   manifestly not competent continually to charge the occupant of the Chair with being a member of the Party through which he first secured election to the House.  As a matter of fact, the Ceann Comhairle is not a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and has not been since his election to this Chair in 1923&mdash;a long time ago. 
     
     
      
       You are an honour to the Chair, sir. 
     
     
      
       It is perhaps better that this thing should be talked about here than having it in the air. Having it mentioned here will save a good deal of talk afterwards.  As I have said, the feeling was strong amongst members of our Party that there were decisions given by the Chair which could not be regarded as impartial decisions.  That is a fact.  I am simply stating a fact about the feeling that exists.  I quite understand the difficulty of the Chair.  The Chair undoubtedly has a difficult task to perform here, and as the Ceann Comhairle himself has pointed out his position&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       You did not appreciate it. 
     
     
      
       The Ceann Comhairle will originally have come to the Chair as being a member of one Party or another, and the attitude that we ought to expect from the Chair is impartiality in his judgment &mdash;that when he is in the Chair he will act impartially and act in accordance with the Standing Orders, forgetting, if it is possible for him to forget, that he is a member of one Party rather than of another.  We, at the time the question of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was being considered, put up a proposition to the effect that it should be frankly recognised that the occupant of the Chair was originally a member of a Party, and that he should be allowed to vote with the Party, and that his conduct in the Chair could be as impartial at the same time without any attempt whatever to gloss over the fact that he was a member of a Party.  That is our attitude towards him.  If I might deal with the other   question raised&mdash;the motion of the President&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       The Deputy was dealing with the question of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Ceann Comhairle is making no ad misericordiam appeal to this House to consider the difficulties of the position.  The difficulties of the position, while I appreciate them fully, are not pressing me down in any sense.  But there is no doubt there are two different things at issue in what Deputy de Valera has said; one is that the judgment exercised by the Chair and the judgment of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle have been challenged from time to time.  But it is one thing to make an error of judgment to which we are all liable.  It is another thing constantly to err owing to evil motives. Now if evil motives have been ascribed that is a very different thing.  Let me say one other thing now.  It has been frequently said here that the Standing Orders are for the protection of minorities.  That is only a partial truth.  The Standing Orders do afford and ought to afford certain protection to the minority, but the main purpose of the Standing Orders is to assist in the transaction of the business of the House. 
     
     If the Standing Orders do contain safeguards for the minority in certain directions they must ensure that the rights of the majority will also be preserved. What has really to be recognised is&mdash;what is fundamental to the whole thing here&mdash;that the decision of the House itself is all important.  For example, when the House decides the motion, &ldquo;that the question be now put,&rdquo; in the affirmative, it is the decision of the House that prevents Deputies from continuing and having any further debate, and not the decision of the Chair.  And in the ultimate there can be no other decision than the decision of the House.  The position of the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when appointed by the House is that they must do their best according to their own lights to perform the duties of the office in accordance with the Standing Orders.  Their actions can only be   criticised through motions made in the House because it is the House, and the House only, that the occupants of the Chair are responsible to.  It is in the House they should be criticised, and it is only in the House opportunity for reply exists as far as the occupants of the Chair are concerned. 
     
      
       I just wish to say a word on this matter.  I do not wish to refer in any way to the statement made by the Ceann Comhairle, because I think it must be generally admitted that what he has stated must be accepted by everybody who wishes to take part in a deliberative assembly of this kind.  That is, that the Chair must be given a certain authority and must exercise that authority to the best of its judgment, and that there must be a way, and that there is a way for dealing with the Chair if, in the opinion of the House, the Chair is not doing its duty properly.  I do wish to refer to the feeling which Deputy de Valera states exists amongst certain members of his Party with regard to the decisions of the Chair, that these decisions were not impartial.  The Deputy says that that feeling is there. But I am inclined to think that that feeling arises through inexperience, inexperience on the part of those Deputies, of Parliamentary procedure.  Perhaps when those Deputies are longer in the House they will see, I believe, that that feeling will disappear.  I speak as one who was a member of a small Party in this House since 1922. Members who were in that Parliament of 1922 will remember that the leader of the Labour Party at that time, Mr. Johnson, was a man who, on more occasions than any other Deputy in the House, raised points of order and challenged the decision of the Chair. He always challenged them in an argumentative way.  He submitted his point and when the Chair ruled against him he accepted without question the decision of the Chair.  There were times when we felt that the decisions of the Chair were against us, and that those decisions should not have been made in the particular way in which they were made, but in our cooler and calmer judgment there was not one of us who did not feel that if he himself   were in the Chair and were called upon to make a decision, and were expected to act impartially, he would have come to the same decision.  I think it is only right to say that as the result of experience for the last five or six years. 
       I would be glad if we could all agree that whatever our points of view are, that having elected the person to the Chair we will be all prepared to accept his decision and if he has grossly misused his position in any way we have a method of dealing with him and I am quite sure that this House, no matter what Party members may belong to, would have no hesitation whatever in dealing with a person who would misuse the position in which he had been placed.  I think it would be well if we could all agree to work on the basis that having elected a Ceann Comhairle, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle or an ordinary Deputy to preside, his judgment for the time being must be accepted as unquestioned.  That was the reason I stated in regard to Deputy Flinn in that incident a moment ago, that it was not the original statement that I objected to on the part of Deputy Flinn so much as the fact that when you informed him that it was a grossly disorderly statement he should have withdrawn it. But he refused to withdraw it.  It was therein that I took exception to Deputy Flinn's action, not so much to the first portion of it.  You having told him that the statement was grossly disorderly he should have withdrawn it.  If he had accepted that position and submitted and agreed to withdraw I am quite certain the matter would be over.  I believe it is not creditable to this country as a whole that scenes such as we had before us in the last week or two should continue. 
     
     
      
       Hear hear. 
     
     
      
       I am not for a moment attempting to place blame one way or another for these things at the moment but I do say that it would be well for all of us to recognise that this Parliament and the doings of this Parliament are read about and spoken of and discussed not alone all through this country but far and wide throughout   the world and that we ought no matter what Party we belong to be jealous of the good name of the Parliament of the country because the nice little distinctions we may have in mind in this House as to what this Dail stands for and does not stand for, are not recognised outside this country at all events. 
       This Parliament is looked upon as the Parliament of the Irish Free State and every member of it ought to be jealous of its good name and do his best to preserve it. 
     
     
      
       I would like to recall to the House one matter with reference to the authority of the Chair and defiance of the Chair.  Some years ago a Minister made a statement to which the Chair took exception and he was asked to withdraw it.  He demurred. The House was adjourned. The Minister was informed that in view of the definite request of the Chair the statement should be withdrawn and that if he failed to withdraw it although he was a Minister, the President would have no option but to move for his suspension.  On the reassembly of the House that particular Minister withdrew the statement which the Chair had requested him to withdraw.  I mention that to indicate what has happened to Deputy Flinn is a thing that if similar circumstances had arisen in the case of a Minister would have followed in his case.  As far as I am concerned I personally have been called upon once or twice to withdraw statements made in the House.  I thought they were statements I might make but when the Chair thought they were statements I ought not to have made I withdrew them.  If I had not withdrawn them I am positive that what happened to Deputy Flinn would have happened to me.  There is really no bias in this matter.  We have tried in this matter to act in the interests of the good name of the House and in such a way as to secure the most efficient and orderly transaction of business in the House. I do not want to speak at all in any slighting strain with reference to the Deputies on the other side of the House but I agree with Deputy O'Connell that they have been a comparatively   short time in the House and perhaps have not&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Do not apologise. 
     
     
      
       They have perhaps not given the attention to this matter that they ought to have given and I do think this, that if they would care to set down a motion either for the removal of the present Ceann Comhairle or by way of a challenge to any particular decision of his we, perhaps, could have an orderly and informative debate on the whole question and I believe they would at that debate learn something that has not come to their minds yet. 
     
     
      
       That has not reference to the motion before the House.  I would like to hear first the point of order Deputy de Valera raised with regard to the amendment. 
     
     
      
       Some members of our Party wished to put in an amendment to this motion but the notice given was too short.  It appeared on the Order Paper yesterday. 
     
     
      
       May I suggest to the President the advisability of not proceeding with this motion to-day. I think perhaps the atmosphere is not the best in view of the discussion that has taken place.  If there were general acceptance of the position and agreement amongst all Parties of the House that whatever the ruling of the Chair is it would be definitely obeyed there would be no need for this.  At any rate I make a suggestion.  The discussion of this motion would be better in a calmer and different atmosphere from what has been created as a result of the incidents here to-day. I think the motion should be taken to-morrow morning or next Wednesday and perhaps some more useful discussion might come from it.  I just throw out the suggestion. 
     
     
      
       I am not disposed to agree to the suggestion except on a certain basis, that is, that the Ceann Comhairle must be regarded as the custodian of the rights of the members of the Dail.  In that capacity and in his capacity as President over   this House his authority must be freely and voluntarily recognised, and all Parties must agree to it, otherwise I have an objection to the withdrawing of the motion. 
     
     
      
       That is my suggestion, that if the matter were left over until to-morrow morning an undertaking of that kind would be the best way of getting over the difficulty, an undertaking by all Parties that that would be recognised as the position in future. 
     
     
      
       I rather deprecate Deputy O'Connell's suggestion that it should be necessary to ask any Deputies or Parties in this House to give an undertaking that they would be willing to abide by the decisions of the Chair.  I regard it as fundamental that when Deputies come into this House they must abide by the rulings of the Chair, and I think to suggest that any other course is open to any Deputy or body of Deputies acting as a Party in this House is a suggestion which should never have been made.  I had not intended making any remarks upon the discussion which has taken place in regard to the Chair, and I do not intend to go very far now, but I would like to endorse the remarks made by Deputy O'Connell with regard to the conduct of the Chair and the conduct of members in regard to the Chair.  The Chair has no such thing as infallibility, as you, sir, so clearly stated, but where you err, or any other occupant of that Chair errs, provided your error is not gross or intentional, there is one thing that must be observed, and that is obedience to the directions and decisions of the Chair.  I have had experience of being dissatisfied with the decisions of Chairmen from time to time in other assemblies as well as this, but if the business of the House is to be carried on there is only one way of carrying it on, and that is absolute obedience and submission to the decision of the Chair.  If that decision is questioned it can be questioned in the manner you have mentioned by putting down a motion, but as far as suggesting, as Deputy O'Connell has, that any Deputies would, at any time, have the right to question the decision of   the Chair, I say that is a suggestion which should and could not be tolerated by any deliberative assembly in any part of the world. 
       Now with respect to Deputy O'Connell I think that to ask for this motion to be held over with the hope of having some understanding arrived at that in future the decision of the Chair is to be respected and is to be obeyed is suggesting that at present it is the intention of members not to abide by the decision of the Chair, and I think that is, if I might say so, with respect to him, a wrong interpretation to place upon the intentions or conduct of members of this House.  We are here to conduct the business of this House, and the only means whereby it can be conducted is by the election of a Chairman and the abiding by the decisions of that Chairman.  Therefore, I do not see that anything would be gained by the suggestion that, I am sure, Deputy O'Connell has put forward in the best of faith. 
     
     
      
       I would like to explain that I thought my suggestion was not capable of the interpretation Deputy Redmond put on it, because I accept at once what he says, that it should be the duty of every Deputy to obey the Chair; but I do say that I believe general agreement amongst all Parties of the House and general acceptance of that principle which he and I accept and agree to would be even a better way of achieving what we are all anxious to achieve than making any Standing Order.  That is the reason of my suggestion, in order to give every opportunity of expression to general agreement from all sides of the House as to that general principle. 
     
     
      
       On the point of order with regard to the amendments to this motion, the motion is quite definite, and clearly must be regarded as simply being a reference to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges and a matter not requiring the usual notice.  With regard to the possible amendments, I find it somewhat difficult to find what kind of amendments can be put down.  I think Deputy de Valera mentioned an amendment dealing with the whole position   of the Chair.  If it is for the purpose of putting such an amendment down that he desires to have the motion postponed I do not think such amendments could be accepted. 
     
     
      
       I have been approached by members of this Party on the question of insufficient notice. They pointed out to me that they wished to put down certain amendments. I have not discussed the amendments. I gather that in the main one of the amendments was dealing with the position of the Chair in general, the question of whether the Chair should have an original vote, for example. 
     
     
      
       That question could not arise by way of amendment to this motion.  I think no amendment could be put down to this motion which would deal with the position of the Chair.  The matter the Deputy mentioned could be raised on a substantive motion, but not in any way by an amendment to this motion, which is quite specific and narrow.  Therefore it seems to me the motion is one which comes under the provisions of Standing Order 25, which says: 
       Provided that by permission of the Ceann Comhairle, motions may be made on shorter notice. 
       The Standing Order gives a discretion to the Ceann Comhairle, and this is the kind of motion which appears to me might be discussed on the notice already given.  I am accepting the motion, therefore. 
     
     
      
       On the motion itself, the President when introducing it, differentiated between what he called disorderly conduct towards a private member and disorderly conduct towards the Chair.  I have tried, in the few minutes at my disposal since he made that statement, to look through the Standing Orders to see if there was anything of the kind mentioned.  As far as I can see, there is not anything of the kind mentioned.  Disorderly conduct, I take it, is disorderly conduct from the point of view of the Chair.  In keeping order the Chair is responsible and nothing will become disorderly until it   is adverted to by the Chair and until the Chair takes action and either the disorder immediately ceases or else whatever disorder is there is disorder against the Chair.  I see no point whatever in the distinction the President has tried to draw.  The Standing Orders seem to me to be quite sufficient; they give sufficient power to deal with any particular matter.  The Chairman has an opportunity in all cases to put any question to the judgment of the House and, as he has done on a couple of occasions recently, he is able in these cases to get any remedies that are required.  It seems to me that to make rules to meet what are regarded as immediate instances is always dangerous. The tendency is to have only one aspect of the question considered, whereas there are other aspects which should be borne in mind.  These are much more likely to be borne in mind by a Committee sitting down quietly, as the Committee that originally drew up these Standing Orders I assume sat down, to consider what powers are necessary for the Ceann Comhairle in order to maintain order and at the same time having in mind possible abuses by the Chair of the powers which the Chair has.  We must not leave that out of sight.  I think it is very foolish for members, because something has happened recently that they might object to, to suddenly give the Chair powers which the Chair up to the present has not got. The Chair is in a position of great power here.  In any assembly of the kind it is also in a position of great power.  There is a temptation when people are in a position of almost arbitrary power to abuse it, and we ought to be very careful indeed before we give greater powers to the Chair and put, as I would regard it, greater temptations in the way of the exercise of these powers.  It was said that if the Chair made a ruling to which we object we could bring that matter before the House.  To take one of the instances that have occurred recently to which members of our Party objected&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I do not think the Deputy can take it on this motion.  This is not a motion for   giving greater power to the Chair, but a motion for referring certain matters to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  If the motion were passed, and any Standing Orders that might be prepared by the Committee were brought before the House which did, in fact, give further power to the Chair the Deputy would be in order in discussing the matter.  On this motion the Deputy, I think, is not in order in discussing a particular action of the Chair or the powers of the Chair either. 
     
     
      
       My only reason for dealing with that was the suggestion of the President.  The suggestion was that there is not in the Standing Orders powers sufficient for the Chair. That was my understanding of the reason he gave for bringing forward this motion.  I expect the intention, therefore, is to give the Chair greater powers than it has by means of some further Standing Orders.  As this is the first step in that process I am opposing it, because I want to point out that it is not advisable to put too great powers in the hands of the Chair, or more than is necessary to enable the Chair to conduct the business properly It has been argued that if there is objection to a ruling of the Chair it is possible for the aggrieved party to put down a motion and get the particular question decided by the House.  I hold that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred that is impracticable, because the particular matter&mdash;though from the Deputy's point of view it may be serious &mdash;it may be a question from his point of view of encroaching upon the private rights of members here&mdash;still it would hardly be regarded as sufficient to bring a motion before the House which, in effect, would mean the removal of the Ceann Comhairle.  The removing of the Ceann Comhairle would be very serious.  You will admit that there would have to be a very big case made for it.  The instances might accumulate from day to day&mdash;there might be a thousand and one instances where partiality would at least be felt by the aggrieved member, but it would not be sufficient to put down a motion of this kind.  To go further than the Standing Orders at this moment, in my opinion, would be most unwise.  As   I say, it would be felt that it would be a Standing Order brought in by one Party practically to deal with a certain specific occasion, and the dangers that would result from that would not be adverted to, possibly, and given the full weight that would be given to them on another occasion when the Standing Orders were brought from the point of view of the general conduct of business, the point of view of giving the Chair sufficient powers and not giving the Chair more powers than are absolutely necessary for the maintenance of order here.  Accordingly, I intend to oppose this particular motion.  I think it is not necessary, and I think it is an unwise motion at this time.  If there is a danger here that you are trying to correct I believe that you will be running from one danger into one that is even greater.  I hold there is greater danger in the occupants of the Chair being given arbitrary powers, if the occupants of the Chair will abuse their powers, than there is in anything like continued disorder here and disorderly conduct towards the Chair.  I think that disorderly conduct, as expressed here directly towards the Chair, is much less likely and much less a danger to the members of this House, and order here, than would be the giving to any individual further unnecessary powers which might be arbitrarily used. 
     
     
      
       I would just like to say that I do not quite agree with Deputy de Valera.  I did not take that meaning from the President's statement, namely, that the idea underlying this motion was to give greater powers to the Chair, but rather to give greater powers to the House to deal with attacks on the Chair.  That is my understanding of the motion.  I would have preferred, as I said, that the President should postpone this motion, but if the President puts it to the House, I shall vote for it, because I believe, as Deputy de Valera himself said, speaking of a Committee that drew up previous Standing Orders, that a Committee sitting down calmly and discussing various possibilities and probabilities as to what might arise, would be in a better position than this House to decide as to what provision should   be made in the Standing Orders for the protection of the person elected by the Dail to occupy the Chair.  I believe that Standing Orders are not made to be permanent.  They cannot be such. They are being continually added to, changed, altered and revised in the light of experience gained in their operation.  That is the case with Acts of Parliament, with rules of organisations, and with Standing Orders for various assemblies.  Sometime you will come up against the position in which, despite all your forethought, you will find that no provision has been made to meet a particular class of incident. It is well that these matters should be considered, and I think that a motion of this kind, to set up a Committee to consider Standing Orders to meet such a situation, is a proper motion to be considered and would be useful in the light of experience gained, especially in the last few months.  Therefore I propose to vote for it. 
     
     
      
       I fail to see what purpose will be served by bringing this motion before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It would be far better if the Government would produce their plan now.  There is no use in going to the subterfuge of pretending that this matter has the sanction of a Committee when we know the same thing will happen there as will happen here.  There will be a Party point of view there also.  As I say, the matter will be decided in the same way in Committee as it will be decided here.  It would be more honest for the President, instead of proposing a motion to refer the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to produce the scheme now which he had in mind and to debate it here and now. If the motion is adopted it would mean that their scheme which has been arrived at would have the appearance of having the approval of the Committee. The majority Party will naturally decide it.  I am not saying anything at present about the position of the Chair. Let us have the Government opinion on this matter. 
     
     
      
       Like Deputy Boland, I feel that whatever disciplinary order is now to be recommended   to this House it would be much better that we should discuss it in the open&mdash; the reason for it, the justification of it and the consequences of it&mdash;rather than send it before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I am not prepared to discuss the particular motion of the President at any length, but I should like to be assured from the Chair that when the Committee makes a recommendation to the House we shall have an opportunity of discussing that recommendation fully.  It has happened before, in connection with a matter that was referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and to other bodies, that we did not get an opportunity of discussing it in this House.  I would like, therefore, to have an assurance that we shall have an opportunity of discussing this particular recommendation, whatever it may be. 
     
     
      
       The terms of the motion are: &ldquo;That the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be instructed to draw up for the consideration of the Dail a Standing Order or Standing Orders dealing specifically with Deputies who bring the House into contempt by disorderly conduct towards the Chair.&rdquo;  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges, if this motion were carried, would proceed to draw up a Standing Order or Orders for the consideration of the Dail, and would report the suggested Standing Order or Orders to the Dail.  Before these could become Orders of the House they would have to be adopted by the House on motion, and therefore would have to be discussed.  If there were only one Standing Order there might be only one discussion, but if there were two or three they might be discussed in two particular ways&mdash;first on Committee, and then on Report. 
     
     
      
       I take it that we have the assurance of the Chair that we shall have an opportunity of discussing this matter. 
     
     
      
       There is no need of an assurance.  The terms in the motion are clear.  If the Committee suggest to the House Standing Orders   they cannot come into force without definite action being taken here, and that action involves debate. 
     
     
      
       If you get this motion through, and new Standing Orders come into existence, it will mean that you will have Standing Order after Standing Order until they will come upon us like a whirlwind.  That, of course, is all part of the panic and haste that we are used to, but it is not the way to approach the question. 
     
     
      
       If the President is not satisfied with the penalties which the present Standing Orders impose on those who violate the rules of the House, I think, like Deputy Boland, it would be more honest on his part to tell the House that he has another series of constitutional amendments to throw at us, and that preparation is being made for the more speedy passage of these amendments, or whatever other legislative measures he intends to introduce which he believes will give rise to other scenes.  As I said on the last occasion when another incident occurred&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       We are not discussing incidents. 
     
     
      
       I refer to the causes of the incident. 
     
     
      
       Nor the causes of the incident. 
     
     
      
       The causes of the incident are deep and fundamental with those of us who have fallen foul of the Chair.  I think that the present Standing Orders are quite sufficient for the maintenance of order in the House.  I would go further and say that any new clauses, added with a view to imposing further penalties on those who violate the Standing Orders, if they are intended to serve the purpose for which I think they are intended, will fail miserably, because those of us who take up a certain attitude do not do so for the purpose of bringing the House into disrepute&mdash;that should be made clear to the President and everybody else&mdash; it is not for that purpose or for the purpose of abusing the Speaker or anything like that, but rather because it is the only method left to express indignation   and contempt for the methods which accompany the introduction of certain measures here, and I say that no matter what amendment or addition you make in regard to those Standing Orders we will always find means of expressing our indignation if necessary. 
     
     
      
       I would have imagined that the President would have had sufficient wisdom to let sleeping dogs lie and that when the row had passed, he would have tried to get on with the ordinary business about which he appears to be so anxious.  We have already wasted a considerable amount of time which might be devoted to dealing with the Agricultural Credit Bill, the Creamery Bill or some of the other Bills which are matters of importance. If I might express a more or less neutral point of view, there is a Party here labouring under a feeling of deep grievance about certain constitutional amendments.  That has led to a position where they have felt that certain resolutions have been passed which do not state the truth and where the closure has been accepted too rapidly and too often.  Everything is being done according to plan.  We are being guillotined into adopting certain measures which we wish to prevent being adopted.  That feeling is likely to create another feeling, that every measure from the Government Benches is a measure to paralyse every action of our Party in this House and to exasperate us if possible to such an extent that we will be forced to go out of this House.  I do not know whether Parliamentary action can be maintained on these lines but I would imagine that if people were serious about continuing Parliamentary business, when a row is over, they would allow the matter to lie and they would try to carry on the work of the country without pressing matters to such an extent as to put a large Party in the country into the position of being outlaws and into the position in which they cannot exercise their rights as representatives of the citizens who voted for them. 
     
     
      
       On a point of order.  I submit that this motion is not in order.   This motion does not ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, directly or in a correct manner to report on what measures should be taken to deal with Deputies who act in a disorderly manner towards the Chair or with Deputies who bring the House into contempt by disorderly conduct. I submit that an argument has been allowed to creep into this motion.  It has been the general practice that when a motion is put down it should be in the simplest possible form and should not contain any argument.  I would like to have your ruling on that point. 
     
     
      
       I think the motion is in order. 
     
     
      
       A general definition of the term &ldquo;disorderly&rdquo; would be &ldquo;out of order.&rdquo;  When it is taken in conjunction with the Standing Orders it means &ldquo;out of order,&rdquo;&ldquo;not within the Standing Orders.&rdquo;  It may be that very often&mdash;as a matter of fact the Ceann Comhairle has said it&mdash;it is the best thing not to act within the strict letter of the Standing Orders; that, as a matter of fact, it is a good thing to be disorderly on occasions; that on certain occasions it is the best thing that could happen for the business of the House and, I suppose, for the business of the country that disorderly actions should be allowed in the House, and to proceed with business in a disorderly fashion.  We all recognise, everybody must recognise, that when any collection of representatives come together in order to proceed with business, they have to appoint a Chairman, and they have to give him certain powers to keep order.  Everybody recognises that that is a correct thing and will support that.  Most people recognise also, and should recognise, that there are occasions when action is demanded that is not within the Standing Orders. The Ceann Comhairle says that the proper way, if anyone is displeased with the action of the Chair, is to put down a motion asking the Dail to remove the Ceann Comhairle from the Chair.  That is all very well.  That is ordinarily the correct procedure.  That is the procedure which members who disagree with the ruling of the Chair   should ordinarily follow.  But there are occasions&mdash;and the Ceann Comhairle himself has admitted that such occasions crop up&mdash;when it is better for the general business of the House and, we must take it, for the general business of the country, that Standing Orders should not be followed in the strict letter.  There was an occasion recently when I believed that the correct thing to do for Deputies was not to follow the Standing Orders too strictly.  If Deputies feel that the Chair is acting in a wrong manner, in a grossly unfair manner, they, of course, will take whatever steps are open to them to protest against that. There were times before&mdash;we have more experience of Parliaments than Deputy O'Connell would give us credit for&mdash;there was a Dail in existence in 1919&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       It was a one-Party Dail. 
     
     
      
       It was not a one-Party Dail.  It was for the whole of Ireland. 
     
     
      
       What I meant by &ldquo;one-Party&rdquo; was that there was no division in it as you have in a Parliament of this kind.  They were all of the same opinion.  There was no division amongst the people, and the same clash did not occur as has occurred here. 
     
     
      
       The people of Ireland thought that they were all one. 
     
     
      
       I hope Deputy O'Connell will not try to foster the wrong idea that the Black-and-Tan war was carried on by a small section of the people. 
     
     
      
       I want to make myself quite clear in regard to this matter.  What I meant was that, although they represented all Ireland, or the greater part of Ireland, there were no party divisions such as there are in this Parliament, that you were all imbued by the one political ideal. That is not the position in a Parliament of this kind. 
     
     
     
      
       All classes and creeds were represented in the Dail at that time, but members while they agreed fundamentally, had many different ideas as to how details were to be carried out. 
     
     
      
       But you had not, as we have here, a Government Party and an Opposition Party. 
     
     
      
       An Imperial Party and a Republican Party. 
     
     
      
       Anywhere you have a Government, you will always have an Opposition.  On one occasion the Ceann Comhairle of that Dail acted in a grossly disorderly and unconstitutional manner, and the position was that when those people, who disagreed with him wanted to put down a motion, six years afterwards, to deal with him he had gone.  They had to choose some other method. 
     
     
      
       I do not think that the Deputy on this motion ought to deal with the action of any Ceann Comhairle.  As a matter of fact, the particular matter which the Minister for Finance mentioned to-day, arose by way of a member of the House, a Minister, making reflections on one of my predecessors.  I do not think any reference can be made, on a motion of this kind, either to the Ceann Comhairle at present or any of his predecessors.  I do not know what the Deputy is going to lead up to&mdash; I have no idea&mdash;but I think it is unfair to use this particular motion to express a view about the action of some previous person in the Chair of the Dail. 
     
     
      
       I do not want to be unfair to anyone.  I am simply giving an instance, which is pretty well known throughout the country, when it was too late to deal with an offence committed by the Ceann Comhairle when the opportunity arose to put down a motion dealing with the matter. I am just pointing out that when the Ceann Comhairle does behave in a wrong manner, while people generally recognise that the ordinary procedure should be to deal with it by way of motion, sometimes other methods have to be adopted.  We would like it to be recognised more definitely that   while the Standing Orders and the Constitution are there whoever says he is going to act within the Constitution and the Standing Orders should act within the strict letter of the law. We hold that the Ceann Comhairle should be governed by the Standing Orders and also by the Constitution. We do not hold that the Ceann Comhairle should act as an angel above all parties, and that he should not be a member of any political party.  We believe that any Ceann Comhairle elected became a member of the House because he held certain Party views and we believe that should be recognised and that the Ceann Comhairle should not be put in the impossible position of make-belief that he has no political opinion. 
     
     
      
       He is not in that position.  Nobody ever suggested that the Ceann Comhairle should be put in the position of pretending that he has had no political beliefs&mdash;no such thing.  I disclaim quite freely and fully and frankly here any such idea as that I have no political opinions. 
     
     
      
       I am glad to hear that. 
     
     
      
       No such thing has ever been suggested anywhere, that a Chairman should be elected in this House, or anywhere else that I ever heard of, on the grounds that he had no political opinions. 
     
     
      
       Do you also deny political Party affiliations? 
     
     
      
       Political Party affiliations are one thing, political opinions are a different thing. The Deputy is now discussing the position of the Ceann Comhairle; this is a motion to refer certain matters to a Committee, and the Deputy is not in order in continuing on that question. 
     
     
      
       I do not want to continue. I only want to say that I think the best thing would be to have it recognised that whoever is in the Chair has political opinions and is entitled to have political opinions and to act and vote for his constituents while he is in the Chair.  We believe that the proper way to deal with this matter   would be to ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to draw up a scheme which would empower the Ceann Comhairle, or whoever might be in the Chair for the time being, to exercise his vote on all occasions in which he wished to exercise it.  That would be a much better way.  It would do away with the pretence that some people&mdash;I am not saying the Ceann Comhairle does it&mdash;make that the Chair has no political affiliations, that the Chair has no political views. Whoever is in the Chair came into this House because he had political ideas and affiliations, and no minority or majority should ask him to get rid of these because he happens to go into the Chair.  All that should be asked of the Ceann Comhairle, or the Chairman for the time being, is that, while in the Chair, he will give fair, impartial judgments on all matters of order and procedure put up to him.  The best way to get rid of all irritation would be that the Ceann Comhairle, or whoever occupies the Chair, could say to all the world: &ldquo;I hold certain political views; I hold them strongly; and am prepared to vote for them; but I will give all parties fair play in matters of procedure.&rdquo;  I believe that if that were done it would enable the Ceann Comhairle to act in a much fairer and more impartial manner. 
     
     
      
       rose. 
     
     
      
       I think Deputy Gorey should allow the President to conclude the debate. 
     
     
      
       If I might say one word.  The wording of this motion is very simple.  It merely says: 
       &ldquo;That the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be instructed to draw up for the consideration of the Dail a Standing Order or Standing Orders dealing specifically with Deputies who bring the House into contempt by disorderly conduct towards the Chair.&rdquo; 
     
     The matter arises because the previous Standing Orders, when they were being framed, never contemplated the class of disorder that we had here for the last week.  They were meant to deal with a different class of disorder altogether&mdash; disorder in debate, disorder between   one Deputy and another&mdash;quite a different matter from disorder towards the Chair.  I might say that in my opinion there is even a difference between the disorder of Deputy Flinn and of Deputy Aiken. 
     
      
       We are not discussing either Deputy Flinn or Deputy Aiken, or their order or disorder. I think the Deputy is completely out of order in going into that. 
     
     
      
       I think it would be a good thing for the House and for Deputies themselves, and it would protect Deputies from themselves, if there was a specific order dealing with disorder to the Chair.  I am not speaking at all from the point of view of personal feelings or political feeling, but I am trying to view the matter from the point of view of the procedure of the House and good feeling between all Parties in this House.  I think Deputy Aiken would be the first to admit that the conduct we had here on last Thursday&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       That particular conduct is not before us.  It has been dealt with and is closed. 
     
     
      
       Very well, I think Deputies should welcome a new and more explicit order as a protection for themselves. 
     
     
      
       I think Deputy Gorey has provided a very good reason why this motion should not be proceeded with.  After all a motion to prepare a new Standing Order, ought to be for the guidance of the House apart from particular personalities.  It is quite evident that the Standing Orders Committee will have in mind one or two persons when framing this new Standing Order.  Is it desirable that one will be able to open the Standing Orders and say: &ldquo;This one was framed to deal with so and so&rdquo; and of another &ldquo;this was framed to deal with so and so&rdquo;?  Is that a desirable thing and is it going to lead to good feeling in this House?  In my opinion no statesman would press such a motion, especially in view of the speech made by Deputy Gorey. 
     
     
      
       It is the business   of the House to frame its own rules and regulations.  In answer to Deputy Boland I may say I have not in mind, and never had in mind, a Standing Order to deal with this situation.  I have perhaps had less to do with Standing Orders, and the drawing up of them than any member of the House. The submission for consideration of this matter to the Committee on Privileges and Procedure is the orthodox method to get a Report from the Committee drawn from all sections of the House.  I would strongly advise considering the matter free from any entanglements, political or otherwise, and endeavour to get such regulation or regulations as will add to the dignity and decorum and despatch of the business of the House.  These are the main considerations. 
     
     
      
       Is the President suggesting now that the Government Party&mdash;I do not suggest himself&mdash;has not a scheme in course of preparation to deal with this? 
     
     
      
       I am not alone suggesting but I am stating there is no such scheme. 
     
     
      
       Is the President not in the confidence of his Whips? 
     
     
      
       That is the matter that falls for consideration by this Committee. 
     
     
      
       I am a member of it. 
     
     
      
       Yes, and I am sure a good, capable and competent member of it.  I wish other members of the Deputy's Party would approach the solution of such a problem as this with such a detached view as the Deputy. I believe if the Deputy had had an opportunity of interviewing Deputy MacEntee before he made his deplorable statement a few moments ago he would not have made it&mdash;that he would at least have read the motion before he objected to it. 
     
     
      
       I did not object to the motion. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy has experience. 
     
     
     
      
       I do not say the Deputy lacks experience but it is lack of attention to ordinary duty as a member of this House.  Any amount of experience would never give one that attention to duty which comes only from the spirit of devotion to duty.  That is what the Deputy has not developed yet.  I am sure it will   come from the excellent example he sees on these benches. 
     
     
      
       Is the President considering introducing the Flogging Bill here. 
     
     
      
       No, I am not considering that.

     CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT No. 6) BILL, 1928&mdash;FIFTH STAGE. 
     
      
       I move that the Bill do now pass. 
     
     
      
       Before this House gives its final assent to this Bill I would like, even at the eleventh hour, to ask some of those who have gone into the Lobby in support of this Bill through all its stages, to reconsider their position. Some Deputies in the Party opposite, I am sure, go to the trouble of reading their own official organ, &ldquo;The Freeman,&rdquo; or &ldquo;An Saoranach.&rdquo; I did not procure a copy of the organ myself last week, but I read an extract from it in to-day's Press.  That extract dealt with the possibility of a visit from a member of the Royal Family to this country, and it said that the Executive Council could not entertain the possibility of inviting a member of the Royal Family to this country at the present time, because the forces of West Britonism in this country would make such a demonstration of their loyalty to the Empire that it would stink in the nostrils of any decent Irish Nationalist.  And what is this House actually doing by passing this Bill?  We are allowing the Seanad&mdash;and it is not clear whether the out-going members of the Seanad can or cannot participate in the election&mdash;to vote for the incoming Senators.  And the personnel of the Seanad, as we all know, is largely taken from a class that their own official organ says would make such a lavish display of Imperialism in connection with the Royal visit that it would stink in the nostrils of decent Irish Nationalists.  In fact, those who will vote for this Bill are doing what their own organ says they should not do.  They are entrenching Imperialism in one House of this Oireachtas.  They are giving the Seanad the possibility of power by leaving them a majority in that House; they are leaving them the possible power next year or the year after to invite a member of the Royal Family to come across and give such a display. 
       The mode of election to any body such as the Seanad should be through the people, and the elected representatives of the people&mdash;the people elected by a popular franchise.  They are the proper people to elect such a body as the Seanad.  Members nominated by this Executive Council, or any future Executive Council, should not have power to vote in this election.  Next to popular election throughout the various constituencies the nearest approach we can have to popular election is election by members who are elected themselves by a popular franchise. Even in the vain hope that, at the last moment, some members on the Government Benches and Independent Deputies will reconsider their view and at this stage vote against the Bill I would make that appeal to them, if it is not too late. 
     
     
      
       took the Chair. 
     
     
      
       I had the misfortune to come into the House yesterday while Deputy O'Hanlon was making a speech, and I heard him more or less misrepresenting our attitude, whether deliberately or not I do not know.  At any rate, it was a misrepresentation of the facts.  The Deputy was ably helped out by Deputy Gorey.  They wanted to imply that our representatives on this Committee were at one time in favour of this method of election&mdash;that is, that our Party were at first in favour of it and are not now in favour of it.  I think if those particular Deputies, or any Deputies with whom they have influence,   will go back and read the reports of the Joint Committee, they will find that Deputy Ruttledge did vote against the method of direct election by the people.  But it was made very clear afterwards, in another vote that was taken, that that was to prepare the way afterwards for election by the Dail, and that no member of our Party or that Committee or in this House has ever countenanced election of members of the Seanad by the Seanad.  As stated by our leader here when this Bill appeared first, we are prepared to have an election to the Seanad by the Dail rather than by the people, but we would much prefer, as against election by the Dail and Seanad together, to go back to election by the people; that is, if election by the Dail alone were impossible. 
       The point has been made here over and over again that this election by the Seanad and Dail combined is going to give undue representation to a certain section of the people in this country. There is a section, who may be called a minority in this part of the country at any rate, and they have very nearly half the representation of the Seanad at the present time.  That number of votes, combined with seven direct representatives that the same Party have in this House and the half-a-dozen others who are, for the present, members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, but who, it may be expected, will vote for the same type of representative as the thirty in the Seanad and the seven here&mdash;all those votes combined would be able to elect four out of that minority into the Seanad. That would mean that as the life of a member of the Seanad is to be nine years in future, that particular section of the people will have an undue representation in the Seanad for about six elections&mdash;that is, six times nine, or fifty-four years, which is far and away more than the President ever anticipated when he said here some time ago that they should get representation for twenty or thirty years. 
     
     We had an instance, during the local elections recently, where a certain Senator sought to become a member of his own urban council, and he got twenty-five votes.  Twenty-five people of his native place where he,   and a certain number of generations before him, lived, were prepared to give him their first preferences.  Now take eleven men like that in the Seanad.  He is a Senator, and there are eleven like him, and they are able to vote for a Senator.  That would mean that the Senator would be elected with about 275 popular votes in the country behind him.  If you take the Senators elected by the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or elected by the members of the Labour Party or the members of our Party here, each of them would represent six or seven thousand votes. You would have the same sort of difference in the type of representatives there going on for years to come.  You would have men there, who if they went to the country would presumably get 275 votes, sitting with equal rights and with equal position to the man who would, presumably, if he went to the country, get 7,000 votes, and these very men are to be equal in votes and equal in status and equal in power.  It seems rather strange that the members of this House should agree to a measure which takes such powers out of their hands as would be shown by these figures, that they would voluntarily pass a Bill through this House which would give eleven nominated Senators the same power of electing a Seanad as it would give to eleven elected representatives of this House to elect a Senator with equal power. 
     As Deputy O'Dowd has just said, you have a section of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who are running this rather revolutionary organ called &ldquo;The Freeman&rdquo; which is pointing out the terrible dangers of a visit of a member of the Royal Family to this country at the present time, pointing out how feelings might be aroused amongst the nationalist population against that member of the Royal Family, and how those feelings are to be aroused as a sort of reaction against the reception which would be given by this very section of the Seanad who are going to reproduce themselves under this Bill.  If these men are given a sort of standing, as the Seanad will perhaps give to certain men, and if they use their influence as Senators rather than as individuals,   as they are at present, in welcoming any member of the Royal Family, or doing any other act of that sort which is against the national susceptibilities of the people, we will be held, I suppose, in some measure responsible for passing this Bill through this House to put those very people in that position. 
     
      
       Deputy O'Dowd appealed to members of Cumann na nGaedheal and other members of this House to hesitate before they put the final seal of their approval on the passage of this Bill.  I am not as optimistic as Deputy O'Dowd at this stage, to attempt to appeal to any Deputy who has already voted for this Bill on its numerous passages through the Dail.  I sincerely feel there is no use in attempting any argument, however weighty, with the members of the House who have already approved of this Bill.  Members on this side of the House have spent a lot of time, in fact on some occasions, in the opinion of the Government, they spent too much time, in their opposition to these Bills and particularly this Bill&mdash;sufficient time to warrant the introduction of the guillotine and the moving of the closure. 
       &ldquo;Dublin Opinion&rdquo; in this month's issue has on the front page a sketch of an automatic man and this automatic man is carved out into different sections, each section representing an Article, presumably of the Constitution. I believe it would do the members who approve of this Bill good to study that picture.  We asked here if the House would decide what were fundamental Articles of the Constitution and what were not.  I would recommend Deputies to study that little automatic man and to find whether Article 47, represented on the chest, or Article 17, represented at the thigh, would be more fundamental than the others. 
     
     In the Seanad yesterday I heard a Senator state that as far as the Seanad was concerned Article 47 was quite useless to them.  Yet, if my memory serves me correctly, and I am open to correction, the President, on the introduction   of this Bill, said that this Bill was, to a certain extent, compensation to the Seanad for the abolition of the rights they would have under Article 47. 
     
      
       Will the Deputy tell us what this Bill is about? 
     
     
      
       It is about the election to the Seanad.  That election is to take place by the members of the Dail and the Seanad instead of by the people. 
     
     
      
       Why does the President not explain the Bill to us? 
     
     
      
       It is very hard to know what all these Bills are about except that they seek to do away with any chances the people in the country have of ordering or regulating the forms of government in future times. 
     
     
      
       &ldquo;That direct representation by the people in the Seanad is undesirable.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Freedom to achieve freedom. 
     
     
      
       I did not hear the President, and I would ask him to repeat what he said. 
     
     
      
       I was merely quoting what members of the Deputy's own Party voted for on the Joint Committee&mdash;&ldquo;Direct representation by the people in the Seanad is undesirable.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Misrepresentation you are out for. 
     
     
      
       He is a master of that. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Briscoe must be allowed to proceed. 
     
     
      
       I have refrained from entering into the debate on these Constitutional Bills except on one occasion. There is no use at all in attempting to put to the House arguments that should weigh with Deputies.  No matter how the arguments would convince them, those who are supporting these measures will support them, and I certainly feel that there is no use attempting to study up even points that would have any bearing.  Dr. Ryan emphasised&mdash;even if this Bill were acceptable&mdash;the unfairness of giving   the same representation to members of the Seanad as to members of this House, first of all by virtue of the constitution of that House, and, secondly, by virtue of the numbers of the House. If a fair mathematical proportion were calculated, the Seanad should only have one in three in comparison with this House.  If there was any semblance of argument on the part of the Government in introducing this Bill it might be thought that that would have some weight with people who do not agree with the election of the Seanad by the people.  I do not intend to delay the House.  I just want to place on record the fact that, while I realise a case has been made and could be made on this side of the House against this Bill, there is not the slightest feeling that it would have any weight whatever with the members who are already out to have this Bill passed and who are committed to it.  So far as I am concerned, I have nothing to say except to place on record my small vote of protest against the passage of this Bill against the undue haste with which it is being put through, to the exclusion of business which should have priority.  We have referred day after day to questions of unemployment throughout the country. We have asked for facilities for matters that are of urgent importance, and we have the Estimates side-tracked.  All these are of far more importance and more urgent than any of these Constitution Amendment Bills. 
     
     
      
       There are, no doubt, great difficulties in trying to devise a Seanad which would give satisfaction to this country.  I dare say if the Earls had not been compelled to leave Ireland or if the flight had not taken place, we might have one solution. That was the solution generally adopted in Europe.  Still it is doubtful if it would be quite satisfactory to-day Civilisation changes.  People get new ideas.  We see in England which had a continuous system of that description that they do not seem to be quite satisfied 
       
         Notice taken that 20 Deputies were not present; House counted and 20 Deputies being present&mdash; 
       
     
     
      
       Anyway most people agreed that the methods whereby   the Upper House was constituted in England is a matter of contention in England.  I suppose at the present moment in Ireland it would certainly be sensible and perhaps very advisable to give serious consideration to this proposal as to how we are to constitute this particular Seanad.  I know very well that we have a good many more difficulties than many other countries have.  We have been subjected no doubt to a great many changes.  We have been subjected to persecutions and those several persecutions have completely disorganised any system that might be suitable to us.  To-day the only people that perhaps the present Constitution states are properly qualified for the position are not people that are or could naturally be in sympathy with us as a nation.  Their outlook is completely different from what the outlook of this nation is.  Their means of livelihood, their education and their social system are not at all in agreement with what our social system would be, and the tendency naturally amongst them would be to constitute a Seanad more or less on the same system as they have in England. But it is quite clear that that system would not be suitable for the people of Ireland.  They would prefer, I am quite sure, to have a good deal of control, to have, in fact, complete control over the election of that Seanad. How to arrive at that is certainly a difficult problem, but, to my mind, and I believe to the mind of this party, the simplest and the best way would be through this Dail, to give them the power of selection.  If the power of selection was handed over completely to the people they would certainly have difficulties in selecting and electing Senators.  Names would not be so well known to them, or qualifications, and we might have the same results as we had on the last occasion.  The great majority of the people took absolutely no interest in the election with the result that only 25 per cent. of the people recorded their votes but, as the people of Ireland are pretty well represented in this Dail, I believe that this Dail is in a position truly to represent what would be to a large extent the wishes of the people in selecting Senators or in selecting an Upper House.  Of course, first and   foremost, we should certainly have decided definitely whether an Upper House is necessary or not or whether they should act as a check on what we do here or whether they should be simply elected as a sort of economic Council.  Most countries, I admit, have an Upper House and when most countries have there must be some necessity for them or they must perform some useful function.  We have reached the last stages of deciding how we are to elect that House.  That is the subject we are on to-day and this House has almost decided that fact.  At the same time it is possible that we may be able to create perhaps some doubts in the minds of the Opposition.  Those doubts may develop or materialise for some other occasion.  That is the only hope that I can express at the present moment.  I consider that the decision has almost been arrived at.  At the same time it is good that we should take a little time and I hope that the Opposition does not consider that I am trying to kill the time or to obstruct. It is not so.  I believe that it is good, right and proper that time be given for serious consideration of this problem, in order that at a future date the friction that has occurred between these two Houses in other countries will not occur here, and in order that, as near as possible, the control or the discretion of the Upper House will be clearly defined and that in the election the people will have the power to elect a Seanad which will be in sympathy with the national outlook in this country, and not a Seanad which through no fault of their own&mdash;perhaps through the fault of birth, surroundings or other circumstances&mdash;is seriously and really opposed to any national development in this country or any development on its own in the way of complete independence. 
     
     I know it is difficult for those people to have any other outlook.  I gave the reasons for this.  There is the question of birth and other things.  They certainly have an excuse, but it must be our duty to see, as far as possible, that they will not wield any undue power, that they will not be in a position to prevent the proper development of this country along national lines. I believe that the Irish people themselves   have the individuality, the character, the determination and the ability to develop this country to as high a degree as any country in the world.  But we must be careful in selecting individuals who will not be inclined for any reason whatsoever to develop this country along lines which are not in sympathy with or which are not agreeable to the national aspirations of this country.  There is the danger that we on these benches anyway have tried to avert.  We have come to the opinion that along certain lines of election we can prevent that particular state of affairs.  That certainly is not a fault.  It is a natural, healthy opposition and it is, I believe, the opinion in general of the majority of the Irish people.  They feel that they have been long enough under the control of elements that were foreign to this country, elements who used every influence and every power that they possessed to divert the energies and the wealth of this country to the use and benefit of the countries to which they were allied, in sympathies and perhaps in birth.  As I said before we cannot blame them.  It is birth and other things that compel them to do that.  It is simply their opinion, but as we here in this country are in the majority our business is to use all the powers that we possess to get in control in this country those who have a distinctly national outlook and who will see that all benefits that may be brought about, all industrial developments, will be used purely and simply for the benefit of this country. 
     
      
       With reference to this Bill, the worst part of it, as far as I can see, is its undemocratic form and the method in which it proposes to elect this Seanad.  The two Houses consist of 153 members of the Dail and 63 members of the Seanad, and assuming that there are nineteen Senators to be elected this gives those who are opposed to Fianna Fail in this House the power to elect eight and the Seanad to elect five.  That is a total of thirteen out of nineteen, and that is altogether out of proportion to public feeling in the country as represented by popularly elected bodies such as this House.  But the most undemocratic   form of this Bill and the most unheard of and unprecedented form is that the retiring Senators are allowed to elect themselves.  It has been contended, I think by Deputy Professor Tierney in a previous debate on this Bill, that ultimately by a process of fractions a desirable Seanad would be got, by a process of fractions, all right, but not in this century.  In this Bill it said the place and conduct of such election shall be regulated by law.  It does not define how or whether the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad or the Ceann Comhairle shall preside, and in either case whether the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach shall have a vote in this election or whether they shall both have a vote. Then this Bill in upsetting popular election does, to my mind, effect a small economy, but its economy is not noticeable because it gives a power of election to these reactionary forces, and it is our belief on these benches that these reactionary forces in the Seanad which, under the Constitution Amendment Bills which are before the Dail, have got extra powers.  The detriment which they have worked to national progress heretofore will be continued indefinitely as far as this Government can help it.  We should deliberate very slowly on these Bills and not rush them through because it may be a temporary political gain to get these Bills through.  You may score on Fianna Fail for the time being, but you are heading where you cannot see.  You are going back in a reactionary fashion.  The power of election you give to the present Seanad, which is unnational and anti-Irish in its outlook, which never did any work which could be termed of a progressive nature as far as this portion of Ireland is concerned, which it is not entitled to, will be a retard on progress.  That Seanad, as presently constituted, could be, if the right spirit were there, the greatest force in this country for the unity of the two broken pieces of Ireland.  But that Seanad has not given any indication whatever that it stands for such a thing, and the very foundation for the thought that nominated originally those Senators, assuming that the President's argument was right that there   was no intimidation from the Crown, and that these nominations were not directly or indirectly from the Crown, and that the idea of Griffith that by a process of friendship and a process of privileges these people would be brought into the national life, that they would lead a national life, and ultimately would be a lever to bring about the unity of North and South, we see now was a mistaken idea. These people never change, and the more one tries to placate them the more they snarl and bite.  It is time that they should just get the ordinary rights of citizens in the Twenty-Six Counties and not get any of the privileges which this Bill gives to them. Let them get their ordinary democratic rights of election in due proportion and, in getting those, they would be getting a much greater advantage than is given to our compatriots in the area in which the co-religionists and co-politicians of these people hold sway.  In that way only will these people come, if they ever do come, into the national life.  In this Bill it is proposed that at the Seanad election &ldquo;the electors shall be the members of Dail Eireann and the members of Seanad Eireann voting together on the principle of proportional representation.&rdquo; Members of Dail Eireann voting together on principles of proportional representation represent the elected will of the people of the 26 Counties, but members of Seanad Eireann represent nobody but themselves. Yet they are given undue powers and, in regard to the nineteen Senators who were elected by popular vote, we find that not more than 25 per cent. of the electors voted in that election.  It is, indeed, questionable how many of the votes cast at that election were valid.  These people are now to be given power under this Bill to re-elect themselves perpetually, so far as the promoters and originators of this Bill are concerned and so far as the Senators themselves can help to do it. 
     
     The Bill says: &ldquo;The voting at such elections shall be by secret ballot and no elector may exercise more than one vote thereat.&rdquo;  The vote at such election shall be by secret ballot.  Why? Are the Executive Council afraid to   show their hands in this election?  Are they afraid, after what has been pointed out here and what has been said in their own official organ, that they will have openly to show their hands against those people whom I am criticising?  They do not want to do that.  If not, why the secret ballot? Deputy O'Hanlon asked how you can have an election under proportional representation without a secret ballot. It is very easy to answer that.  You can have an election under proportional representation by taking the figures of the various Parties in this House and allocating the proportion of seats they are entitled to fill, and let them between themselves put a panel forward and be automatically elected.  That is a more democratic form, as it shows whom you are putting up and standing over.  You have not the secret canvassing and secret arrangements which you will have under the secret ballot provided in the Bill. &ldquo;The place and conduct of such election shall be regulated by law.&rdquo;  Here and now is the time to say where the place of such election shall be and what the conduct of such election shall be.  this is one of a series of Bills which is being rushed in whirlwind fashion through the Dail in order to score off Fianna Fail.  It is actuated by spiteful motives and by a desire for temporary political gain, but there is an old saying, &ldquo;Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.&rdquo; 
     
      
       I would like to re-echo the views expressed by Deputy Dr. O'Dowd.  I do not wish to appeal here to those who have done their utmost from 1916 to 1922 to prevent the people of Ireland getting any shape or form of freedom and who were elected to the Seanad by the forces of West Britonism. I regret to say that very few of those to whom I wish to appeal are present.  The Minister for Justice laughs, but he is not one of those to whom I wish to appeal. 
     
     
      
       Thanks. 
     
     
      
       I know it would be useless to do so, but when I see this sixth stepping-stone to a Republic, this sixth   move on the part of freedom to obtain freedom, I am anxious to appeal to those who believe in that and who, when they voted for the Treaty voted for it under the impression that they were voting for freedom to obtain freedom, and that they intended, by easy stages, to attain the absolute independence of this nation.  I would wish to appeal to them before they pass this Bill, which is going to hang around the necks of the Irish people a millstone in the form of those forces who were out openly and definitely against them when they were attempting to gain a measure of independence, but who are now, moryah, their best friends because they are assisting to bring about measures against which they fought from 1916 to 1922.  It is for that reason I would wish to appeal to Deputies here who were members of Sinn Fein and members of the I.R.A. from 1916 to 1922 to put an end now to this thing which is not a stepping-stone to freedom, but which is a stepping-stone to slavery, and to worse than slavery. Surely to goodness you have seen enough and have felt enough of what these people would do to you if they could during the Tan regime in this country, but you now wish to restore to them all the power they have lost. When I read over this Bill&mdash;I am glad the Minister for Justice is not asleep; I was afraid I would have to wake him a while ago&mdash;and when I see here that the Seanad has to be elected by themselves, and when we remember that there are 63 fossils up there&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Now, now! 
     
     
      
       &mdash;that there are 63 gentlemen up there&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       There are only 60. 
     
     
      
       If there are only 60, so much the better.  I wish there were none.  I would be very glad if there were none.  But when we think of those 60 gentlemen coming solemnly together, and when we realise that out of 19 of them who are going to retire six are definitely going to be kept there, surely nothing more ridiculous could be imagined.  When we remember that one of those gentlemen,   when he went before the electors even in his own town, only got 55 votes, and that that gentleman is going to come in here and represent the people of Ireland, or the people of this piece of an island that was once Ireland, it is, to say the least of it, disgusting.  It is enough to make even those of us who were luke-warm in the cause from 1916 to 1922 hesitate before we walk into the Lobby to vote for the continued slavery of the Irish people, because that is what it means.  If the Government did not realise that the people are sick of that, that the people have decided definitely on the first opportunity to get rid of them, they would have hesitated before putting through constitutional amendment after constitutional amendment, each amendment having the definite intention of putting into power here, when they clear out, a Second Chamber which will be there to carry out the wishes, not of the Irish people, but the wishes of the British Government across the water. 
     
     Deputy Kennedy stated that the Seanad represented nobody but themselves. I would wish to correct that idea.  I know very well whom the Seanad represents.  I have no delusions as to whom they represent, for I have a bitter knowledge of whom they represented from 1916 to 1922.  When I see here that this election is to be by secret ballot I do not share Deputy Kennedy's view that it is because the members of the Executive Council do not wish to let those people see that they are going to vote against them.  I believe the members of the Executive Council would elect the same staunch old Unionists who will see that George is not going to be let down in this country. Nothing more ridiculous than having a second chamber re-electing six of their own members by their own votes alone, can be imagined.  There were several comments made here as to electors not voting at the last Seanad election which showed definitely, to my mind at any rate, that the people do not want the Seanad.  The people showed that they had no use for the Seanad, that they are not going to put anybody into it if they could.  The result was that nobody voted at the last election except a few Jingoes and members of Southern   Unionist Organisations.  It was they who elected the last 16 members to that Seanad.  Now we are going to have elected to that Seanad 13 of the 19 new members as the representatives of West Britonism in this country.  I cannot call it anything else.  When we realise that, I wish to make a last appeal to those members here who believed that at the time they were supporting the Treaty they were out to get a stepping stone to the Republic and who believed that the Treaty was going to mean freedom to attain freedom and I ask them even at this last moment to go into the Lobby and vote against this iniquitous measure which is going to elect here in permanency a second Chamber composed of Southern Unionists and disgruntled politicians. 
     
      
       Ise mo thuairim go mba cheart gan aon Seanad den tsaghas ata ann a bheith againn, ach os rud e go bhfuil se socruithe ag an Rialtas Seanad do bheith ann, silim fhein go mb'fhearr gan nios mo na 36 Seanadoiri a bheith ann.  B'fheidir nach mbaineann an cheist sin leis an mBille seo. 
       D'fheadfai an Seanad d'fheabhsu agus d'iarrfainn ar lucht Chumann na nGaedheal feachaint chuige conus mar is feidir e d'fheabhsu.  Ta sli amhain in ar feidir e d'fheabhsu anois&mdash;trid an modh toghtha.  Ba cheart an togha d'fhagaint fa'n Dail amhain, mar ta Teachtai na Dala freagarthach do mhuinntir na tire&mdash;no do chuid aca. Toghadh ag na daoine Teachtai na Dala agus ta siad freagarthach do na daoine.  Ce a dearfaidh go bhfuil na Seanadoiri annsin le &ldquo;toil na ndaoine&rdquo;&mdash;rud ar a raibh a lan cainnte cupla blian o shoin?  Mar adubhradh cheana, ta iarla orra agus chuaidh de 25 votai d'fhail sa Togha um Rialtas Aitiuil coicis o shoin.  Ce adearfaidh gur toil na ndaoine, daoine mar sin a bheith ar an Seanad? 
       Dubhras inde nach raibh me i gcoinne ceart agus cothrom do thabhairt do lucht an tSeanaid.  Nior mhaith liom aon mhi-thuisgint a bheith ann mar gheall ar a ndubhras.  Is ceart cothrom na feinne a bheith ag gach Eireannach, is cuma ce'n dream polaitiochta ag a bhfuil baint aige leis. 
     
     
        Ach, mar a dubhras inde, nilim sasta comhacht a thabhairt do na Seanadoiri a bheith pairteach i dtoghachain i gcoir an tSeanaid.  Nilim sasta comhacht a thabhairt doibh iad fein d'ath-thogha, daoine nar thaobhuigh ariamh le muinntir na tire.  Ta comhaltai orra, san tSeanad, a dhein obair mhaith ar son na hEireann.  Ach an fior e sin i dtaobh na mor-choda aca? 
     Admhuighim gur feidir obair mhaith a dheanamh taobh amuigh de chogadh agus taobh amuigh de chursai polaitiochta.  Ba choir a aithint gur obair mhaith e obair litriochta, obair cuireadoireachta, obair ealadhan agus eile.  Ta cuid de na Seanadoiri agus ta obair mhaith den tsort san deanta aca.

Ni labhrann siad amach go neamh-spleadach a chur in uil do chach an cuspoir ata againn uile, &ldquo;Eire saor Gaedhealach,&rdquo; agus beart do dheanamh do reir an chuspora san. Se sin an cuspoir ata ag furmhor na ndaine ach ni raibh furmhor an tSeanaid ar an dtaobh sin agus nil fos. Da mbeidis, bheadh a mhalairt de thuairim agam, b'fheidir, maidir leis an Seanad. 
     Deirtear linn go bhfuilimid saor sa Stat so.  Ni chreidim sin ach creideann cuid de na Teachtai e.  Iarraim orrasan toil na ndaoine do chur i bhfeidhm agus cuspoir na ndaoine do chur i bhfeidhim.  Ach is eagal liom go gcuirfear an Bille seo i bhfeidhm d'aindeoin a ndearfear in a choinnibh, is cuma ce'n argoint a cuirfear os coir na Dala so. 
     Achuingim ar na Teachtai uile an votail do dheanamh os ard i dtogha an tSeanaid.  Ni thuigim ce'n fath go ndeanfai os iseal e.  Nar choir go mbeadh de mhisneach againn go leir a thaisbeaint do mhuinntir na tire, agus don phobal Shaelach go sonnrach, ce'n fath go bhfuilimid ag tabhairt ar votai do dhaoine airithe? 
     Mar a dubhras cheana, ni ceart an comhacht so do thabhairt don tSeanad chun iad fein do thogha.  Da gcuirfeadh siad in uil duinn go bhfuil siad ar thaobh naisiuntachta no go bhfuil siad i bhfabhar Gaedhealachais, b'fheidir go mbeadh a mhalairt de thuairim agam mar gheall ar an Tigh   eile.  Ach, do reir mar thuigim an sceal, ta an furmhor aca cho laidir agus cho dian in aghaidh naisiuntachta agus in aghaidh Gaedhealachais agus a bhiodar 20 bliain o shoin.  Ma's ceart e, toil na ndaoine do chur i bhfeidhm, ba cheart comhacht do thabhairt do na daoine ata i bhfabhar na rudai seo agus gan comhacht do thabhairt do na daoine ata in a gcoinne.  Dheanfai a lan maitheasa da dtiocfadh linn aontu ar an meid sin.  Thiocfadh linn cabhru le cheile.  B'fheidir nach mbeimid ar aon intinn mar gheall ar chursai polaitiochta ach thiocfadh linn cabhru le cheile chun cuspoir na ndaoine do chur i bhfeidhm agus gan daoine do chur ar an Seanad ata in aghaidh naisiuntachta agus Gaedhealachais, ma ta Seanad le bheith ann.  Ma's rud e nach raibh ins an Chonnradh acht sli chun saoirse iomlan do bhaint amach, is feidir linn ceim ar aghaidh do thabhairt anois.  Ach, ni ceim ar aghaidh ata san mBille seo ach ceim ar gcul.  Taimid ag geilleadh, san mBille seo, do na daoine a bhi i gcoinne naisiuntachta agus nar dhubhairt fos go bhfuil a mhalairt de thuairim aca. Taimid ag tabhairt comhachta doibh, Bille a ritheadh ag an Dail seo do chur ar ath-lo go ceann tamaill fhada, agus comhacht chun chur isteach ar thoil na ndaoine.  Iarraim ar lucht leanamhna Chumann na nGaedheal gan comhacht do thabhairt do na Seanadoiri chun bheith pairteach i dtoghachain i gcoir a dTighe fein agus iarraim orra an Votail do dheanamh os ard. 
     
      
       It is with very considerable reluctance that I rise to speak on this Bill on the final Stage. It is only from a very strong and deep sense of indignation at the iniquity of the proposal that is contained in it that I do so at all.  Deputy Byrne apparently does not believe me but I can assure him it is true.  This Bill has been opposed by our Party at every single Stage which it passed in this House and at every single Stage we endeavoured to convince Deputies opposite that they were doing something for which in a few years they would be ashamed to take responsibility.  It is well to remind them even at this Stage just exactly what it is they are proposing to do.  There are many Deputies opposite who can look back   upon the history of this country for a much longer period than I can and who can get a grasp of the significance of the developments which took place within this nation in the period of their lives. 
       For the past fifty years the Irish people have been striving to shake off the grip upon the economic and political life of this country which was maintained and held by the descendants of the Plantation soldiery of Cromwell.  For fifty years the Irish people have been trying to make good their authority in this country.  For fifty years they have been trying to get into the hands of the Irish people the economic resources of the country. For fifty years they have been trying to drive out of the national life of Ireland that alien element which was introduced into it by a foreign government and given an unnatural degree of authority.  And now at the end of that period and after half a century of struggle during which every conceivable means were used by the Irish people to bring success to their cause&mdash;means constitutional and unconstitutional, means vigorous and means timorous, means, some of which failed and some of which were successful&mdash;after fifty years of such struggle we have a House of representatives, declaring themselves to be representatives of the Irish people proposing to give back into the hands of that privileged clique the power which the Irish people were endeavouring to take from them.  Let Deputies have no doubt as to what they are doing.  They will hear many big and high sounding phrases spoken in connection with these Bills but I ask Deputies to read these Bills for themselves and to grasp their significance.  The significance of this Bill is to ensure that real authority and real power in this State will be given to that privileged and selected class who have always been and always will be opposed to the interests of the Irish nation. 
     
     The purpose of this Bill is to block up every channel by which the aspirations of the Irish people can secure representation in that Second Chamber of the Oireachtas; to block up every means by which the Irish people can make their will effective in respect of   that Chamber.  By Section 1 of the Bill popular election to the Seanad is abolished.  The idea of election by the Dail is turned down, and instead of that a system is devised with amazing cunning, which is hereby proposed to be enacted, by which that institution will be empowered to ensure that the views of its present majority will always be held by the majority there, and that those who were nominated in the first instance to that House will be able by this enactment to reproduce themselves. That is the purpose of this Bill, not to regularise or implement the Constitution, not to implement the will of the Irish people, but to ensure that the privileged class at present entrenched in the Seanad will be able to hold their position there against any attack directed against them by the plain people in this country. 
     I would like to ask some of the Deputies opposite if they ever thought in their younger days that they would find themselves at this time of their lives sponsoring such a measure as this. Deputy Timothy Sheehy fought the landlord class in the County Cork. 
     
      
       You will not get him. 
     
     
      
       I think the methods of the Deputy were at times, shall I say, unconstitutional.  He certainly did his period in Limerick Jail with other good men in those days.  Did he ever think he would be sitting in a House of Irish representatives voting to put in a position of permanent power the men who were the backbone of the landlord class he was fighting on that occasion? The Minister for Local Government, I suppose&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       He would like you to figure it out. 
     
     
      
       The Minister for Local Government is so concerned with the affairs of to-day that he has completely forgotten the nobler and finer sentiments of years ago.  The Minister for Agriculture never had any nobler or finer sentiments. 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
     
      
       He is not worth arguing with.  Deputy Connolly did a period in jail, too.  Was that to enshrine the Earl of Longford in power? 
     
     
      
       Jail is one of the most comfortable places.  Do you remember the good time we had in Ballykinlar? 
     
     
      
       No, I do not.  The Minister had all the good times there. 
     
     
      
       Ballykinlar is out of order. 
     
     
      
       There are some Deputies opposite who are probably as good representatives of the landlord mentality as any person at present in the Seanad, or ever likely to be in it.  But there are some who once were not ashamed to call themselves Nationalists, even if they were not proud of it.  Perhaps Deputy John Daly will have a few words to say about his hectic youth also, but I certainly do not think there are many of them who ever thought they would see the day that they would be voting for this power to a collection of dukes and earls and British Army pensioners, such as now constitute that Assembly, and who are likely to constitute it for a considerable number of years to come.  We must consider this Bill in relation to the other Bills that accompany it, and in relation in particular to the other Bill that will be considered after this Bill is disposed of.  We are not merely altering the method of election and insuring that the will of the Irish people can have no effect in regard to that Assembly, and giving them power to reproduce themselves, but we are doubling their power to interfere with the acts of the people's representatives. That is the effect of this legislation. The Government are preparing against the evil day when the Irish people will realise exactly the game that is being played with them and give them notice to quit.  They are preparing against that day.  They do not care what happens to the Government that comes after them.  That Government will have to stand up to the Seanad, will have to break the power of the Seanad, if it wants to effect any useful legislation.  That does not concern   the President and the Government. Like Louis XVI., I think it was, on an equally historic occasion, they say: &ldquo;After me the deluge.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is historically inaccurate always. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps the Minister as the historian, will correct me.  Was it Louis XV.? 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       Was it Louis XIV? It certainly was not King Paddy.  The Government is endeavouring to provide the system of government here, which it, in common with that old Unionist section, stands to maintain, will continue, no matter what the Irish people may decide, in respect to this particular House.  It is not merely likely, but probable, that the next election will result in a majority of a different calibre being in this House than is now in it, and it is to provide for that eventuality that the Government is establishing in a position of authority, in a position which it hopes to make impregnable, the reactionary conservative section to impede and hold up the measures of their successors. 
     
     This Bill will, no doubt, pass.  The Deputies who voted for it before will crowd into the Division Lobbies and vote for it again when the bell rings, irrespective of what arguments have been advanced against it.  It will then go to the Seanad, and there is no doubt that the Seanad will pass it.  As we have pointed out before, the Seanad in this matter, in consequence of the inactivity, or, as one Deputy called it, the laziness of the Government, is in a position to dictate its own terms. This Bill proposes to alter the method of election to the Seanad, but if the Seanad choose not to like the method of election provided for here, they can hold up the Bill until the period during which the election under the old system must take place has elapsed. They can take their choice: either they will accept the Bill or they will have an election under the old system. There is no machinery in the power of the Dail to force them to adopt this   if they prefer the other.  It was part of the bargain.  I suppose the President will call it a good bargain.  Now that we have become so anxious about the dignity of the House, we cannot use words of doubtful significance. 
     
      
       Have you any smelling salts? 
     
     
      
       No.  The Bill, as I said, is one which must be considered in relation to the others which accompany it.  The powers of the Seanad are being increased.  The power to interfere directly with the legislation passed by this House is being increased in point of time.  Certain powers which were of no use to them and which they failed to avail of have been taken from them and the method of election has been altered.  I ask Deputies opposite to consider what the position of the governmental machine will be after all these Bills become Acts, to consider the Irish people governed by institutions which will then exist and unable to alter these institutions, unable to effect the repairs which will become obviously necessary after these institutions will be working for a short period with vested interests established to interfere with the rights of the Irish people to make laws on their own behalf.  It is perhaps too late to appeal to Deputies on the other side to realise that we could get on much better, more effectively and much more cheaply without any Seanad at all.  If there is to be any reconsideration of the position in relation to that body it should be to ask ourselves the question whether or not we can afford to spend £50,000 in order to enjoy the luxury of possessing it.  Go and ask the people of your constituency, many of whom are unemployed and hungry at this moment, are they prepared to spend £50,000 of the Irish people's money in order to maintain that institution. Ask them are they prepared to give to that body those additional powers which it is proposed to give them by this Bill.  There is no use for us to taunt the Government, as we did before, to get an expression of the people's will on this Bill.  The Government come here under the pretence that they are acting in consequence   of some mandate that they received at the last election, but they dare not go to the people and by Referendum or any other method get the people to say whether or not they want these Bills.  They dare not face the people on the single issue as to whether or not there should be a Seanad. 
     
     
      
       That does not arise at this stage of the Bill. The Deputy will have to be clear on that. 
     
     
      
       I agree.  The only other matter I will refer to before I conclude is a matter that I referred to on the Report Stage of this Bill.  That is the method by which the Seanad is to be elected by ballot.  It is decidedly objectionable that there should be in this House, an election carried out by the people's representatives by a secret ballot and in secrecy.  It is decidedly objectionable that Deputies here, when voting for representatives for the Second Chamber, should do so by secret ballot.  If it is not contemplated that some Deputies will be ashamed to stand over the action which they have taken in the Seanad election, then there is no reason whatever why every Deputy when voting should not sign his name at the foot of the ballot paper and leave it open for inspection.  Certainly Deputies on this side of the House, if they take any part in that election, will have no hesitation in telling their constituents whom they are voting for and why.  There must be some reason, that has not been advanced yet here, why members of the Government Party are anxious to conceal the action they will take on that occasion.  I hope that some reason will be advanced to justify that method of voting.  I hope that some member of the Government will explain to us the arguments which had convinced them that a secret ballot was necessary.  Such reasons have not been given to us yet.  The only other point in the Bill to which I have a decided objection is the title of the Bill.  The title of the Bill should be briefly recited as the reductio ad absurdum Bill or Act. 
     
     
      
       This is the Fifth Stage of this Bill, and we have heard   practically all the arguments that were made use of during the whole of the Report Stage of this Bill repeated now. Amongst others we have the allegation about consolidating the imperialistic section of the nation and so on, the landlord class, the descendants of Cromwell.  I do not know if Deputies opposite have ever read of Davis, or if they have ever heard of Griffith, that they still make use of these terms. Now what do they mean by these terms?  What is a patriot?  What is patriotism?  They evade that issue. They talk occasionally about nationalism without indicating what is their conception of nationality.  They assume to themselves the term, depicting in their own minds what is the real idealistic meaning of patriot, and what is the meaning of nationality.  What is nationality?  What is the idea of a nationalist assembly? 
     
     
      
       Does the President want to be informed on the matter? 
     
     
      
       I think an opportunity has been afforded to Deputies of doing that up to this, but they have not done so.  They spoke as if they were the repositories of nationalism. Practically every sentence they uttered, and practically every expression they used shows completely to any person, even though he be not a student of politics at all, that they have no conception of the term &ldquo;Nationalist.&rdquo;  They have no conception of the great national heroes we had in this country, and the great national authorities upon patriotism. The narrow, bigoted, useless and peculiar form that they have adopted, by using such terms, is detracting from their own country, and is out of date. It served its purpose in its own day. There was a time when one was anxious to mobilise the entire forces of the nation. 
     
     
      
       Is that day past? 
     
     
      
       I would say that it is not; I would say that there is time to mobilise these forces, but not on any narrow issues, not with a view to considering only the interests of a section in the country, and certainly not with   a view to enthroning incompetency in place of existing orders. 
     
     
      
       That is a hard one on the Minister for Agriculture. 
     
     
      
       If there is to be a change let it be for the better.  If I were in the Deputies' place opposite it would not appal me to see a majority in the Seanad opposed to us.  It would not appal me at all.  I have seen those things before, and I have seen them pass away.  I have seen a better conception of nationality developed in this country in the last few years than many people before me had ever hoped for or anticipated.  What are the facts? The facts are that in the Seanad nominations which took place six years ago there were two people of those who were present at the first Sinn Fein Convention in this country in 1905 There is not one Deputy on the Benches opposite who was present there. 
     
     
      
       The year 1905 is pretty early. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy was old enough to have been there, but apparently at that time his national eyes were not open; they have been opened since.  There are other people in the Seanad whose claims to be regarded as industrialists are superior to the claims of any of the Deputies in the Party opposite.  There are people there who, when this country required money and when national loans were needed, did all that in them lay to establish the credit of the country. 
     
     
      
       Five per cent. 
     
     
      
       Yes, and no other country in Europe has borrowed at a cheaper price, Great Britain excepted. The Deputy is certainly an adept at shoving in something to put me off my stride.  But I would suggest to Deputies opposite to consider one thing in their own interests.  They want to get rid of this Government.  That is their main objective in public life.  That is the one obstacle, but the alternative is deplorable.  No man of sense in the country would care to take the alternative position to-morrow.  &ldquo;Get rid of those fellows,&rdquo; but the ordinary man would say: &ldquo;What is the alternative?&rdquo;  The very arguments that have been adduced in opposition to these measures, those very arguments are sufficient to keep any sensible man from voting for a change.  &ldquo;That the election to the Seanad by direct vote of the people is undesirable.&rdquo;  That is something that Deputies opposite would like to take from the records of this House. 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       Not at all. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Lemass said that if I were to interpret this Bill correctly the real object of it is to block up every means by which the Irish people could make their will expressed. 
     
     
      
       In relation to the Seanad. 
     
     
      
       If I were taking up the same line as the Deputies opposite in opposition to this Bill I would not like to be responsible for what I have just quoted.  I wonder have the Deputies opposite considered the election of a Second Chamber in any other country?  Within the past few weeks I had a visit from an American judge who had a letter of introduction from a friend and supporter of the Party opposite.  He told me that our proposals in connection with the Seanad were sound and to stick to them. 
     
     
      
       He was an American on holiday. 
     
     
      
       He had only come in here for a few moments during the discussion of one of these Bills. That happens to be the opinion of an outsider.  The Deputies opposite concern themselves in most of these things first with an attitude of opposition to the Government.  I would advise them to put the Government out of their minds and just for a moment consider what their position would be if they were themselves faced with the problem of getting a body of this sort&mdash; getting a Seanad.  What is the problem that we have to deal with?  For something like fifty years a contest has gone on in this country in connection with land.  There were two parties to it.  It happened, as in connection with   many other contests of the same sort, that issues were introduced which divided the people of the country.  Adherence went to one side that would not naturally fall to that side and adherence went to the other side which would not naturally fall to it. All that is over and done with.  Those people who are now in the Seanad are of the people in this country.  They ought to be mobilised in connection with any national advancement that is needed.  During the past few years certain measures have gone from this House, measures introduced by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture who. whatever his political opinion may be, will at least get credit for the fact that he had a forward and a sensible agricultural policy.  He informed me that every one of these measures was strengthened and improved in the Seanad.  Yesterday I observed quite a number of Deputies from the benches opposite making their way to the Seanad. 
     
     
      
       Going to see the museum. 
     
     
      
       For what purpose did they go there?  Do people go to an institution they despise in order to provide themselves with arguments for its destruction?  Not at all.  The attraction, to my mind, was admiration. Even the discussion on one of the Bills there yesterday could well be taken as a headline.  I say that if we had the same class of discussion on the measure in this House as took place there, it would be for the better of this House.  The Bill was discussed in the Seanad outside of all Party affiliations, Party attachments and Party prejudices.  Let no one imagine for a moment that the accumulation of wisdom is in any Party.  This country, like every other country, requires the help of all its citizens, and it does not come within the competence of any one section of the community to pour odium or contumely on any other section. Each and every one of us is a necessary part of the existence of the State, and Deputies should consider that the very fact of these people being willing to come in and help and give their aid in the moulding of our legislation is a big step forward. 
     
     
     
      
       Is that any reason for putting them in a position of privilege? 
     
     
      
       What is the position of privilege? 
     
     
      
       Enabling them to reproduce themselves.  They are not elected. 
     
     
      
       Supposing I were to examine that particular statement and examine it in relation to the Deputy's adherents in this House, what is the position?  Let us assume for a moment that they have no right to vote&mdash;the whole of the Seanad has no right to vote.  The Deputy's Party would be responsible for the election of seven and a half Senators.  If, on the other hand, the members of the Seanad as they are at the present moment were included in the personnel, the numbers would be 5.2 per cent., so that would mean a loss in representation of one and three quarters. 
     
     
      
       Who is dealing with Parties now? 
     
     
      
       I am dealing with Parties just for the purpose of taking up the intellectual interjections, if I may say so, of the Leader of the Opposition. 
     
     
      
       The .2 per cent. is no good to anybody. 
     
     
      
       Certainly not, but the Deputy can understand that it might influence some other person in   the election of a Senator.  I will make it even money if the Deputy likes.  The fact of the matter is that it is in respect of a loss of two that we have been deluged with speeches for two hours.  Deputies on the opposite benches have laboured under extraordinary difficulties and Deputy Lemass took unto himself the shroud of every great orator of the past in order to impress Deputies on these benches with the awful consequences that will flow from the loss of two Senators by reason of the difference between his method of election and ours. 
       Might I say to Deputies opposite that there is one representative in the Seanad who was responsible for a very patriotic action in this country as far back as 1917, although at that time he occupied a position in the British Army?  The Party opposite is not free from affiliations with the British Army either, if my information be correct. Mere attachment to a particular Party does not by any means designate patriotism. In this matter, as in other matters, I would advise Deputies to broaden their minds and their outlook, to get truer conceptions of nationality and patriotism than have been given expression to in this House.  I would ask them to realise that the best interests of the country are not going to be served by the particular type of speeches that we have listened to on these and on other measures.

     CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT No. 13) BILL&mdash;FIFTH STAGE. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash;That the Bill do now pass. 
     
     
      
       It would help considerably if the President would deign to give us at the start of this discussion some argument such as he pretended to give on the final stage of the other Bill.  No. 13 is a Bill which proposes to extend the powers of the Seanad.  It proposes to extend the powers of the Seanad by making it possible for them to hold up a Bill for a longer period than they have up to the present.  We object to giving the Seanad increased powers.  The line of argument on which the President proceeded in the discussion of the last Bill can be taken up in connection with this Bill just as well as in connection with the Bill on which it was given.  I would have far more confidence in the protestations of the President if I had not likened it, in my mind, to what was said on a famous occasion when those who loved their friends were not to get much credit.  If the President was so generous when he was talking about some people who were opposed to him,   then I would begin to give him credit for his generosity, but he certainly does not get much credit from me for being generous to a Party from which he expects to get support.  He knows perfectly well that what he is trying to do by giving the power of election to the Seanad and by giving them increased powers is to strengthen his own political Party.  I think the people of the country will see very easily beyond that veil of Davis which he is trying to enshroud himself in.  There is no question on this side of not wishing to give to every Irish citizen equal rights here. When it was a question of doing one thing or another the people on this side showed it at least as well as the gentlemen on the opposite benches.  We stand for equal rights, but we do not stand for privilege.  We say that this Seanad was originally established with the idea of giving a privileged position to a certain section that they would not on account of their numbers be able to get if they were elected by the people. The method of nomination for the Seanad was intended to put them in a position they could not have secured by the votes of the people or by the votes of the people's representatives. The House to which these powers are going to be given is a House in which there are sixty members who have never to go directly for election before the people or before a body like this that would be representative directly of the people.  They are going to be elected by themselves.  I would like to know whether, if there was a proposition here that the Seanad should be allowed to co-opt members when vacancies existed, how we would face that proposition. 
     
     I feel that the Executive, in standing for these Bills, is not faithful to the people who elected them or to this Dail, and is pursuing a course the result of which is going to be at some date a much bigger clash between the two Houses than it need be otherwise and which will not be in the real interest of the section which the President pretends he is so anxious about.  There is no doubt about it, if a House such as is proposed in these Bills is set up and if the power, as proposed here, is given to it, that the day will come when that   House will be swept out of existence altogether.  If the President was genuinely anxious instead of pretending to be anxious, if he was taking a genuine national view of the question, and I use the word in the broad sense, the view that a statesman is supposed to take, he would not proceed along this line, because he knows perfectly well that he is only putting up a dam before a tide that will rise up and sweep it away.  The more the people are exasperated by this line of conduct the bigger will be the destruction when it is swept away.  I do not think that that is the right line to proceed upon. We ought to start, I think, on this basis&mdash;that every person in the country, no matter what his views in the past were, is entitled to equal rights in the country.  That is our standpoint.  But no section is entitled to any special privileges.  We hear a good deal about the majority rule. Where is the question of majority rule there, or of democracy, if this special House is to be put into a position in which it can defeat the purpose, for at least two years, of an Executive that has been elected with a certain programme? 
     Two years is a very long time, as everybody knows, to have a programme on which an Executive has been elected or on which a certain majority has been elected, kept from being put into action.  Yet this Bill gives the Seanad if it is hostile, if there is an advance in a certain direction, national or economic, which would suit this particular House, power to hold it up for two years, and there is no choice left to the Executive which has been elected on the programme that has been held up, except to go back to the country.  I promise, for our side, at any rate, and no matter who is there and who is in the position, they will go to the country for the sweeping away of that completely.  I would like to know if the interests which the President professes to serve would be better served by giving them reasonable powers or by giving them powers which no one in the country will stand for their getting.  Two years or so is the time that legislation can be held up by this Seanad.  The President was kind enough to tell us that they   had put in a few in the Seanad who had what he called a national record. Of course, they were put in.  We know always that things like that are done just to put a face on them.  These are put there in order that they might be brought out by the President or whoever wants to defend the Seanad when the position is adverted to in order that the President may come along and say: &ldquo;Oh, look at Mrs. So-and-so and Mr. So-and-so on this Seanad!&rdquo; How many are there of the sixty?  The President was not good enough to tell us that.  In the vote on issues, for instance, which were the dominant national issues for four or five years, what vote did you get in the Seanad on any one of these questions?  Was there a majority in the Seanad who would vote on the lines on which the majority of the members here would vote, at least the lines which I would say if we were to take the views and the opinions of those who sent the Deputies here would represent the majority of them?  The majority are elected here by people who have a national outlook, directly opposed to the imperialist outlook.  If there is a question of national defence as against imperialism and a vote taken on that in the Seanad to-day what way would the vote lie?  Anyhow, there has been no justification by the President at all for the methods of election.  Not one on the opposite benches attempted to defend the method of election by the Seanad and Dail combined.  Election by the Dail can be defended; election by the people can be defended, but there has been no defence for spoiling the representative character of the electors by putting in a body which are not elected at all.  The body you are going to elect now is a body which is neither fish, flesh nor good red herring, and it is to this body that you propose giving the powers of holding up Bills for two years.  Two years. Suppose in the middle of their term of office, as I pointed out here before, that Executive proposes to introduce a number of measures to carry out a programme on which they are elected. They cannot do it if this Seanad decides to hold them up.  They have to go once more to the people.  We have heard what dissatisfaction elections   give to the people, how expensive they are, and how unwise it is to have these elections unnecessarily.  This recourse to the people is unwise.  The President did not think it unwise last year to have an election overnight. 
     
      
       The Deputy did. 
     
     
      
       No.  We considered it altogether a breach of faith with the Dail as the President broke faith with another Dail.  It was a distinct breach of faith with the understanding here that we were to meet on the 11th October.  However, we can go away from that.  My objection is that you are always talking about the people.  Then you say if it suits that elections are expensive and inconvenient, that the people do not want them and now this Bill makes it impossible for any Executive to carry out its programme if it does not want to be held up for two years without recourse to the people.  As I say the President takes all this very philosophically because they are his friends. If he would put himself in the position of a person who was making a constitution, without any particular reference to his own or any other Party, who was thinking in general terms as to the powers a second House should have in relation to the first House and he found that the Seanad was to be composed, as is provided for now, as as far as the Dail is concerned I do not think he would, for a moment, stand for these provisions.  Nine months delay was in the Constitution up to this.  That was sufficient.  Why was it doubled?  Has there been a single argument put forward here any more than there was a single argument for allowing the Seanad to participate in the election?  There has been no argument brought forward here as to why the time should be doubled.  The only argument was that the Committee sat on which the Seanad again, just the same as it is going to have in the election of a Seanad, had six votes out of twelve.  In any case in which they voted together, naturally they were anxious about the interests of their own body.  I see Deputies here who are as anxious about the privileges and powers of this House as representatives of the people as the members   of the Seanad on that Committee were anxious of theirs, but this particular Committee on which the Seanad got equal representation, agreed by a majority that their powers of holding up Bills should be extended, should be doubled.  I, at least, thought when that proposition came before this House that this House, having some respect for its own powers and the people, would not consider that. 
       The Executive Council, however, adopted it because, as I have pointed out and stressed more than once, they expect that it is going to help their own friends ultimately.  There is the same alliance between the present Executive Council and the majority of the Seanad as there was between the Tories and the House of Lords in the past.  Just as every Tory measure was allowed through by the House of Lords, the Executive here expect that their measures will not be hampered, that there will be no blocking of their measures, and they hope that it will be a fruitful source of inconvenience to any other party that may come into power.  That is the secret of the broadmindedness of the President.  I have said that there has not been a single reason given as to why this period during which they could hold up Bills should be extended&mdash;not a single argument.  It was said that the period of nine months was not availed of.  If there has not been any occasion in the past in which the nine months' period was used why extend the power now and why make the period eighteen months?  I think the only argument, or rather pretence of argument, which the President put forward at some stage of this Bill was that the power of referendum was being taken away from the Seanad.  Senators themselves admitted that the power of referendum was a power which they could not use because, if they held up measures passed by the majority of the representatives here who were much more likely to be in touch with popular feeling, they would not dare to go to the people by way of referendum, so that the power of referendum was in general useless to them. 
     
     In what case is the power of referendum   being left to them?  It is being left in cases where there would be Constitutional amendments.  Why?  Again, of course, it is the broadmindedness of the President&mdash;the broadness of the Platte river.  In America they have a saying &ldquo;As broad as the Platte river and just as deep.&rdquo;  The same river is just about six inches deep, and that saying has become a proverb.  We know pretty well what the views of members opposite are.  We know them intimately.  We had reason to know them in the past and, whoever may be deceived by any pretence of that kind, we are not.  This broadmindedness is the broadmindedness of loving your friends but not the broadmindedness of loving your enemies.  It is broadmindedness expressing itself by giving a quid pro quo for the Referendum. We naturally ask ourselves to examine it.  The Referendum is being taken away in cases where it could not be used, and would not dare to be used by the Seanad, but in the one case where it was thought the Seanad might use it, in view of the history of the past four or five years, it is left to them.  Whenever there is a question of changing the Constitution or of the Irish people making any advance and stepping forward on these steppingstones which were the principal plank in the programme of the Executive when they came into power, then, of course, they want to make quite sure that the intimidation which they used so effectively for the last five or six years could be used again; then the Seanad can hold up in order that this campaign can be carried out in the country. 
     As I say, when one examines the broadmindedness of the President on matters of this kind it does not certainly go very far to convince him.  The more you examine it the more you see that there is nothing in it but mere surface.  We are opposed to this Bill. We are opposed to it because it gives those powers which we think should not be given.  We think that the only function which the second House, with its present Constitution, ought possibly get would be the function of revision, a certain amount of suspension for a short time in order that there might be reconsideration, suspension   for a period in which the Executive Council, responsible officers of the Dail, responsible for certain measures, would have an opportunity of negotiating or getting into touch with representatives of the Seanad in order to deal with the matters in difficulty.  A longer period, however, is simply designed for obstruction. It is to put into the hands of his friends the power of obstruction against those who may not politically agree with him.  That is the secret of the Bill.  We are opposed to the Bill because we think that such power should not be given.  We believe&mdash;and we tried to get an amendment to this effect passed at an earlier stage of the Bill&mdash;that a period of four months, in which the Seanad would have to declare its attitude in respect to a certain Bill, should be given, that a period after that should be fixed within which the Dail would have to take action if it proposed to pass the Bill over the head of the Seanad, but that that period should not, on the whole, extend for more than nine months. 
     If you want to use the Seanad in order to check rash action, to give time for public opinion to express itself, a period of nine months is sufficient. Again, from the point of view of the period of eighteen months as suggested here, I have pointed out that it is most unfair to any Executive or to the Dail to let the Seanad play and dally with a Bill for eighteen months without declaring its attitude.  If the majority of the Seanad dislike a certain Bill they can go a couple of stages with it and keep it suspended without letting the Dail or the Executive know what is going to be their final attitude for eighteen months.  There is to be no redress. They hold it up.  They put it through one or two stages and keep it in suspense for eighteen months without declaring their attitude towards the Bill.  Even if you are going to give eighteen months before the Dail can take action why not specify a certain part of that period of eighteen months in which the Seanad would have to declare its attitude?  Four months would be sufficient.  The President indicated that that might rush them.  I do not think so.  They ought to declare their attitude within four months and, if it was thought advisable to have a   period of suspension following, well and good.  That appeal, however, appears to have fallen on deaf ears.  As a member of the Committee which considered this matter, my belief is that when the matter came before it, and when the suggestion of eighteen months was agreed to by the majority their idea was that a certain time should elapse in which the Seanad would have to consider the Bill. 
     There is the question of the Articles of the Constitution where consideration of a Bill is provided for.  There is a reference to it and in order to make that effective you have to define what is meant by &ldquo;considering a Bill&rdquo; or in other words make it necessary for the Seanad to take action.  Certainly there has been no effort to give effect to that particular idea and that was the idea expressed in the Committee&mdash;that there was a certain period within which the Seanad would have to declare its attitude and that was to be followed by a period of suspension within which you could not take action so as to force the Bill over their heads.  There are three things here in my opinion.  There is first of all the period within which the Seanad should take action, the period for which there should be suspension, the period within which the Dail would have to take action and if these three periods were added together we get not merely twenty months but possibly thirty-two months, so that a Bill may be dallying through all its stages and finally only become law, thirty-two months after the date on which it is first sent from the Dail to the Seanad. That period is too long and I again suggest that if this were being considered by a Constitutional Assembly or by anybody who had no interest in parties, powers like that would not be given to the Seanad as it is composed at present. For these reasons, as I have already indicated, we intend opposing this Bill. 
     
      
       I have already spoken on this Bill during the all-night sitting when the House was refreshingly quiet and when there was a general atmosphere of somnolence, a kind of feeling that it did not really matter.  We have a good deal of that feeling at present. We feel that after all our struggles and speeches, a certain inevitable thing is   going to happen by reason of a certain small majority that is here.  The President feels so comfortable in his small majority that he has not even deigned to confer upon us, as I requested him on that famous occasion, when we were up all night to listen&mdash;he has not deigned to breathe those words of wisdom which he tells us are surging up in his bosom and he has not given us the benefit of the thoughts which are languishing in his breast. 
     
     
      
       To benefit mankind. 
     
     
      
       This Bill is the outcome of a bargain.  That fact has been stressed in this House, but it cannot be stressed too much, because before this Constitution Committee reported upon the necessity for giving something to the Seanad in exchange for the supposed wrong which we were doing to them, when you took away from them the power of the Initiative and the Referendum, if the House had had any idea that these two Houses were entirely separate and distinct bodies, that the Upper House was an amending body quite separate in its composition, quite separate in its interests, having an entirely different outlook in regard to its standpoint as regards legislative proposals, if we were of opinion that those two Chambers were entirely different, distinct and independent, and that the Seanad was just as independent in its way of the Executive as the Opposition on this side of the House is, we got a surprise because we discovered that this Seanad which has been in existence for so many years, which has been in the nature of a check and a block upon the Government, to hold up hasty legislation and to put in certain remedial adjustments which might have been forgotten by the Government even in their most anxious moments, even in their most beneficent measures, that this House which was supposed to be entirely independent of the Government, whose sole and only reason for existence was that it was there as a check over the Government, has apparently come down from its high pinnacle to pure Party politics. It has conducted apparently a series of negotiations with the Government   Party, and as a result of these negotiations a certain deal has been arranged. Everything is framed up most delightfully. The Committee meets under the presidency of the Ceann Comhairle, and the bargain is brought before us, not, of course, as any discreditable, patched up bargain between the Seanad and the Government Party&mdash;oh, no, not at all&mdash;but as a logical, reasonable, and perfectly good constitutional development. 
     
     
      
       May I call attention to the fact that a quorum is not present? 
     
     
      
       There is.  The Deputy may proceed. 
     
     
      
       No arguments worth speaking of have been brought forward by the Government to induce anybody on this side to believe for a moment that there is anything of permanent value to the Constitution of this country in this proposal.  I suggest that it is purely and simply a subterfuge by which the Government anticipate a possible adverse vote of the people in the future, by which they are attempting to set up, as Deputy de Valera has pointed out, a breakwater or a dam in front of what they apparently see facing them, that is, a change on the part of the people, a desire naturally to have a change of Government and a wish to try the other Party, no matter how bad the record of the other Party may have been.  That logical process, which is the foundation of Constitutional Government, is not allowed to be carried out. The will of the people which we have heard so much about, is not to be allowed to carry itself to its inevitable conclusion but we are to be tied here and there with restrictions, in one case cutting out the Referendum and with impositions, in another case, in the form of an extension of the powers of the Seanad.  The extension of their powers, remember, is not alone to extend to having a suspensory veto for a period of twenty months, but it is also to extend to the degree, which has never been heard of, I submit, in any deliberative assembly in the world before, of taking the power of the purse out of the hands of the members of this House and giving the members of the Upper House what they never had before, the right to determine whether   or not a Bill is a Money Bill and in that way to endeavour to secure control over the apportionment of the finances of the country. 
       There were two arguments used if they could be called arguments.  One was like the toleration argument which Deputy de Valera referred to, and was such an obvious, shallow idea that it is surprising that anybody could stay to listen to it, but as apparently the Government Party are content to regard it as a serious argument and as it is one of the two reasons that have been given by the President, I suppose we are naturally bound in deference to the procedure of the House, to refer to it. The other is that it is most unlikely that the Seanad will ever exercise this power which you propose to confer upon it, that it most unlikely to exercise the power, or to cause a conflict which is the same thing, because so surely as the power is exercised, so surely as the Seanad attempts to hold up practically for the entire period of office of a future Government, legislation which the Government feels they have the authority of the people behind them in carrying out, so surely will there be conflict. 
       The only argument of the President in reply to that is that it is most unlikely. It is not unlikely.  It has happened already, not alone in the British House of Lords, but in some of the Upper Houses of the British Dominions. In the eighties, I think it was in the Victorian Legislature, the Upper House, on a purely economic question, when they felt that the interests they represented were being injured in some way by proposals that were going through the Lower House, deliberately tried to hold up legislation in the manner in which it is now proposed our Seanad should be enabled to do.  All business was held up for a period, and eventually, after a struggle in which the business of the country was held up for a considerable time, victory of course lay with the Lower House. 
     
     As regards the period of reconsideration: you have done away with the Referendum and the Initiative.  You have had several general elections. You are absolutely certain that the main questions of the Constitution and   of the Treaty have had a majority of the people behind them.  It is not likely, with the Press so anxiously defending them, with such an amiable Government in office, which is conferring so many benefits upon them, that at the next election the people who have been so wise in selecting statesmen so prudent&mdash;some of them the ablest in Europe&mdash;will turn round and elect those who have been responsible for the destruction and spoliation of the country.  But if those people who have been responsible for so much misfortune in the past are able to circumvent you and beat you in the open, in an electoral battle?  Have you so little faith in the influences that are behind you, in the deep-rooted conservatism of your race, in the national apathy that is abroad at present, in the strength of the allies that you are gathering every day behind you from various quarters&mdash;allies that never were heard of in the history of our country except as being opposed to the struggle of the common people&mdash; have you so little faith in all these interests, that are gathering and have gathered behind you, that you are not prepared to leave this question of the position, the veto, and of the future of the Seanad to the open vote of the people? 
     On what occasions during the last election did Ministers tell the people that it would be one of their first acts to pass legislation enabling the Seanad to hold up Bills which pass through this House after a deliberation in which every interest and every Party and every section of the country can have its representation?  On what platform have they told the people that it is proposed to extend the powers of the Seanad in that way?  Remember that not alone are you going to give them the power to hold up legislation which would advance this country further on its way to independence, but you are giving them the power that the Upper Chamber in Victoria exercised, the power if you should at any time follow the extraordinary radical advice of Deputy O'Hanlon and proceed to set up a State bank, for example, or proceed to take charge of your currency. or to re-organise any of the other economic questions in this country which   seem to conflict with their interests, to hold up that legislation in spite of the fact that the people have sent back a Government to carry out that legislation, that a majority in this House stands for it, that it goes through all the stages of discussion here.  In spite of these facts, and, above all, of the urgent and immediate necessity that there might be for carrying such measures into immediate effect, you are now without a single shred of argument, without a single decent reason being advanced in favour of it, going to hand over power to the Seanad to hold up legislation of that character. 
     I do not think that we are going to have a Seanad here as Deputy Law attempted to suggest which will have any analogy whatever to the British House of Lords.  I do not care what panel you have or how you proceed to set it up, this future Seanad cannot in the present circumstances, with division in the national ranks, with partition present, be otherwise than a place of refuge, as the Press has so often insisted, for politicians who have ended their career in this House or outside it, who want to get a position for the next nine years, and who have sufficient influential friends to gather the requisite number of votes to enable them to get the quota to secure a seat.  If you do not accept that class, I do not think that you will be able to get from the farming or business community men with sufficient interest in political affairs prepared to give up their own business and come up here. You will not get men, especially associated with business or agriculture, who, while they would be prepared to go into the Seanad, would have the national record behind them or would have public opinion behind them by virtue of their stand during the past ten years; would have such a public opinion as would make a Deputy feel that he could honourably and straightforwardly vote for them. 
     
       Attention called to the fact that a quorum was not present.  House counted and twenty Deputies being found to be present&mdash; 
     
     
      
       You are therefore going to be driven back upon what the   Press calls the discredited politician, or you are going to have the old Unionist minority, who are largely centred around Dublin, who have a certain amount of leisure and certain interests behind them sufficiently strong to finance them for this position. You are going to have either one of these sections or the other.  I submit that it does not matter which section you have eventually represented in a predominant position in the Seanad: that that interest will not represent the ordinary Irish people.  The system of election that you have passed through this House absolutely prevents those people from saying that they have democratic sanction, either by popular election or through the votes of this House, voting alone.  You are going to have people who have no popular mandate behind them; people who not alone have no democratic sanction, but who cannot claim to have any special training. 
       As to Deputy Law's analogy between the House of Lords and the Free State Seanad, he told us the advantages of the British Second Chamber, but he failed to point out the differences.  He did not tell us that in the British Second Chamber you had trained legal men of the highest attainments, that you had diplomatists who knew the British Empire inside out. 
     
     We are going to have in this Seanad of ours neither experienced lawyers nor experienced professional men of national record.  We are going to have, as far as I can see, the old Unionist minority, just in the same way as we had them before.  We propose to give to these people all the rights that they had when there was some need for a real check upon the present Government during the past five years, when they had plenty of powers and ample opportunities to exercise these rights in holding up legislation or amending it.  We are proposing to increase their powers.  We have not got anything whatever in the record of that five years to show us that the Seanad, constituted as it was during those five years, in spite of the number of amendments that they can point to, did anything in holding up the really dangerous measures like the Public Safety Act and the Treason Act, which   threatened the liberty of the subject. We have nothing whatever to show that in their attitude towards those measures the Seanad were sufficiently independent to exercise those powers to the fullest.  In spite of the fact that it failed lamentably during the past five years, that no member of the Government Party has, as far as I know, stood up to defend it, to show what use it had been to the country, to show in what way it had amended or benefited legislation during those years, we are now asked, without a single argument of any kind, to pass this into law. 
     I submit that if you are going to do this, to continue this piecemeal changing of the Constitution, you are not going to make for the stability and security that you talk so much about. If you are going to change the Constitution, whenever the whim and caprice seize you to delete an Article here, to amend an Article there, instead of viewing the whole Constitution in relation to the future of the country, to whatever end you propose to work out the destinies of the country; if you view it in that small opportunistic manner, view the Constitution as simply a political expedient that can be changed from time to time, according as it suits the Party in power, then you are not going to make for that bedrock foundation and sense of security that is so necessary if we are to make any progress.  I suggest that the Seanad will have no special training, and will have no democratic sanction. From the very fact that they will be completely divorced from the will of the people, that the constituencies will have no control over them and the supreme feeling of freedom that the Senators will have, that they are far away and above the will of the people, that it will not be their duty to appear before constituents at any time to answer for their actions, I suggest that by giving them that power, by electing them in that way, you are simply going to set up a House which may, in the course of time, arrogate to itself powers that it could not possibly have if it had been built up on a solid democratic foundation. When you elect a body of that character, which is not aristocratic,   which has no claims in the history of the country to special representation, which did not grow up there as a natural plant in the root of the soil of Ireland, but which has been built into the Constitution in this jerry-built way; when you have a body like that going to be placed in such a powerful position that it can hold up measures for two years, and when you take into consideration that this body will have no responsibilities whatever to the Irish people, that it will never appear before them, that it will be there complete and supreme for long periods of time, I wonder are you really steering towards the harmonious working of this Constitution?  I wonder are you really working towards concord and harmony between the two Houses? 
     I submit that you are not.  If you are going to have a Seanad, you ought, in the first place, to have it elected by the people.  In the second place, you ought to have it elected in such a way that the people will have as adequate representation there as they have here. In the third place, you ought to see that the men you put in the Seanad do not belong to and are not affiliated to one political Party, but that they will place the whole interests of the country far above Party, that they will not, at a particular juncture, enter into an agreement for a  quid pro quo  between the Government Party and themselves, but that they will regard themselves as having certain obligations to all members of this House and all Parties here who have been elected directly by the people. 
     As this is probably the last opportunity which I shall have to speak on this measure, I desire to say that, in spite of the comfortable feeling, the comfortable atmosphere that the President and his Cabinet feel themselves to be in; that they have a majority, that they are going to carry all these measures, that everything will be all right, that the people will not know anything about it, that it will be all forgotten by the next election, that there is nobody to question their mandate or authority to carry out these acts: in spite of the fact that the road is plain before them and that with their majority and closure and guillotine   they can carry all these measures, they are not doing a thing which is going to be of permanent value to the country. They are not, as I said yesterday, going to put a real barrier in front of the Irish people.  If it is the will of the Irish people that has expressed itself, according to your interpretation, during the past five or six years; if that is the will of the Irish people for fuller freedom and complete fulfilment of the national aspirations of our race; if there is anything in that it will have to go forward; you cannot tie it down or bind it: you cannot dam it in that way. It is better in the long run to let every Party, every interest, in the country, especially those that have fought and struggled for a spiritual ideal, feel that this road is open; that if we cannot agree, we can agree to differ, and that, at any rate, if one Party here cannot see in the same way as another on national questions, we are going to leave the road open and are not going to impose such an impasse in the future path of our race as is proposed in this measure. 
     
      
       The House seems to be continually trembling on the verge of a quorum and the fact that sufficient interest is not aroused in members of the House to come in here is in itself sufficiently significant to point to the way in which the dignity of this House is being injured by the methods adopted by the Government.  We are left wondering what is the mind of the Government Party, what they are thinking about, and what their views are on this question.  That is a Government mystery and one is inclined to call: &ldquo;Cast out those dumb devils.&rdquo; We are left to imagine what the arguments are which are influencing them. Even the Minister for Finance has not made his own position clear.  We are left to think, perhaps, that the arguments in the back of his mind are that we are creating such a situation, playing so much into the hands of the reactionaries in the country and binding ourselves with such limitations of the powers of this House that in the end he hopes for that revolutionary situation where he will be able to go back to his original views of revolution by   violence&mdash;that kind of revolution where the bomb and the dagger will take the place of constitutional methods.  It is left entirely to our imagination as to what his arguments are and also what the arguments Deputy McDonogh may have as to why this measure should be passed. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy has referred to me.  I may tell him that I hold as good a position in this country as he does and I am as useful a citizen to the country as he is.  I do not think there is any occasion to mention Deputy McDonogh.  There is too much talk of that kind and we have stood too much of it from the other side of the House, and the sooner they drop it the better it will be for them, in my opinion. 
     
     
      
       I can assure Deputy McDonogh I am only too anxious to hear his views. 
     
     
      
       Deputy McDonogh will meet you anywhere.  It is time that this kind of blackguardism should stop.  It is pure waste of time.  The Deputy gets up after Deputy de Valera has spoken and makes an attack on me.  I am prepared to meet him here or outside the House. 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy wishes to make a speech he can do so after Deputy Little has concluded. 
     
     
      
       When there is an attack made upon me, it is only right that I should repudiate it. 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy thinks there has been a charge made against him, he will get an opportunity of replying to that in due course. 
     
     
      
       I submit entirely to your ruling. 
     
     
      
       I think this is the place to meet Deputy McDonogh.  He invites me to meet him inside or outside the House.  I invite him to speak to this Bill and to give us the reasons why he thinks the passing of this measure is going to help the economic condition of this country, in which I know he is sincerely interested.  We have great eloquence sometimes from the Government Benches.  Deputy   Sheehy, on the Government side, treats us to real oratory in this House, but he has not considered that we are worthy to hear his reasons as to why he thinks this Bill should be passed and passed so rapidly. 
     
     
      
       I have made up my mind fully upon this Bill long ago.  You may rest quite assured upon that. 
     
     
      
       I think we are entitled to know the reasons why Deputies are taking the views which they are taking. This is a deliberative assembly, and it is very careful of its own dignity, so much so that it is setting out upon new paths and forming new Standing Orders to protect its dignity. Surely we are as a dignified assembly entitled to know the reason for the path that is now chosen.  I think Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll should be invited to give her views. 
     
     
      
       I thought he was coming to me. 
     
     
      
       I invite Deputy Little to give us his own views upon this Bill. 
     
     
      
       We are in the position that we have already expressed a considerable number of our views and arguments against this Bill, and we are anxious to hear the arguments from the other side in favour of the Bill.  I think it is quite reasonable that we should be allowed to ask individual members to express their individual views.  We are anxious to hear them. We are anxious to hear the views of Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll, to know exactly how this is going to be a stepping-stone to the Republic.  The reason why the Treaty was originally accepted was that it was going to be a stepping-stone to the Republic, and this, I take it, is one of the changes in the Constitution that is going to turn this country from being what it is now into a Republic.  The arguments against this measure have been put very forcibly.  The arguments for the measure have not been put at all.  We are here actually legislating away our own powers, and not only that, but we are binding the people, not merely from the national point of view, but also from the economic point of view, because   of the way in which the Seanad is constituted.  It is not merely that the Seanad represents forces which are prejudiced against the development of national principles in this country and its advancement towards freedom, but it represents a class rather than the nation as a whole.  It represents rather the status quo than any advance towards the fuller life for the poorest classes in the community, or a better life for the workers and for the unemployed and for those who are faced with inevitable emigration.  The Seanad represents in itself a class the least sensitive to the needs of the people and they will be the greatest limitation upon the advancement of anything like real democracy in Ireland. 
       This is the last occasion when we shall have an opportunity of discussing this Bill.  It has gone through all its stages and it has gone through them in a manner that is bringing odium on Irishmen.  This whole phase has brought bitter elements of anger and hatred amongst people where up to this you had but the dying embers of the civil war.  These Bills are absolutely unnecessary and the real needs of the country are being neglected in the meantime.  The big economic questions are not being faced.  I challenge members of the Government Party, representative men and weighty men like Deputy MacDonogh and others, to state how the economic conditions of this country are going to be bettered by the passing of measures of this sort. 
     
     
      
       It is again with considerable reluctance that I rise to speak on this Bill and it is due to the fact that I feel very strongly that this Dail is taking a very hasty and very unwise action in passing a Bill without proper discussion.  We have had no justification whatsoever given by any speaker on the Government benches in support of this Bill.  I have examined the official records for the days during which the various stages of this Bill were under discussion.  I have read every speech delivered by the very few Ministers who spoke and I have been unable to find a single argument to justify the doubling of the powers of the Seanad to interfere with the legislation of this   House.  The only thing that might possibly pass as an argument was the statement made by President Cosgrave, on Second Reading, that it is no harm to give the Seanad these powers because they are not likely to use them.  That was the only thing that bore the slightest resemblance to an argument that was set up by any Minister in justification of the Bill.  If they have no justification for it or any reason for introducing it other than reasons about which they will not speak and which concerns principally the bargain they made with Senators, let them produce them now.  It is even possible that if these arguments are strong and have any weight, they may convince Deputies upon this side of the House.  We are open to conviction.  We have given very carefully, and at considerable length, our views as to why the Bill should not be passed.  We have placed our cards upon the table.  If the Government has a hand to beat ours, let them produce it.  I hope that the sense of dignity of this assembly, which has been so often emphasised of late, will compel Deputies opposite to feel that they should at least give some pretence of reason before they steam-roll a Bill of this nature through the Dail. 
     
     It is to be regretted that members of the Government Party do not appear to be sufficiently interested in the Bill to remain in the House and listen to the arguments against it.  They know they are not likely to hear any arguments for it.  They are perhaps afraid that in a sudden rush of democratic enthusiasm they may commit the tremendous indiscretion of going into the wrong lobby, with the consequent, necessary tedious explanation to the Government Whips.  Deputy McDonogh appeared to think that some injustice was done to him when he was asked to explain the reason why he was going to vote for this Bill.  He said he was as good a man as any other Deputy here.  He was right, and his vote in the Division Lobby will be as good as any vote given on these benches and will have the same effect.  But the Deputy, to my mind, exercising such an important function should not give a silent vote.  It is up to him and the constituency he represents that he should advance arguments   to justify the action that he is going to take.  I hope every Deputy on the Government benches will consider the same thing, and consider that it is due to their constituents that they should state precisely why it is that they are going to vote for this extraordinary proposal of doubling the powers of the Seanad.  Deputy John Daly has a duty to his constituents in East Cork.  That duty is not discharged when he talked about the iniquitous proceeding of which he was guilty when he was a member of a Board of Guardians. 
     
      
       Deputy Corry will tell the Deputy all these things. 
     
     
      
       Deputy John Daly is representing his constituency in Cork in a much more important matter here. 
     
     
      
       I thought it was Deputy Corry you were going to say. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is trying to put me off the track; he does not want to be nailed down, but I want to nail him down and I want him to say definitely why he is supporting this Bill, apart from the fact that the Government Whips told him to support it. Before I leave Deputy Daly and proceed to the gentleman near him, I hope that I shall get this promise that before the vote is taken on this Bill he will tell us why, in his view, the people of East Cork want these additional powers given to the Seanad.  The people of East Cork cannot be very interested in the Seanad.  If they are like the people of other parts of Ireland, they have no interest in the Seanad, and would prefer to see the Seanad abolished rather than give them an increase of power.  But if they are interested in the Seanad and concerned with the powers it exercises, there must be some good reason why their elected representative in this House is going to vote in favour of increasing these powers.  I am sure the people of West Cork, like the people of East Cork, would like to hear an explanation from Deputy Sheehy.  He is not silent when important questions are under discussion in this House.  This is one of the most important questions we ever discussed here. 
     
     
      
       This is the second occasion in this debate that Deputy   Lemass has made an attack on me. His interest in Deputy Sheehy is very great indeed&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Is the Deputy going to make a speech? 
     
     
      
       No.  I am going to reply to Deputy Lemass. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy can do that when Deputy Lemass has concluded. 
     
     
      
       By that time it will not be worth while. 
     
     
      
       We may be able to extract a promise from the Minister for Finance that he will not move the closure until Deputy Sheehy has made his statement. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Sheehy has been a long time before the public and always acted fearlessly and was always able to expound his views. 
     
     
      
       That satisfies me.  I know he is not afraid to stand for the arguments that induced him to vote for this Bill and, having made up his mind very definitely, I am sure he will tell us very definitely what were the reasons that weighed with him to vote for the Bill. 
     
     
      
       Yes, in the Division Lobby. 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy is merely going to express his views on this Bill in the Division Lobby and not in the Dail, he is doing a grave injustice to his constituents, who will be anxious to know why the man they elected is going to vote for a Bill of this nature. 
     
     
      
       They are satisfied with my action.  They sent me here to this Dail to stand up for the principles of the Government, and I am standing up for them.  I believe their policy is right, and I will stand by it. 
     
     
      
       I am sure the Deputy told the people of West Cork before he was elected that he was going to defend the Constitution. 
     
     
     
      
       It is not a week ago since they re-elected me to the County Council of Cork after 24 years.  I got a vote of confidence from my constituents, which is more than you can say. 
     
     
      
       I admit I was not elected to the Cork County Council.  I admit the honour that has been conferred upon the Deputy by being elected to the Cork County Council was much greater than when he was elected to the Dail. 
     
     
      
       My constituency elected me to this Dail.  In 1885, I was elected a member of an urban council in Cork, and I am still a member of it, and have been for the last 45 years without a break.  Has the Deputy that record? 
     
     
      
       Deputies on this side of the House have indicated, as I said, clearly and at considerable length, their views on this Bill.  My present purpose is to try to find out why the Government Party do not feel themselves competent to defend their Bill. Why are they relying upon Deputy Sheehy in the division lobby, and why do they not put up some argument in defence here?  Perhaps the leader of the second most important party in the Dail, the leader of the Farmers' Party, may have something to say about it.  I am sorry to see Deputy Heffernan is now going away. 
     
     
      
       Discretion is the better part of valour. 
     
     
      
       I am sorry Deputy Heffernan had to leave at this moment, but if there are any other members of the Farmers' Party present, I hope they will be able to find time to speak on this Bill, because they have, after all, the experience which other Deputies in this House have not had&mdash;the experience of the making of delicate arrangements.  The delicate arrangement which preceded the introduction of this Bill is, in a manner, analogous to the arrangements which preceded their association with Cumann na nGaedheal.  This Bill proposes to increase the power of the Seanad.  As I   said on the last Bill, we must consider these matters all in relation to one another. We must consider the proposal to increase the power of the Seanad in conjunction with the proposal to alter the method of election to the Seanad, and we must take into consideration at the same time all the other Bills which have been introduced here.  We have abolished democratic election; we have turned down election by the Dail.  We have instituted an extraordinary device for the purpose of procuring Senators, and, on top of that, we have the proposal to increase considerably, fully one hundred per cent., the actual powers exercised by that institution. It is an extraordinary provision.  Is there any Deputy on the Cumann na nGaedheal benches who can defend it? There are some of them who must have thought about it, surely.  Surely there is one amongst them with sufficient independence who can say that if he was convinced this proposal was wrong he would ignore the party Whips and vote against it? 
     
     
      
       They are not convinced. 
     
     
      
       I am trying to find out the one just man.  I am, as Deputy Carney says, going round like Diogenes with a lantern looking for one honest man in Cumann na nGaedheal. 
     
     
      
       They are not convinced that it is wrong. 
     
     
      
       Then they must be convinced that it is right, and if they are so convinced why do they not get up to defend it?  Perhaps if we appeal to the Whips it may not be in vain. Deputy Peadar Doyle is a man with a great record in the fight for Irish freedom, as good as anybody, up to a period. 
     
     
      
       Up to the taking of the Oath? 
     
     
      
       Up to that time.  Did he, prior to that, ever think that he would be in this House voting for a Bill to give extraordinary powers to a collection of individuals like the individuals who compose the present Seanad?  He did not, and if he did not he must have some apology to offer.  He must have some apology why he should   take this action now and thus stultify all the previous actions of his life. Perhaps Deputy White, speaking on behalf of the Waterford people, may be able to tell us why it is that the people of Waterford are anxious for this? 
     
     
      
       Now, Deputy Lemass, leave Deputy White alone.  Seven years ago Deputy White was one of the seven men who constituted the majority that carried the Treaty. 
     
     
      
       If Deputy White desires to intervene in this debate, he may do so after Deputy Lemass. 
     
     
      
       I regret that I was called away just as Deputy Lemass was giving an account of my political conduct.  Perhaps the Deputy will repeat himself. 
     
     
      
       I am sorry that Deputy White is now going away.  I was saying that Deputy Heffernan has an advantage in discussing Bills of this nature which other Deputies have not got.  He has intimate knowledge of the making of rather intricate arrangements&mdash;I do not like to call it a bargain&mdash;and as this Bill is obviously the result of a similar intricate arrangement we would be glad if Deputy Heffernan would guide us through the maze of arguments which resulted in this arrangement.  Those who have trodden similar paths before would undoubtedly be our best guides now. Deputy White informed us that he was one of the seven men responsible for the passing of the Treaty.  I wonder did Deputy White or any other Deputy who constituted that majority think when they were voting for the Treaty that six or seven years later they would be voting to give back into the hands of the same clique the power which was won from them at the time that the Treaty was being negotiated? That is the proposal contained in the Bill&mdash;to give back into the hands of the Cromwellian planter class the power which the Irish people had for fifty years been striving to take from them.  Deputy McDonogh laughs at that.  I remember in a previous debate drawing attention to a particular incident in Deputy McDonogh's past, and I hope we will not have to do it again 
     
     
     
      
       It would be better if the Deputy confined himself to the Bill. 
     
     
      
       You can draw attention to any incident in my past and I will not be ashamed of it.  I am not ashamed of anything and I would not be wasting the time of this House and the people here as you are doing. 
     
     
      
       Deputy McDonogh is the biggest and best employer in Galway, and that is what we require in this country. 
     
     
      
       I forgot about Deputy Shaw.  Perhaps Deputy Shaw will tell us why he is going to vote for this Bill? Perhaps he will tell us how industry will benefit, how employers of labour will benefit and how those interested in horse-racing are going to benefit by doubling the powers of the Seanad? 
     
     
      
       Deputy Lemass ought to be able to explain about horse-racing because he signed a pledge to vote against the betting tax, and he has been very silent on it.  He must have forgotten the pledge he signed, but I have it in my pocket at the moment. 
     
     
      
       If Deputy Shaw looks up the pledge that I signed he will find that it is very different to the pledge that was in the paper. 
     
     
      
       I have it in my pocket at the moment. 
     
     
      
       We are not dealing with the betting tax, but with something more iniquitous, and that is this Bill.  It proposes to give to a nominated, a self-producing assembly, powers to hold up for a period of twenty months Acts passed by this Dail. I want Deputy Shaw to tell us why the people of Mullingar want that Bill passed.  They must want it passed if he represents them, and if he does not represent them, then it is up to him to adopt the method that is open to all of us when we feel we have lost the confidence of our constituents.  Is Deputy Shaw prepared to state that he has the authority of the people of Westmeath for this Bill? 
     
     
     
      
       I have been asked a question&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       It would be more advisable to allow Deputy Lemass to continue. 
     
     
      
       Not merely does this Bill propose to give these immensely increased powers to the Seanad, but it proposes to do that in a manner which is very objectionable.  What that manner is I would like Deputies on the far side to find out for themselves.  I stated before&mdash;and this has no relation to the betting tax&mdash;that I would be prepared to bet that not two Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches understand this Bill.  I defy Deputy Shaw, without looking at the Bill, to tell me what it is about.  He could not, and neither could five out of the six of the Deputies on the opposite benches tell me that.  What is more, if I read the Bill for them, because of the manner in which it is worded, they would not be any wiser.  There is one sentence which occupies sixty lines without a stop.  Even President Cosgrave went off on the wrong track and began talking about the Referendum and the Initiative, and the Bill has nothing to do with either of them.  Perhaps that is the only explanation of the extraordinary silence of the benches opposite. They do not know what it is about because they do not understand it, and they have not had the moral courage to read it.  It certainly requires a considerable amount of moral courage to do so.  Anyone who gets to the first three lines will give up in despair. 
     
     If it is intended to increase the powers of the Seanad surely it could have been done in a more simple manner than is proposed here.  What happens?  The Bill is passed by the Dail; it is sent to the Seanad.  For a period of eighteen months, during which the Seanad may consider that Bill, pass it, amend it, or refuse to consider it, that Bill is with the Seanad. They may do nothing at all with the Bill for eighteen months, and, at the end of that eighteen months, if the Seanad had not considered it or passed it, or if they have passed it with amendments with which the Dail does not agree, then the Dail passes a resolution. Then the Bill goes to the   Seanad again, and for another period of two months the Seanad may consider it or may refuse to consider it or may pass it with amendments.  If the Seanad has not passed the Bill without amendment, at the end of two months, another Resolution is passed in this House.  After all that elaborate machinery has been put into operation, that Bill proceeds in its triumphal march to the Viceregal Lodge, where His Majesty's representative draws his name across it, and then it becomes law. That is the complicated and extraordinary machine set up to effect a change in the Constitution and to alter from 90 to 275 days the period during which the Seanad may hold up a Bill. That extraordinarily complicated machinery is set up, I suggest, to prevent Deputies from reading the Bill, and that machinery has been remarkably successful.  I wonder could Deputy McDonogh tell us what the remaining sections of the Bill are about?  I know he could not.  And he is going to go into the Lobby to vote for it.  He will go into the Lobby and his vote will neutralise mine. 
     
      
       Send him to the bottom of the class.  He does not know his answer. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps Deputy Heffernan can tell us.  Perhaps he can explain why this intricate machinery was considered necessary and why this extraordinary wording was considered necessary.  He will be doing a great benefit to the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, to his own party and possibly to the President, who introduced the Bill, if he will explain this Bill.  The fact remains that here we are to have an important Bill passed by Deputies who admit that they have not read it, and who admit that they do not understand it, Deputies who do not appear to be prepared to advance a single argument to justify it.  They are relying upon one or two spokesmen in their party and on the daily Press to justify what they are doing.  These are the Deputies who are so concerned about the dignity of this Assembly.  They should realise that they are not doing justice to the dignity of the Assembly by not reading and understanding that   Bill.  I do hope that before a vote is taken we will hear a half dozen speeches from members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, giving their reasons for their vote on this Bill. 
     
     
      
       Not a man stirred. 
     
     
      
       I am prepared willingly to give way to any Deputy on the opposite side who desires to give his opinions on this Bill or the reasons which actuate him in supporting it. Before forging this other link in a chain of legislation or constitutional amendments or breakages of the Constitution, there are one or two points I would like the Deputies to consider. It is a sorry spectacle to see elected representatives of the people voting away, to a certain extent, the powers of this Assembly.  I wonder if they realise the situation?  They have certainly got from the Government no cogent reasons for supporting this Bill. We were told it was something of a bargain&mdash;because certain powers were taken away from the Seanad that further powers are to be given to them. It is not right to lessen the powers of this House or to increase the powers of the Seanad, particularly as the Seanad is constituted.  The President to-day spoke of nationality.  He maintained that those in the Seanad are Irishmen as we are.  I quite agree.  They are Irishmen, too, but I would remind him that it is maintained that the Saorstat is free.  We believe it is not. 
     
     
      
       Hear, hear. 
     
     
      
       Somebody on the opposite side said &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;  I noticed in the London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; and in the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; and in other papers, a reference to Czecho-Slovakia, in which a homogeneous minority, not of the same race as the majority of that nation, wanted certain rights.  It was maintained that, it being a free country, the minority should fall in with the majority of the people in their national aspirations, and that they should get neither place nor power until they did so.  I quite agree that the members of the Seanad and those they represent are Irish.  I would like to see them getting place and power when they definitely come out and prove that they are in sympathy with the   aspirations of the Irish nation.  I presume the purpose of this freedom which some Deputies maintain we have remains the same as it was stated to be when the Treaty was passed&mdash;the realisation of a Gaelic nation, a self-contained Gaelic nation, economically free, and that the Government intends to take all steps towards realising that ideal.  Will it be asserted that they will be assisted to do so by the present Seanad?  If the majority of the members of the Seanad were actuated by these motives, I personally might change my mind in respect of and my attitude towards the Seanad.  I fear those are not their aims. 
     
     If I refer now to Deputy McDonogh I shall do so without giving offence.  We were told here a while ago that we were wasting time.  I would ask the Deputy to consider whose fault it is.  Was it our fault that these Constitution Amendment Bills were brought in here?  When our Party came into the Dail, we intended to do our level best for the economic salvation of the country and the national salvation too.  There is no urgent reason for the introduction of these measures. Most of them could have been left alone for another twelve months. There would not have been any time wasted then, and I do not consider that it is a waste of time to try to realise the result of passing measures like these.  There are many forces against the realisation of that ideal of a free Gaelic Ireland.  Some maintain we are free.  We maintain you are not free. However, the other part of the programme remains there.  Will strengthening the hands of the Seanad and increasing their powers make for a realisation of those ideals which the majority in the opposite benches held with us some years ago, and still maintain that they do hold&mdash;a Gaelic Ireland? Do they sincerely believe that increasing the powers of the Seanad will help towards the realisation of that ideal, or that that is a forward step in advance towards the realisation of our national aims?  I think if you seek first for nationality, you will get the economic salvation afterwards.  They found that elsewhere.  I am convinced of that.  We should be sorry to waste   time here talking of nationality if it injures the nation or its economic or social progress, but I am convinced that that is the first essential.  That is another reason why I oppose giving those extensive powers to the Seanad. I have no doubt they are honourable men, honest men, acting according to their lights, but, after all, their views are not the views of the majority of this nation.  In taking this step you may be wasting time and, in addition to that, I maintain you are barring the road of progress for this Irish nation; you are preventing us reaching our goal, and serious thought should be taken of that before votes are cast. 
     
      
       In what I have to say I will be very brief.  You have the same old shibboleths repeated by Deputy Fahy&mdash;economic freedom. There is no such thing as economic freedom. It is a question of degree.  There is no such thing as political freedom; it is a question of degree.  To talk about these things is merely word-chopping. He talks about national aspirations.  What national aspirations? National aspiration, I suppose, means what the people want.  That is how I should say it ought to be here defined.  The only way to find out what the people want is to ask the people, and the people have been asked five or six times what they wanted.  Perhaps five or six times is an exaggeration.  To be quite accurate, they have been asked four times what they wanted, and they stated it quite clearly.  It is not for Deputies on the other side to talk about the Seanad not being in line with national aspirations.  The Deputies on the opposite benches are not in line with national aspirations, if you are to judge by the results of the last four or five elections.  In each of these elections the Deputies went to the people and their policy was turned down each time by the people.  That is simply a fact and cannot be denied. 
     
     
      
       took the Chair. 
     
     
      
       Was it not the programme of Cumann na nGaedheal at any rate that it should be a Gaelic Ireland? 
     
     
     
      
       I do not understand what the Deputy means.  I do not want interruptions now. 
     
     
      
       Are we discussing a Gaelic Ireland? 
     
     
      
       That is drawing a red herring across the discussion.  My understanding of nationality is the plain man of the country being as free as he can be under equal law and that no outsider interferes with him.  I hope my understanding of nationality is a different one from the Deputies opposite. I think that a nation is a collection of citizens, and no nation is free unless its citizens are free, and they are not free unless they are free to go about their business and do what they want to do without undue interference from inside or any interference from outside.  There is no interference from outside at present.  I would be sorry to think that the Deputies believe what they say, because they cannot go back too quickly on what they have said when they repeat that we are not free and that there is outside interference.  If they really believe that, then it is because they are slaves in their bones. Deputy Fahy quoted from the English &ldquo;Times.&rdquo;  There is a point of view of the Deputies opposite.  They will believe what is in the English &ldquo;Times&rdquo; or in any other English paper, but they will not believe a plain Irishman.  That point of view is there, and there from the very beginning. 
     
     
      
       It was not in reference to Ireland that I quoted. 
     
     
      
       I confess I am not dealing with the Bill, but I am trying to deal with Deputy Fahy's speech. We are dealing now with political philosophy if you like. 
     
     
      
       Not even political philosophy in regard to Second Chambers. 
     
     
      
       I am trying to deal with Deputy Fahy's point.  It is not in order, but I would suggest, as this point has been raised so often, that I should be allowed to say something about it.  Deputy Fahy has been quoting the London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; and other   English papers during these debates. I have heard what Lord Birkenhead said and Winston Churchill said, and so on. 
     
     
      
       With reference to Czecho-Slovakia, not Ireland, which is a big difference. 
     
     
      
       I did not interrupt Deputy Fahy; I have heard what Winston Churchill and Lord Birkenhead said about Ireland. 
     
     
      
       Not from me. 
     
     
      
       From other Deputies on your benches during these debates. Surely Deputies on the opposite side will realise that England is a different nation and that it has its own interests. You do not realise that it has its own views. 
     
     
      
       What about the Six Counties? 
     
     
      
       I really am not making any offensive speech.  I am not trying to. 
     
     
      
       I am asking you a question. 
     
     
      
       Again I do not understand that interruption in this connection. Surely Deputies on the opposite benches realise that England is an independent country, that it is actually independent.  It is a shocking state of affairs, but it is so.  They have their own interests, their own points of view, and they fight to keep their own end up. They make statements which neither ourselves nor France nor Germany would accept, and it is for Irishmen to state the Irish point of view and to keep it up.  But we cannot complain about Lord Birkenhead, Mr. Winston Churchill or any other people.  Realise, for goodness sake, once for all, that we are independent in this country. 
     
     
      
       Portion of it. 
     
     
      
       Realise that.  That has not been realised.  And it is because we do not realise what independence is, because you have no real independence in your blood, that that is going on. 
     
     
      
       The Minister must stop using the second person. 
     
     
     
      
       I should, but I am tired listening to this sort of thing in these debates.  Surely the Deputy on the other side who is honest must realise that there can be no interference in any matter either political, economic, or social by the English with this country, that the masters are here on those benches such as they are.  If they realise that Deputies will give less attention to the sections in this country. Our business is to make every man in this country an Irishman, and it is positively disgusting to listen to sectarian and sectional attacks on certain people in this country.  It is not Sinn Fein and no one knows that better than the Deputies on the other side.  It is not and never was Sinn Fein.  There were parties in this country built up on this basis, but Sinn Fein superseded them.  Here we are back to that state of affairs again.  For the sake of scoring points Deputies attack sections in this country.  Remember you are never going to make this country anything unless you make every man in the country an Irishman.  Remember if you are afraid of a small minority in this country, if you are afraid to give them fair play the sooner you hand over the country to them the better.  No section in this country has ever got more than fair play and never will, and no section will ever get less.  That is my political philosophy.  It will never get less and never get more.  I am not a bit afraid to give, what you call, Unionists full rights and full fair play and full representation. And I go further and say that they have brought brains, ability, energy, enthusiasm and money to this country.  Some Deputy stated that there never was a Bill brought to the Seanad that was improved.  When I remember all the nonsense that was talked by Deputies who never were able to discuss a technical Bill, and when I remember what the people you call Southern Unionists have done for Bills like the Dairy Produce Bill, the Livestock Breeding Bill, the Land Bill; how they have improved them in detail, remedied defects in them; how they have carried out honestly and sincerely the function of a Second Chamber and when I hear these people casually and lightly referred to as anti-Irish and   having no understanding of the national aspirations of the country, what am I to say?  Suppose they are not Gaelic Leaguers.  There are a lot of people here who are not Gaelic Leaguers. 
     
     
      
       I did not ask them to be. 
     
     
      
       Supposing they have not Deputy Fahy's mind&mdash;I am not making any suggestion here against Deputy Fahy&mdash;supposing they have not Deputy Fahy's conception of the Gaelic State what do you think is going to change their minds?  To show that a Gaelic State can not only be Gaelic but efficient. 
     
     
      
       Certainly. 
     
     
      
       That is the thing; that is the only way to do it.  Nothing succeeds like success.  I want to see a Gaelic State built up here honestly and you will never get everyone in the country to realise what a Gaelic State might be until the plain Irish people make a success of it and stop talking about politics and about issues that are absolutely unreal.  Really when I see all these debates and all the obstruction, when all the talk is stopped, when Deputy Flinn is forgotten with all his drivel. 
     
     
      
       He is not here. 
     
     
      
       I am sorry he is not in the Dail.  I quoted him as the worst and most insincere sinner.  When all that sort of thing is forgotten the one thing that will stand out of all this obstruction is that during all this time and all this opposition to these Constitution Bills there was an attack made on the conception of Irish nationalism that Wolfe Tone, Davis, Mitchel and every man who was worth anything in this country stood for. 
     
     
      
       rose. 
     
     
      
       I hope we are going to begin to debate the Bill. 
     
     
      
       I am going to try to reply to the speech made by the Minister. 
     
     
      
       You got your innings. 
     
     
     
      
       I think we will have to have a debate on this Bill.  The Minister told me he was replying to Deputy Fahy.  I think we will have to come back to the Bill. 
     
     
      
       Since they have given us so very few arguments to reply to you certainly cannot restrict us and allow the few statements that have been made to go unanswered. 
     
     
      
       The statement the Minister made did not seem to be on the Bill at all, except some of his concluding remarks. 
     
     
      
       I submit then with all due respect to you that on one occasion I had to sit down because the Chair judged that the remarks I was making were not pertinent to the Bill. The Minister has spoken and attacked us and I think we ought to be permitted to answer him. 
     
     
      
       The Minister's plea was that he was answering Deputy Fahy. 
     
     
      
       You were absent when Deputy Fahy was speaking.  The Minister did not answer one single point he made. 
     
     
      
       I would not expect the Deputy to agree with the Minister. 
     
     
      
       In fair play&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       I am not going to enter into a debate on this general question.  It is impossible.  I will hear Deputy MacEntee. 
     
     
      
       We have got to confine ourselves to the Constitution amendments now under discussion.  I think that the basis of the Minister's argument was that we had political freedom and such a measure of economic freedom as any other country enjoyed. With reference to that I wish to say this: that the purpose of this amendment is, and it cannot be denied on the face of it, to increase the powers of the Seanad.  The Seanad already has power to hold up legislation considered by this House, considered by the Opposition of this House in the   light of the intellect with which they have been endowed, and also in the light of the experience of the past two or three weeks.  It will be foolish for us to assert that every member of this House has considered legislation in that way.  The members who sit on the opposite benches, as the experience of this debate has shown, receive these little green papers as if they were the inspired writings of saints and sages, and never once ventured to criticise or propose any amendment or in any way to better or improve them.  They did not rely when considering the legislative proposals of this Government on their intellect or tongues; they rely on their feet to pass them through.  It is the weary feet tramping up these stairs under the control of Deputy Peadar Doyle and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, those weary feet are the things that make the laws for the people of this country, not the brains, not the intellect, not the great business capacity, for example, of Deputy McDonogh or the political experience of Deputy Daly, not the agricultural knowledge of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, but the weary feet tramping up these division stairs, up to these lobbies through the twenty-four hours of a single day&mdash; it was these passed these important Constitution amendments through their most important stages.  To leave that on one side, and to meet the Minister for Agriculture upon his own ground to consider this question that we are supposed to have political freedom, and that in order to secure that political freedom we have introduced amendments, and are considering an amendment which proposes to increase the powers already vested in the Seanad, the powers to hold up legislation which has passed through all its stages in this House.  That legislation may be good in the opinion of some people.  It may be bad, but whether it is good or whether it is bad, how is it going to be improved if it is bad; how is it going to be altered for the benefit and advantage of this people if it is bad by allowing the Seanad to hold it up, as it can do in certain circumstances, for a period of thirty-two months?  What virtue is in that delay? 
     
     
        The Minister for Lands and Agriculture is a very astute debater. Deputy Lemass challenged, I think, almost by name every single representative on the Government benches to justify that principle of delay.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture is the only one who has spoken from the Government benches since that challenge was thrown out.  Did he say one word to justify giving to the Seanad power to hold up legislation passed by this Dail, legislation which may be, and I am sure it is, introduced by a responsible Government dependent on the votes of these people, anxious to please these people, and to secure a majority at the next general election, legislation which the Government must believe to be to the advantage of the people?  Did the Minister for Lands and Agriculture give a single reason why legislation of that nature should be held up by the Seanad for thirty-two months?  You all heard his speech.  I ask you to recollect it.  Turn it over in your minds. Was there one single reason, and he is the only member on the Government benches, with the exception of the President, who has yet spoken in respect of this measure. 
     
      
       The Deputy is mistaken. I have spoken twice in support of this measure. 
     
     
      
       I am afraid the Deputy anticipates me.  I know that the portfolio for External Affairs is still vacant, but I do not think the Deputy is yet a member of the Government.  I was referring to the members of the Executive Council, the controlling heads of the political Robots on the other side who vote. 
     
     
      
       We heard all that before. 
     
     
      
       I know you have, but you could not hear it too often. There are people in this Chamber who never heard it, and are now hearing us &mdash;this despised Opposition who waste time&mdash;challenging the Government to tell the Deputies who are here and the people who are here and can hear them what are the great reasons of State that have compelled the Executive Council, deriving its authority mainly from this body, to extend and to increase   the powers of another House. That is the question that we are asking and that is the question that has not been answered since these Constitution amendments were introduced.  We are told to stop talking and to drop politics. Who started the talking about politics? Who was it that introduced these measures into this House, when all the parties in this House&mdash;the Opposition Benches, the Deputies who sit on the Labour Benches, and the Deputies who sit on the Government Benches&mdash; were considering the Finance Bill? You can look back and read the debates upon that measure.  You will see that not once did the element of Party enter into them, and the proposals which were first put forward from these benches on their merits received the sympathetic consideration of the Minister for Finance, that in fact as a result of certain amendments which were introduced it was proposed to set up a Departmental Committee to consider the whole question of the income tax.  That was the feeling and that was the atmosphere that existed in this House when these green apples of discord were thrown in.  That was the way we were approaching the condition of the State and considering the position of the country.  Every Party in this House was anxiously co-operating for the benefit of the whole community.  Then suddenly without any warning all that ceased.  The Government, which includes a Minister who wants us to stop talking and to drop politics, introduced these political issues which have created ill-feeling in this House, that I believe, has not existed&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Who tried to introduce a petition? 
     
     
      
       Who killed Cock Robin? 
     
     
      
       I think you would get possibly an intelligent reply to that very intelligent question from the Deputies who sit opposite, but I do not think it is at all pertinent to this debate. 
     
     
      
       This debate is hardly pertinent to this Bill. 
     
     
      
       I would like the Deputy not to be impertinent in making interruptions that are not pertinent.   What is the necessity and what is the urgency of these measures?  We have here on the Orders for the Day something like 20 proposals for legislation; we have the Estimates for certain very important Departments, including the Votes for Primary Education, Secondary Education, Technical Instruction, Science and Art, Agriculture, Advances to Agricultural Credit Societies, Public Works and Buildings, Relief Schemes, the Garda Siochana.  Supreme Court and Public Record Office.  I would like the Minister who wants us to stop talking and to drop politics to explain to the people how it is that every one of these Votes which were on the Order Paper before a single one of these Bills was introduced and should have precedence in the ordinary course of events have been removed from item No. 2 in the Order Paper to No. 23.  Will he explain that to the people whom he is urging to stop talking and to drop politics?  Will he explain why it is that the real business of the nation was displaced from its position of precedence on the Order Paper to the end of the Order Paper? 
     
     
      
       A debate like this on the Fifth Stage is absurd. 
     
     
      
       And at the end of it all, while we are discussing this Bill, and while the President to-day has given it priority over other measures, there still remain on the Order Paper the Second Stage of the Agricultural Credits Bill, 1928, a Bill in which the Minister has a particular and personal interest.  There is the Creamery Bill, 1928, down for Second Stage; there is the Bodies Corporate Bill down for the Fifth Stage; there is the Local Authorities (Mutual Insurance) Bill down for Committee Stage; there is the Trade Loans (Guarantee) (Amendment) Bill, 1928, down for Second Stage; there is the Cork City Management Bill down for Second Stage; and there is the Arterial Drainage (Minor Schemes) Bill from the Seanad.  I would ask any Deputy, and those who are not Deputies, but who are here, whether such Bills are the real business of this Assembly, or whether the business of the Assembly is concerned   with the Bills we are now discussing and upon which, though the President knew there would be a prolonged discussion, he gave precedence to them over the other Bills which affect the lives of the people.  The Creamery Bill will do something to improve agriculture. The Agricultural Credit Bill will do something to improve agriculture but what benefit will any farmer working on the land, toiling and slaving to pay land annuities, derive from the Constitution (Amendment No. 13) Bill?  It is an ill-omened number and and ill-omened Bill. 
     
     
      
       I think that the Deputy should sit down and not talk nonsense. 
     
     
      
       I think after I have sat down the Minister will not urge me any more to drop politics and to talk business.  I am talking business, and I would ask him to explain why he gave precedence to politics over business, as he is charged with the particular care of the farmer and agriculturalist in this House.  What great overriding advantages are the farmers of this country going to derive from the Constitution (Amendment) Bill No. 13, so that it must get priority and precedence over the Agricultural Credit Bill and the Creamery Bill?  The President, I hope, will reply.  If the Minister for Lands and Agriculture cannot address himself to that question, I would like the President to do so.  After all, we are entitled&mdash;not only we, but others who are here&mdash;to have an answer to that.  &ldquo;Give them fair play.  Give them no more and no less.&rdquo;  The Minister said that that is his attitude towards the minority. That is our attitude, only we practise what we preach, and we do not tell the people that we believe in giving them fair play, neither more nor less, and at the same time give additional power to that particular section of the people who never gave this country fair play, who cleared the land when tillage farming became unprofitable, herded the people in coffin ships, and sent them across the sea in thousands. Give them fair play, equal rights, but no more.  Give fair play to the ascendancy, the ascendancy which they enjoyed by being the instrument   of a foreign Throne in this country, and we who claim the powers of citizens should give them the same powers as the commonest and lowliest citizen amongst us, neither more nor less. 
       This Bill proposes to give them more, to give them power which this House itself does not possess.  It gives them power to hold up legislation that has been passed by this House for thirty-two months.  This Dail cannot do that. If legislation were held up during that time it would have to be introduced again, but the Seanad, who are to get no more nor no less power, can so control every act of this House that any single law passed by the representatives of the people which displeases the Seanad, whether it be for the advantage or disadvantage of the people, can be held up for thirty-two months.  Will the President, in accordance with the principle which the Minister has adopted of giving them equal power, no more and no less, justify the provisions of this Bill?  I ask again what is the advantage of that delay?  There was some use in it when the Referendum still remained in the Constitution.  There was some reason then for holding up legislation until such time as a substantial section in the Dail or in the Seanad wish to refer the proposed legislation to the people, in order to have their final voice in the matter.  Then there was some reason for giving to the Seanad power to hold up legislation, but only for a reasonable period to enable the Referendum to be taken.  The Referendum has, however, disappeared.  The Seanad did not want it, because they did not know the use of it.  The Dail did not want it, at least, the majority Party in the Dail did not want it, because they did not even exercise their political intelligence to consider how important a weapon that Referendum was and what a safeguard it was to the common people.  Now it is thrown aside and it cannot be used. 
     
     What is the use of giving to the Seanad power to hold up legislation? If the necessity for suspension arose from the fact that contentious legislation was to be referred to the people in order that they might finally declare their will upon it, then there was some reason for giving the Seanad power to hold up legislation.  It is not, however,   proposed to refer the matter to the people.  The proper, commonsense, expeditious and businesslike method to adopt is that when you have made up your mind that a thing is right, put it into force.  Shun delays.  That would have been more or less in accordance with the practice of the Government. They could not brook discussion on these Bills.  They were so urgent that they had to be rushed through, though it is not clear what profit any one of these proposals which have been before the House for the past month is going to give to the Irish people.  Notwithstanding that, they are so important they are to be rushed through this House and through the Seanad.  When some other measures come along, possibly to develop our agricultural industry or some other matter that affects the bread and butter and the everyday lives of our people, they will be held up by the Seanad for thirty-two months. I ask any Deputies who have charge of any business is that the way they would run it?  They tell us that all the great business capacity in the country is concentrated on the Front Bench.  There are some men here who by their own intelligence, efforts and ability have built up substantial fortunes, and I ask them is that the way that they won success and competence for themselves, namely, that when they knew that a certain project was right and, having made up their minds to go on with it, they went only half-way and then decided that it was better to hold it up for thirty-two months? 
     I do not know whether I get the Minister for Lands and Agriculture aright, but if my ears serve me, I think he is prompting the President to apply the closure.  I hope so, because then the people who are here will realise what the closure means, and they will realise&mdash;&mdash; 
     
      
       The Deputy cannot discuss the closure.  He must keep to the Bill. 
     
     
      
       For the Deputy's information I might state that I was discussing the Agricultural Credit Bill with the Minister. 
     
     
      
       I apologise to the Minister and I withdraw.  In regard   to this proposal the Minister for Lands and Agriculture at least enunciated one very commonsense principle.  He asked how they were to know what the people want.  He said that political freedom is what the people want. &ldquo;How do we know what the people want?&rdquo; I think, if these are his exact words, that the way to find out what the people want is to ask them.  I suggest to the Minister that that is a very good principle, and that was the principle contained in Article 47 of the Constitution which, now under the operation of Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, is due to disappear.  I ask the Minister, in view of the principle which he himself has expounded in this House and in view of the advice which he has given us that the only way to find out is to ask them, will they ask them whether they want Constitution (Amendment No. 13) Bill or not? 
     
     
      
       The answer is in the negative. 
     
     
      
       I do not want to say that that is satisfactory, but it is certainly very illuminating. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is delighted to get it. 
     
     
      
       I am not.  As a matter of fact, I heard the answer with regret, because I know this Party would derive considerable advantage if the people were asked whether they wanted this Constitution (Amendment No. 13) Bill or any of the Bills which the Government has introduced during the past few weeks.  The Government knows that this Party would derive that advantage, and that is why they give pride of place to Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, which prevented us from forcing the Government to refer these Constitution Amendment Bills to the people. 
     
     Though the Minister says &ldquo;no&rdquo; and though we might be expected to hear that answer with some pleasure, I say that we hear it with very great regret. We are very anxious to take these measures before the people.  We are anxious to hear what they want, but the Minister who told us that that was   the proper way, was very anxious to keep the people from letting us know what they want.  The one thing the Government is concerned about is to prevent us asking the people. 
     The Minister said something about economic freedom.  I will put it the other way, and say freedom to develop economically.  That is what we are supposed to have.  To the fullest extent of our power, we are supposed to have freedom to develop economically under this Constitution which he is now amending, and I presume that if there was anything in the Constitution which would prevent us developing economically, that would in any way restrict our economic development&mdash;I hope the Minister is listening, even though I do bore him&mdash;I hope if there is anything in the Constitution which would prevent us developing economically that the Minister will introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution so as to remove that restriction and to give the people that power which he referred to. 
     
      
       Certainly. 
     
     
      
       I take that as a pledge from the Minister. 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       &mdash;almost as binding as the pledge which the President alleged he gave to the whole electorate of Ireland when in one obscure sentence in a political harrangue during the election campaign in Cork, he pledged his Party to remove Articles 47 and 48. I take it that the pledge which the Minister has given me is as binding as that. 
     
     
      
       Even more binding if possible. 
     
     
      
       And  is even further away from this Bill, too. 
     
     
      
       I would ask the Ceann Comhairle to remember that there was some discussion about economic freedom. 
     
     
      
       Which only took ten minutes at most. 
     
     
      
       That may be true. 
     
     
      
       Does the Deputy ever get tired? 
     
     
     
      
       If the Minister, who is usually so prolix and who is usually so well-furnished with very specious reasons for any proposal he supports, was in this particular instance so brief and terse, it must be that he was barren of any argument which could justify this proposal.  He has, himself, referred to the fact that under this Constitution we have economic freedom, and as I suppose, by virtue of this Bill, we will enjoy increased economic freedom, and as he has now pledged himself to increase that economic freedom if I can show him how he can do it by amending the Constitution, I might quote the following for him:&mdash;&ldquo;That submarine cables shall not be landed or wireless stations for communications with places outside Ireland be established except by agreement with the British Government.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       The Deputy will agree that submarine cables are too far away. 
     
     
      
       I have the most profound convictions in regard to that. 
     
     
      
       Submarine cables are too far away from Constitution (Amendment No. 13) Bill. 
     
     
      
       They are closely associated with economic freedom.  I think, as a matter of fact, that as long as such a provision as that remains in the Constitution nobody can get up in this House and say that we enjoy economic freedom or that we have freedom to develop economically.  There are other restrictions which prevent the free development of this country, other restrictions in that Constitution, and I would like the Minister to fulfil his pledge in respect of at least this one of them. 
     
     
      
       I think it is due to you, sir, to make a fervent promise never to make a speech again. 
     
     
      
       It is not the first time you said too much. 
     
     
      
       After that confession, will the Deputy come to the Bill? 
     
     
      
       I have been dealing with the Bill.  I have been dealing with the only reasons put forward in this   debate.  If reasons are put forward I am entitled to consider these reasons even if they should be flimsy and unsubstantial, and even though I should appear to wander from the Bill.  Even though the arguments should be so flimsy and unsubstantial as those advanced in favour of the Bill, I am entitled to answer them. 
     
     
      
       I withdraw every one of them. 
     
     
      
       Well, as the Bill now before the House stands unjustified, I will leave this unjustified and unjustifiable measure to the judgment of any intellects on the Government Benches which are not yet dormant and I will ask them, in considering this Bill, to consider it with their heads and not to decide it with their feet. 
     
     
      
       The speeches which have been made against this Bill satisfy me that it is a very sensible measure&mdash;a particularly sensible measure.  I have taken down the words of the leader of the Opposition.  I have here extracts from his statement and they do not impress me.  The first is &ldquo;to strengthen his own party.&rdquo;  That was one of the allegations in connection with this measure.  The second was that it was &ldquo;going ultimately to be a benefit to their friends.&rdquo;  The third statement, which is perhaps the most illuminating of the whole lot is, &ldquo;the same alliance exists here as exists in England between the Tories and the House of Lords.&rdquo;  I will make a present of that very inaccurate statement to that Deputy.  As I said before, these statements show that the slave mind is still active.  It is in every member of his Party who addressed himself to this measure.  That slave mind seeks to bring again before the people of this country the differences of the last thirty or forty years.  It seeks to bring their minds back to the suggestion that they are not now a politically free people, free to express their own views in whatever way they wish.  &ldquo;And I go on to say that by reason of this measure a conflict between the two Houses is going to be inevitable.&rdquo;  A popular Government returned here is going to have its legislative proposal   held up by the Seanad.  Just picture the spectacle of a popularly-elected Dail sending up legislative proposals and having them rejected by the Seanad.  Just think of that.  Are there people in the Seanad who would, in a case like that, stand between the people and the laws that ought to be passed for them?  Are there people who would have a right to say that they should not be swept away?  More of the slave mind.  Deputy de Valera eternally sees some obstacle that he is unequal to, that he is unable to combat and unable to overcome.  No member of the Seanad stands for the right to come between the people and what they want.  No member of the Seanad that I have heard of stands for that&mdash;except those who support the Deputy in the Seanad. 
     
     
      
       What are those powers for? 
     
     
      
       The Deputy who last spoke gave perhaps the most lucid explanation of the utter incapacity of that party to understand this measure. The Seanad, he says, can hold up legislation for thirty-two months.  What are the facts?  Do the Deputies understand them?  I thought I had made it plain, more than once, that a measure can be held up for eighteen months; after sixty days, if the Dail passes a   resolution, that measure becomes law, unless with the consent of the Dail it be held up for twelve months longer. But if the Dail so desires, it can be held up for no longer period than twenty months.  The Deputy who is so very fond of appealing to the people and who is so anxious to show that he stands for the people, will know, if he examines the Constitution, with those amendments even, that if he, with his party behind him and the people in the country supporting him, were in this place he could deal with a situation like that, if he had the courage to face up to it, the moral courage and the physical courage to face up to it&mdash;the moral courage and the physical courage that that party lacks.  Those are the essentials with which you must face those problems. 
     
     
      
       Who is looking for catastrophic methods now? 
     
     
      
       These are not catastrophic methods.  No member of the Seanad would stand for that.  They have a greater conception of political and economic freedom than the whole party of fifty-seven Deputies there. 
     
     
      
       That is amazing and unconstitutional.

     Question declared carried. 
     Message to be sent to the Seanad accordingly. 
   
   
     AGRICULTURAL CREDIT BILL, 1928&mdash;SECOND STAGE (RESUMED). 
     Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; 
     
      
       I wonder if the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will agree to finish his Second Reading Speech?  I think it was recognised yesterday that he cut his speech short in the expectation that a division would be taken before private Deputies' business. There are a great many points that still require explanation, and, if I may respectfully make the suggestion, I think he should resume his speech. 
     
     
      
       Am I to take it that the Minister should be permitted to intervene again, but not to conclude? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       If the Minister so desires, certainly. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps the best thing I could do would be to explain the Bill by sections and point out just what it means. 
     
     
      
       Personally, I would like to have some explanation as to the amount of injustice that this Bill is going to do.  It is a case of striking a balance between the advantage that would be gained by making the Agricultural Credit Act more effective and the injustice that will accrue to certain people. 
     
     
      
       That is correct. 
     
     
      
       There would be in many cases an injustice to children and other helpless people, and while we are all enthusiastic to see the Agricultural   Credit Act functioning, I do not think we should blindly take any action that would have the effect of inflicting great injustice. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is correct. It does strike a balance.  I presume everyone understands the effect of the Bill.  It is, shortly, that a mortgage in favour of the Agricultural Credit Corporation shall have priority over equities.  That is understood and that is in the second section. The third section is one which is rather complicated and it is a section in connection with which Deputy Ryan asked for an explanation last night.  As, in fact, it is definitely on the point that Deputy Moore raised, perhaps I had better read the section.  First of all, let us see what is the definition of &ldquo;permanent improvement charge&rdquo;:&mdash; 
       the expression &ldquo;permanent improvement charge&rdquo; means a priority charge in respect of which it is shown by the mortgagor that the principal sum secured by such charge was advanced by the Corporation solely for the purpose of constructing buildings on the land the subject of such charge or for the purpose of making on such land improvements of a permanent character calculated to increase or facilitate or conduce to the increase of the productivity of such land and that the said principal sum was actually expended wholly for one or more of those purposes. 
     
     That defines &ldquo;permanent improvement charge.&rdquo;  That is for the purpose of increasing the permanent productivity of the land.  It is money spent for a purpose which would be to the advantage, not only of the registered owner, but of anybody who has any claims against the land.  It is a permanent charge and it will permanently increase the value of the lands.  Now, Section 3 sets out: &ldquo;A priority charge which is not a permanent improvement charge&rdquo;&mdash;that is, something which will not improve the land, a loan for the registered owner&mdash;&ldquo;shall as between the mortgagor&rdquo;&mdash;that is the person who gets the loan&mdash;&ldquo;by whom such charge was given and equitable claimants&rdquo;&mdash;that is, brothers and sisters who have   equities against the land&mdash;&ldquo;(other than such mortgagor) against land affected by such charge be deemed to be charged on all and every (if any) estate and interest in such land to which such mortgagor was at the date of the registration of such charge or becomes at any time thereafter beneficially entitled in indemnification of all equitable claims against such land by equitable claimants other than such mortgagor.&rdquo; 
     That is the first section that protects the parties whom Deputy Moore mentions. Deputy Moore is right when he says that there are various interests in land.  There is the interest of the registered owner and the interest of the equitable claimants.  The equitable claimants in the case of a small farmer are generally a brother and sister.  It is provided in the section that if a registered owner gets money for a purpose which does not lead to the permanent improvement of the land and if the land is afterwards sold by the bank or corporation, the corporation of course takes its charge out of the whole purchase money.  On the other hand, each of the equitable claimants have a right to claim against the interest of the registered owner for that amount.  That is the first safeguard.  The second safeguard is in respect of minors, children and lunaties.  That is dealt with in Section 4, which says:&mdash;&ldquo;...where registered land is subject to a priority charge which is not a permanent improvement charge...&rdquo;  Where there is a permanent improvement charge, there is no need to make such distinction, because if the land is permanently improved it means that if the land is sold by the courts there is a bigger price because of the fact that it is drained, and there are better buildings on it, and all parties will benefit by that. So there is no occasion to give them any particular rights in that case, and the same distinction is made exactly in Section 4.  It says:&mdash; 
     (1)  Where registered land is subject to a priority charge which is not a permanent improvement charge and a person entitled at the date of the registration of such charge to an equitable claim against such land is at the date of such registration under the age of twenty-one years,   or of unsound mind, such person shall be entitled at any time after such registration, but, in the case of a person under the age of twenty-one years at the time of such registration, not after he attains the age of twenty-five years to obtain from the Circuit Court an order that the mortgagor do, by giving security, lodgment of money in court or such other means as shall be approved of by the court, give to such person an indemnity which in the opinion of the court adequately protects the equitable claim of such person against the said priority charge, and that in default of the mortgagor giving such indemnity within three months after the date of such order the said registered land be sold by the court and the proceeds of such sale be applied according to law and that in any event the costs of such person in relation to such order, the application therefor and all proceedings thereunder when taxed as between solicitor and client be paid by the mortgagor. 
     That is the second safeguard for the equitable claimant.  An equitable claimant can always apply to the Court to have his rights liquidated and in the long run can see that the land is sold, liquidated, that money is paid for it, and that the money is divided between himself and the registered owner, but an alternative procedure is provided for him here.  He can go to the court and ask the court to make an order that the registered owner, instead of selling the land shall lodge in court securities which will cover the amount due to the equitable claimant out of the land.  That is not very much of a safeguard.  It is up to a point.  It simply gives the equitable claimant an alternative.  It does not take away any rights which he might have in law as the law stands to come to a court and have the estate administered, sold out, realised and the proceeds distributed in accordance with the equitable claims.  It does not take them away, but these are rights which a brother or sister for several reasons are slow to exercise.  They do not want to exercise them for one hundred and one reasons.  It may be the wrong time to sell and there are a   great many other points of view.  Anyway, they are rights which a brother or sister does not care to exercise sometimes. This is of some value; it gives them a right to go to the court and ask the judge to make an order that securities are lodged in court sufficient to cover the amount of the claim rightly due to the equitable claimant and in default of that to have the lands sold.  These are the only safeguards we can suggest for equitable claimants.  They are of some value especially the safeguard in Section 3. It does in fact mean when you take this into account that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will not lend more than 50 per cent. of the value of the land stocked.  They never lend more than 50 per cent. of the value of the security.  When you realise that the amount they lend is always less than the total value of the security, in fact never any more than 50 per cent. of the security which is the value of the land and when you realise that equitable claimants have a claim against all the interest of the mortgagor then you can see in Section 3 which gives them that right that they have a very considerable safeguard. 
     Certainly, in most cases, in view of the fact that the Agricultural Credit Corporation never make a loan which is more than 50 per cent. of the total value of the land, they are fairly well safeguarded. But there is this other consideration to be taken into account, and this is the practical thing.  All small farmers are registered subject to equities, but in 90 per cent. of cases there are in fact no equities that would in the ordinary way even be enforced. There are, of course, certain cases where people have gone to America and never came back.  They are equitable claimants, because they were left some time before.  Their father died intestate, but in fact they never claimed, but they can take it if they come back.  I am probably speaking to persons who know far more than I do about this question. 
     With regard to the Local Registration of Titles Office, in at least 90 per cent. of cases there are no equities that would ever be enforced, so you are left with the ten per cent., and we have tried to safeguard that ten per cent. in this way. 
     
        The Agricultural Credit Corporation are up against this difficulty, that although it is no injustice whatever in 90 per cent. of cases to get priority for their mortgages over equities, nevertheless as the law stands they cannot get that, and as they cannot get it, and as there is no feasible alternative, their operations are entirely held up.  There is no feasible alternative, because it is too costly and slow to ask the small farmers to discharge the equities.  It costs anything from £5 to £25 to discharge the equities, according to the size of the holding and other circumstances which are entirely different circumstances.  In a small holding it might be very hard to discharge equities.  There will be intestacies. People far away, people whose addresses could not be found, and so on.  The Deputy may take it that the cost of discharging equities is anything from £5 to £25, and always entails great delay.  There is no alternative to discharging equities.  The small farmer cannot afford to spend £5 to £25 until the equities are discharged and cannot afford to wait.  Therefore, there is no alternative except this, and either this right is to be given to the mortgagors or the Agricultural Corporation.  This is a right which does not, in fact, affect the equities of 90 per cent. of the holdings, and that is the opinion of the Registration of Title Office.  These considerations apply especially to small farmers, but do not apply to anything like the same extent to big farmers. 
     There are real equities there.  Take a man with £3,000 or £4,000 worth of land.  There are family charges deliberately placed on that land.  Certain people&mdash;an aunt, a brother, a man's sister, and so on&mdash;have been led to expect certain benefits from that land, and that farmer who owns anything from 100 acres to 400 acres of land has a lot of property.  It is only right and equitable that his brothers and sisters should have certain charges which should be paid.  In fact, in practice those charges are put on this land, and the people whose charges are put on expect them to be honoured, and the owner of the land contemplates that he is to pay these charges.  In such a case of big farms it would be grossly unfair, and this is an answer   to Deputy Doctor Ryan's question last night, instead of making a limit of £200 the limit should be ten times the Poor Law valuation.  That would bring it up to £2,000.  If you could make a loan of £2,000 to a farmer with a valuation of £200 without discharging the equities, then you get into a totally different case.  It would be most unfair to do it.  In my opinion, you would be much more likely to do wrong or defeat the equitable claimant who has a right to expect something out of the land, and for that reason we have chosen to adopt the principle that this Bill shall apply to lands up to a certain limit.  The limit is £200 rather than a limit which will have any reference to the Poor Law valuation.  We do not propose in the case of a big farmer, where there are real equities existing, charging anything.  In a great many cases there are real equities existing. That figure of 90 per cent. would not apply to that.  I should say in the case of 60 per cent. of these farmers there are real equities existing.  If a man applies for a loan of £2,000 he ought to be able to afford to pay £10 for the purpose of discharging the equities. He is in an entirely different position from the small farmer who wants £200. That is the only answer I can give to Deputy Moore or other Deputies like Deputy Maguire who made that point. This is a balance, an attempt to choose the lesser of two evils.  There is no doubt about it, and I say that from experience, not only here but as a solicitor, that so far as small farmers are concerned it will not do injustice.  It is a serious thing to do injustice even in a small percentage of cases, to take away rights in a small percentage of cases, but as a result of Section 3 we preserve fairly well all the rights we have.  In fact these are the two difficult sections in the Bill.  That is the whole Bill, and when I have said that about these two sections and explained Section 2 I think I have explained the whole Bill.  There are other considerations, of course, which possibly I will get an opportunity of dealing with when concluding.  They are points that were raised in the debate yesterday evening. 
     
      
       I am grateful for the   lucid explanation the Minister has given.  I am very glad to hear that there are only ten per cent. of claimants. 
     
     
      
       I say that is an outside figure.  It is a conservative figure; between 90 and 95 per cent. would be more like it. 
     
     
      
       It rather surprises me, from my own knowledge, because it so happens that in reading this Bill I can think of numbers of small farmers I know.  One's own experience is that there are a good many small farmers in the position that equities are not discharged, and it is reasonable to assume from that that the average in the country is very high. 
     
     
      
       There are practically no farmers who have equities discharged&mdash;none. But my point is that, though equities are not discharged in 95 per cent. of cases as far as small farmers are concerned, there are no equities which ever would be enforced against them.  Does the Deputy follow me? 
     
     
      
       I follow the Minister now, but I would not be so sure of that. 
     
     
      
       That is the view of the Registrar of Titles. 
     
     
      
       With regard to the big farmer, the reason for fixing the maximum at £200 is not to me satisfactory. Often there are good reasons for not discharging the equities; often it is not indifference or anything else. I know some cases where, I think, it is quite proper for the possessor not to discharge the equities.  It would mean sending certain substantial sums of money out of the country to people who are not expecting it, and who really do not deserve it.  I think it would be worth while considering that point in Committee as to whether the £200 maximum should not be raised.  Yet I feel more satisfied than before the Minister made his statement as to the small injustices that will be inflicted by this Bill.  I think we should be very careful to see that the Bill is as perfect in that respect as we can make it. It is very easy to defeat our own interests, and no one should take a light view of it. 
     
     
     
      
       Suppose there is a farm worth £300.  The registered owner is A.; his brother is B.  They are equally entitled to the farm, but A is the registered owner of the place. The Agricultural Credit Corporation grants a loan of £150.  A gets the loan and it is registered against the land; he fails to pay back, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation sells the farm for £300.  They take £150, and there is £150 left.  The other brother has a claim to the whole of that £150, because that is the value of the registered owner's share. 
     
     
      
       Is it not thought necessary to protect the equitable claimants in the case of permanent improvement? It is possible that a farm that would in certain respects be permanently improved may, from the point of view of the claimants, be not so improved.  I could easily see people spending hundreds of pounds on a small farm that would not increase the selling value of the farm to the extent of hundreds of pounds.  I think that would be the common case in many places, particularly if the person in possession were not friendly with the other claimants. If he felt that he could build a very good house for himself, for instance, through a loan from the Agricultural Credit Society, it is quite imaginable that he would be inclined to do so, and, as a matter of fact, in the estimation of other people, the additional value of the house would not have raised the selling value of the estate proportionately. I understand also that this Bill does not cover land that is not vested in the Land Commission. 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       There is still a considerable amount of Land that is not vested in the Land Commission, and it will be serious if it is not brought within the scope of the Bill.  It is remarked here on my right that one-third of the land is not yet vested.  It is a pity, I think, that there was not an attempt made to make this a more complete Bill.  I think the Minister will have to face the problem of bankrupt farmers.  There is a big number of them throughout the country who will   not get a loan from this Corporation or from any bank.  The country cannot afford to see these farmers emigrate or become dependent on Home Help or something of that kind.  Numbers of cases that I have been asked to interest myself in have been cases of that type, people who have no credit in the world. In some cases they are good farmers; they would, if they got a start, possibly be able to make a success of their farms.  Certainly, I cannot see that the country can afford to say to them: &ldquo;You have got to clear out; we have no use for you; we cannot help you to get going on your land again.&rdquo;  It would be worth while, I think, considering whether a court of some kind could not be set up to deal with such cases, and to see whether there could not be some method of liquidating the debts of these people, so that they may get going on their land.  In many cases they have not been able to get seed; they have no stock on the land.  There was one case that I was asked to interest myself in, where on a farm of well over 100 acres the only stock were a couple of brood mares.  That land was waste. 
     
     
      
       That is probably why he was in a bad way. 
     
     
      
       Obviously that land is waste and the buildings on it are of no use.  Something will have to be done in such cases.  I think it is a pity that an effort was not made to bring such things within the scope of this measure. We would like to have heard what the experience of the Agricultural Credit Corporation has been up to the present. We would like to have had a statement as to what the main applications are intended for, and what the prospects of the Corporation being useful are and general information in regard to it.  I am not as enthusiastic about State socialism as Deputy O'Hanlon was last evening, but I think that in any relations between the Government and the Corporation it should be provided that we would get a clear statement as to the experiences of the Corporation and as to what it hopes to do for the farmers of the country. 
     
     
      
       took the Chair. 
     
     
     
      
       I welcome this Bill, because I realise that in every case in which an application for a loan was made in my constituency this crux arose and advances were refused generally. Consequently when this impediment is removed we will have an opportunity of judging whether the Agricultural Credit Corporation carries out all the work that it is supposed to do. I have no qualms about injustice arising out of the equities.  I know that in the case of a small farmer whose land is unstocked, and who is probably in debt, no claimant is going to sue in the courts, and whatever chance such a person may have of getting anything, it is when the farm is stocked and the farmer gets on his legs again.  I think that there is too much of the old conservative spirit of banking about the Agricultural Credit Corporation, so far as I have observed it up to this.  I do not think that it is right that an amount representing only 50 per cent. of the value of the farm should be advanced in the form of a loan. All the circumstances should be taken into account, and where the claims against the land are not very much, and where a farmer has shown improvement in the valuation of the land during his period of occupation, the loan should be measured according to that value.  Another matter in connection with these loans is that, apart from the interest being too high, which it is, the method of repayment is too hard under present circumstances.  So far as I understand, a loan is advanced for, say, five years and the person who gets it has to start repaying the capital in half-yearly sums.  Five years, in the first place, is too short.  At least half of the period should be allowed to elapse before the repayments start. 
     
     My idea would be something along the lines of the system adopted in the Agricultural Credit Act passed by the British Parliament, but it should, of course, be more definite, say a period of sixty years.  I will, I suppose, be met with the argument that a farmer should be able to repay a loan advanced for stock in a much shorter period. That would not apply in all cases.  In cases where a man is under a big amount of debt and where the land is generally poor, a period of five or ten   years would be altogether too short. Deputy Moore, in the course of his statement, referred to farmers who are bankrupt or on the edge of bankruptcy and whose farms are depleted of stock. Take the case of a man who in the height of the war years, at the peak of inflation, bought a farm for say £2,000 and it has now dropped in value to about £800.  That is a big estimate. That man finds that he cannot sell his farm or get the valuation reduced and the bank which advanced the money insists on the whole amount being repaid. Ultimately, after unnecessary suffering and prolonged processes in law, they have to accept the present valuation.  I have been told that such matters are questions between the bank and the individual.  I think that the Agricultural Credit Corporation would be doing a great service if they intervened in such matters, arbitrated, fixed a price, and advanced the amount of money required to repay the bank. That process will drag on and it will retard agricultural progress.  Why not settle the matter in a systematic way and extend the repayment over a period of years?  Otherwise it will be no good, either to the farmer or the bank.  The necessary credit could be created to do that. 
     As regards the amount of the advances which the Corporation are to make now that a certain barrier has been taken out of the way, I hope in view of the fact that they will only be able to advance one and a quarter million in the first year according to the amount of capital they call up, that their operations will be speeded up, and that the advances will not be limited to the present amount.  If they find after seven or eight months that they require further money, the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Finance can come to this House and ask for greater powers for the Corporation.  The Banking Commission in their second interim report quoted the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in Great Britain as saying: &ldquo;Before the war it was commonly considered that a farmer should possess working capital for ordinary purposes amounting to about £10 per acre.  At the present time the corresponding   amount is about £15.&rdquo;  The Banking Commission commenting on that statement said: &ldquo;We do not think that it can be contended that the average working capital at the disposal of farmers in Saorstat Eireann is anything like the figure of £15 here mentioned, though the higher percentage of tillage in Great Britain naturally calls for a greater amount of such capital.&rdquo;  Let us consider these figures and let us consider the number of derelict farms, half stocked farms, and the number of farmers in debt in every parish.  Let us assume that there is only a deficit of £2 per acre on working capital, which is a very conservative estimate.  That means that on twelve and a quarter millions of acres of tillage and agricultural land you would need twelve and a half millions, and you are providing only seven millions for a period of six years. 
     
      
       Would not £2 an acre make the land dear along with the existing rents and taxes? 
     
     
      
       This is to give fresh capital.  Let it make the land dear.  That is all the better, because you are preserving the interest of the tenant.  You are preserving the existing tenants in their holdings.  The alternative is that they would have to get out and migrate.  Even if an inflationary process arose out of this it is much better than the present state of things.  I do not know what particular information the Agricultural Credit Corporation gets with reference to the suitability of applicants for advances. 
     
     
      
       On a point of order, would the Deputy say what section of the Bill this refers to?  He has been speaking for the last twenty minutes, and I have been vainly trying to understand what section of the Bill he is dealing with. 
     
     
      
       For Deputy Wolfe's information I might say that the discussion started here yesterday, and it followed the trend on which I am going.  We are trying to state things that we know to exist. 
     
     
      
       Which section of the Bill are you dealing with? 
     
     
     
      
       I think that on Second Reading it is permissible for a Deputy to suggest things that might be in the Bill.  I therefore suggest that Deputy Wolfe is out of order. 
     
     
      
       I understood that we were discussing a Bill.  If the Deputy is discussing the Bill I want to know what section he is referring to.  I suggest he is not discussing the Bill. 
     
     
      
       This is the Second Reading of the Bill, and on Second Reading it is permissible for the Deputy to criticise the Bill either for what it contains or for what he thinks it should contain. 
     
     
      
       For Deputy Wolfe's information, when we approached this Bill in a spirit of cooperation, I suggest when we know that certain things are not operative under the original Bill and suggest ways in which they could be operative, we are quite in order and that such a suggestion should be welcome.  I was going to ask when certain applicants make application to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, how does the Corporation find out the suitability of these applicants for advances? 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is going near the verge of being out of order now. 
     
     
      
       I will try to keep in a bit.  It is very peculiar that when two neighbours apply for a loan one should get it and the other should not, and the latter is apparently in better circumstances.  I can give an example here without quoting names.  There was an applicant who had ninety-one statute acres of £59 valuation.  On that land there were nine stores value £12 each, two cows valued £20 each, two horses valued together £36&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       The Deputy is now discussing the administration of the original Act, and that is certainly not in order. 
     
     
      
       Of course the equities may come in there.  Now that the question of equities has been dealt with in an equitable fashion, such a case like this should meet with greater consideration where there are no bank   debts and no annuities or rates due. I cannot give further examples, but there is one thing I wish to point out, and that is, that if the Corporation find after a period of six or seven months that they are not dealing speedily enough with applicants, and find their funds are running short, I hope they will come to this House with a fresh Bill asking for greater powers.  I hope the Government, which was so liberal in giving a fiduciary note issue of six millions to the banks at one-and-a-half per cent., will say: "We will give a similar amount to the Agricultural Credit Corporation at one per cent. for the benefit of the farming community.'' There is nothing revolutionary in that.  What has been done in such places as Esthonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Australia, we can do as well. 
     
     
      
       This Bill, I am glad to say, will remove some of the obstructions that were in the way of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I expect another Bill will be necessary to complete it, in order that it may bring at least a certain amount of benefit to the farming community. The idea of credit corporations, credit for farmers, is really a good one, but I fear that this particular system which we have adopted has been largely influenced by the banking profession of this country.  As a commercial concern, the banking system, I am sure, is all right and quite satisfactory, but for the agricultural industry the present banking system is not satisfactory.  It is not a good idea, I believe, that the Credit Corporation should allow itself to be influenced to such a degree by these institutions.  The conditions, to my mind, are really more severe than obtain in banking.  If there is one thing that the farming community do not understand, it is that system of red tape, and probably what appears to them, anyway, as the unnecessary information that is asked for. 
     
     I am sure it is the experience of the Credit Corporation up to the present that many of these forms have been improperly filled in by persons applying for loans. Perhaps they, at times, attributed that to some idea on the part of the farmers that they would get a   little extra or would influence the Corporation. That was not generally the case.  Farmers are not great bookkeepers. They are not like commercial firms, with directors and a staff of clerks.  These directors or owners are themselves accustomed to keeping books and to filling up official forms.  Farmers have great difficulty in filling up these forms, and have made mistakes which were not dishonest.  If such cases were inquired into it could be proved that the mistakes were not intentional, that items that should not have been put down were put down through ignorance. 
     It is no doubt a good thing on the part of the Credit Corporation to protect themselves against bad debts and losses.  If I understand the matter correctly, I believe the aim of the directors is to make a hundred per cent. success of the Corporation.  One hundred per cent. successes are not easily obtained. Business firms and others are content with much less.  They all start out with the intention of taking an average amount of risk.  I believe that the Credit Corporation should start out with the intention of taking a risk and not be too much afraid of making mistakes. Mistakes are made and will be made, and those who are afraid to make mistakes very seldom succeed.  I believe the restrictions are too severe; that there are too many precautions taken to ensure the success of the Corporation. I believe that they want to be more generous, that the farming industry deserves from the State much more generous treatment. 
     
      
       The speech of the Deputy is rather one on the Act than on this Bill. 
     
     
      
       This Bill is to remove certain restrictions or impediments that remain in the path of the success of the Corporation and of the farming community, whom the Act was intended to make successful.  I want, as far as possible, to put the idea that lies behind the farmer's mind in order that it may be thoroughly understood what is really irritating to him or what prevents the   success of the Bill.  No doubt it might be better, and more successful, if instead of giving the subsidy direct to the farmer, it could be given to the man who consumes.  It is quite possible that the farming industry would be stimulated, that the market would be there for the farmer to sell his products. That is a rather impossible method under present conditions, and the method that has been adopted is the Credit Corporation.  But as long as these impossible conditions remain, and the farmer is tied down by red tape, it will not be very easy to give him credit. 
       I advocate more generous treatment on the part of the Corporation; that a simpler system should be adopted; that the giving of credit should be quickened and the disappointments that exist removed.  I hold that the present Bill will largely remove the impediments and, therefore, the disappointments; but up to the present there have been very serious disappointments to the farming community through the working of this Corporation. I have read in the newspapers and elsewhere promises that everything was going to be changed; that the Credit Corporation by giving credit to the farmers was going to be a sort of magic wand, and that the whole agricultural industry was going to revive.  But when it came to be worked, and all these impossible conditions were put up, the farmers were sadly disappointed.  I doubt very much even if this Bill will go far enough, for the reason that it is not generous enough. If this country is to be successful, the farming community must get generous and fair treatment.  Conditions, rules and regulations are things that farmers do not understand.  They fail to see why the form sent out has to be filled up so completely.  I believe the form could be simplified; that the number of items in it could be reduced, and that it could be made much more understandable to men not accustomed to filling such forms. 
     
     
      
       Supposing the Deputy were lending his own money, how many questions would he ask? 
     
     
     
      
       Is either the Deputy or the Minister in order? 
     
     
      
       What the Minister asks is perfectly reasonable, but, under these conditions, I hold that it is not the money of any private individual or any banking system that is to be lent, but the money of the nation which is to be lent to a part of the nation, which has been robbed or starved up to the present.  The greater part of the nation&mdash;80 per cent. of the nation&mdash;have been deprived of credit, deprived of capital to work their holdings, with the result that 50 or 60 per cent. of the country is nonproductive. This is an effort to cure that disease, but the amount is not sufficient, because the agricultural community have been completely dislocated, their capital has been taken away from them.  They never had much capital and it is an industry that needs capital.  If more capital could be given to the agricultural community, you would at once have more production from the land.  The grazing system and the rearing of livestock have been adopted largely because there was not sufficient capital to work the agricultural end.  If more capital could be advanced, if it is found that the Credit Corporation is 80 or 90 per cent. successful, and could advance some more, it would be all to the good and the success of the Corporation would be all the greater. If the Corporation are to be successful they will have to take more risks than they have taken, even with this Bill added on.  They must be much more generous than they have been.  The idea is a good one, but it needs a great deal of development before it can have any effect on the farming community. 
     
     
      
       I have listened with very great pleasure to the speech of Deputy O'Reilly, who always speaks so thoughtfully, and imparts interest to any matter on which he speaks.  His great difficulty in connection with this Bill, so far as I can understand it, is that he is living in mortal terror that the Credit Corporation may earn 100 per cent.  I should like to reassure him on that point. He need not be in any fear.  There   will be no such dividend as 100 per cent. paid by the Corporation. 
     
     
      
       On a point of explanation: I did not mention that the dividends were to be 100 per cent., but that the Corporation was to be 100 per cent. successful. 
     
     
      
       I understood that when the Deputy was speaking of 100 per cent. he was referring to income and not capital.  However, I take it now that when he suggested 100 per cent. he was referring to capital, and that when he was suggesting a reduction below five per cent. he was referring to the limit to which capital ought to go. I was hoping that I would hear something from some of the Deputies about the Bill that we are discussing; that some Deputy or other would tell us something about equities.  I knew they could give us that information but, for some strange reason, from none of the Deputies who have spoken except the Minister have we heard a word about equities. 
       I dislike saying a word of praise about any Minister.  What has happened in connection with this Bill is that when a Bill was passed, owing to the peculiar system of the land registry, the Agricultural Credit Corporation were threatened with what is known as foot and mouth disease.  Then they had only to appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and he brought this Bill forward as a tonic and cure for this foot and mouth disease.  And in agreeing to say a word in his praise I would like to hear some suggestion from somebody as to how that tonic could be improved because, in my submission to the House, the Minister has shown not merely speed but unusual ability and ingenuity in dealing with that very difficult problem. Could any one of us, no matter from which branch of the Opposition we come, give him one suggestion as to how he could, in the slightest degree, improve on the suggestions he has brought forward in this Bill? 
     
     I personally, perhaps, may know something, or I may not, about land registration, but looking at the Bill, and I have looked at it with one object only, I can make no suggestions to this House that would in any way improve   the objects of the Bill.  I have read it and re-read it.  I know it is difficult and may not be without faults, but as to the cure for these faults, nothing but experience will bring us that.  I do think this is a measure which the country is calling for, and that it ought to be passed, and speedily passed.  It is up to the House to see that the Bill which is brought forward, and which has the unanimous approval of the country, is passed into law in the shortest possible period. 
     
      
       I believe this is a Bill about which there should be no difference of opinion, and that all parties ought to agree to.  It is a most useful Bill, and we believe it should get a very speedy passage through the House.  The main feature of the Bill, as explained by the Minister, is that if any person who has registered land wishes to borrow money it will be necessary where equities have not been discharged, to discharge them.  This Bill provides facilities for a charge on these lands.  As the law stands, it is necessary for a borrower to have the equities discharged on registered land.  Under this Bill, it is provided that you can charge the lands.  The discharge of the equities would cost money.  It would cost £5 to discharge the equities on a small farm and probably more.  This, coupled with the cost of the mortgage, and six per cent. interest on a loan of £50 or £60, leaves it of very little use.  It means that the money is very costly.  Let us see what it does mean.  If a man wants to borrow £50 or £60 it will probably cost £4 to discharge the equities, from £3 to £4 10s. for the mortgage, and six per cent. interest added to that.  That means that a man would start with an expenditure of £8 or £9.  If he gets ten years to repay that money, instead of paying six per cent. interest on the money, it means that he would be paying about ten per cent. on £50 for ten years.  That would be ten per cent. per annum.  That is altogether too expensive. I would suggest also as to the expenses of the mortgage that that should be borne by the Corporation, or if the Corporation would not agree to that, at least that they would only charge the outlay, because, as I have said, it may cost from £3 10s. to £4 10s.   for the mortgage, whereas the outlay would be only 15s. or £1.  I suggest that the Minister in his reply should make some statement on these matters. 
       As regards a person who wants to borrow a few hundred pounds, he can, under this Bill, borrow this money and the charge in favour of the Credit Corporation will take precedence over equities.  That, so far as the borrowers are concerned, is all right.  How it will work out in equities the Minister has explained.  It seems fair and equitable. As to the discharge of equities, there are in my constituency a number of people who require loans.  We all know the plight of the farmers.  They are in a bad way.  In 1924, which was an exceptionally wet year, in certain districts in my constituency hundreds of sheep and cattle were lost.  A great many of these farmers at present cannot borrow money.  They had hopes that under Section 25 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1927 they could borrow on a chattel mortgage.  Now, it seems that is not operating.  Why I do not know, but I can give you one particular case where a farmer who had nineteen cattle and eighteen of them died leaving him one.  As it happened, this man had a mortgage on his land; he was unable to pay the interest on his mortgage and he was unable to pay the annuities.  The result was that he got into a state of despair. There was a receiver appointed; the receiver was unable to let the land. The man left the district.  This man had no control over the circumstances. He pinned his faith to getting a loan under the Agricultural Credit Act of 1927.  Now it appears he cannot get a loan and I would like that the Minister, when replying, would make a statement on this.  The Bill is an excellent Bill. It will be welcomed by every section of the community, and, as I said, it should be passed speedily through this House. 
     
     
      
       resume the Chair. 
     
     
      
       Everyone says that he is in favour of the principle of the Bill.  It is the principle of the Bill which should be debated on the Second Reading and in that state of   affairs I suggest it would be well to have a fairly long interval between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage.  I wonder would there be any possibility of getting the Second Reading now in order to effect that purpose? 
     
     
      
       Can it be debated on the Committee Stage? 
     
     
      
       The sections can be debated in Committee. 
     
     
      
       If the Second Reading is passed to-night, that will give a fairly long time between now and the Committee Stage. 
     
     
      
       Might I ask one question? 
     
     
      
       Is there agreement that the Second Reading should be taken to-night so that the Committee should be taken next week? 
     
     
      
       Next Thursday. 
     
     
      
       What is the reason of the haste in taking the Second Reading to-night?  I ask that, because in Committee we would not be allowed to give the same criticisms of the Act as we can on the Second Reading. 
     
     
      
       The point made by the Minister is quite sound to this extent: that in the case of all Bills, and more particularly in the case of Bills the principle of which is actually not going to be divided against in the House, the most important thing for the ordinary member is to have a fairly long interval between the Second Reading Stage and Committee. There is no doubt at all about that.  That is common experience.  The most important thing for the ordinary Deputy is to have a long period between the Second Reading and Committee. The same liberty does not apply to the Committee Stage as to the Second Reading Stage.  As An Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been pointing out, the Second Reading Stage of this Bill does not give an opportunity of criticising the Agricultural Credit Act or the Agricultural Credit Corporation. 
     
     
     
      
       It is not a question of objection to the Bill, but objection to the administration of the Act; that is what the Deputies want to speak about. We have had instances to which we would like to refer. 
     
     
      
       Deputies cannot do that on this Bill. 
     
     
      
       The operations of the Agricultural Credit Corporation cannot be criticised here at all. 
     
     
      
       I think we have precedents for discussing and criticising other Acts in Amending Bills going through this House. 
     
     
      
       That was criticism of the Minister, and one of the things always in order is criticism of Ministers.  Is there agreement, first and foremost on this matter, that the Second Reading is to be put through to-night? 
     
     
      
       You might know that at 10.30. 
     
     
      
       It will be too late then for the Minister. 
     
     
      
       I am not anxious to reply. 
     
     
      
       I think it is very unfair to rush this Bill and not allow people who want to speak on it to say what they have to say. 
     
     
      
       Deputies can say a great deal on the Second Reading of this Bill, but they cannot discuss the Agricultural Credit Corporation on this Bill. 
     
     
      
       In view of the fact that there is general agreement that the Second Reading should be taken as expeditiously as possible, perhaps you would extend a little latitude on the Committee Stage? 
     
     
      
       Yes, but I am not prepared to agree that the Agricultural Credit Corporation can be discussed in any stage of this Bill.  That is certainly not the way to do it. 
     
     
      
       May one discuss certain sections which would tend to improve the Act of 1927? 
     
     
     
      
       Yes, and that opportunity will be lost after the Second Reading. 
     
     
      
       That is very important. 
     
     
      
       I welcome this new Bill, and I hope it will be some improvement, at least, upon the old Bill.  I agree with some previous speakers here that this Agricultural Credit Corporation should be to some extent under the control of this House.  After all, the State has advanced a considerable amount of the money, and the State should have some control in the disposal of that money.  The Corporation, at the present time, costs a considerable sum of money.  That sum, if given to the credit of the borrowers, would easily pay 1 per cent. on £600,000.  The great complaint about this loan is that it is too dear.  Farmers who are trying to get this loan from the Corporation could get it quite easily from a bank at the same rate of interest which the Corporation pays. If the State is to give them something, if it is to assist them, let the State assist them in earnest.  Let them not do it in the way they are doing&mdash;giving them only what they can get elsewhere. We have a lot of discontented men at present, a lot of farmers who were expecting a loan on easy terms, and now, after waiting to stock their farms, after waiting for the Corporation, now find that they are to be disappointed, and are in a worse position than at first. 
       Another drawback, too, in connection with the Act is that farmers cannot borrow small sums up to fifty pounds, except through credit societies.  We all know the small credit societies have been a failure.  At least, they have been a failure in the County Cavan, and probably in other counties too. The result is that farmers who want a loan of fifty pounds have no means of getting it.  When this Act was going through, I understood that some of this money could be devoted to the purpose of paying annuities. 
     
     It seems very hard lines on a man who owes a half-year's annuity that he is not allowed to pay it out of this money.  There seems to be no reason   for that, because if he could pay it he would get rid of some of his debts.  The Government must acknowledge that, owing to the secret mortgage they have allowed in the Act, they have done a considerable amount of harm.  They have stopped the shopkeeper giving credit for seeds and machinery. 
     
      
       Where? 
     
     
      
       Everywhere.  They have stopped the banks giving a certain amount of credit, because they do not know whether or not there has been a secret mortgage on the farm.  There is no means of finding it out.  Solicitors, on the other hand, will not advise their clients to advance money to farmers on account of the secret mortgage.  It has done a considerable amount of harm, and now the Government are not going to assist the farmers in the last moment. I think they should put on more speed and try to see what can be done.  I made the suggestion here a couple of years ago that if they would give security to the bank and allow the bank to advance moneys, they would be in a better position, and it would save a lot of the expense incurred by the Corporation. 
     
     
      
       I beg to move the adjournment of the debate until tomorrow. 
       Debate adjourned accordingly. 
     
   
   
     THE ADJOURNMENT&mdash;RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT. 
     
      
       To-day I addressed a question to the Minister for Finance asking him, in view of the very large amount of unemployment at the present time prevailing and the poverty and suffering occasioned thereby, was it the intention of the Government to introduce a Supplementary Estimate prior to the adjournment of the Dail in order to finance relief schemes.  so that work would be provided for the unemployed.  My reason in tabling that question was owing to the fact that at the present time there are tens of thousands of unemployed men and women in the Saorstat, and the majority of those unemployed men and women are legitimately looking for work, but are, unfortunately, unable to   find it.  Many of those who are unemployed in Dublin and elsewhere are married men with wives and families. Some of them have been in insurable occupations, but their unemployment insurance benefits have become exhausted. Some of them, such as agricultural labourers, in other parts of the country, not being in insurable occupations, are not entitled to draw any benefits. 
       The Dail will be adjourning inside the next week or fortnight for a period of approximately three months.  Many of the Deputies on the Government benches will be going away to enjoy themselves at seaside resorts and elsewhere. No doubt some of the Ministers will be going to France or Sweden or other continental resorts in order that they also may enjoy themselves.  I do appeal to Government Deputies and to the Ministers who are going away to enjoy themselves to picture the scenes which will take place in Dublin and other parts of the country in the homes of the unemployed.  Many of these unemployed are married men with wives and families.  They have to feed their families, clothe them, educate them, and pay house rents.  Picture the plight of an unemployed man, with a wife and family, whose benefits are exhausted or who was never entitled to draw unemployment benefits. His wife and children are calling out for food and he has no food to give them. 
     
     The Minister, in the course of his reply to-day, was very brief and abrupt.  He said it was not the intention of the Government to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for the relief of unemployment.  Is it any wonder that I charge the Minister and the Government Party with callous indifference to the plight of the unemployed in Dublin, Donegal and elsewhere throughout the Saorstat?  The unfortunate fact is that Ministers, as well as members of the Government Party, seem to have got the idea that unemployment is a necessary evil which must and always will exist.  I am one of those people who hold otherwise, and I believe if the Government had the moral courage or the pluck to face up in a proper manner to this question   of unemployment, the situation could be relieved, if not altogether wiped out. 
     Deputies here who were members of the First Dail will recollect that in the year 1919 there was passed or adopted in that Dail what was known as the Democratic Programme.  For the benefit of Deputies who were not in the First Dail I will point out that one of the clauses in the Democratic Programme was: &ldquo;That while the duty of the citizens is to give allegiance and service to the commonwealth, it is the right of the citizen to demand of the nation an opportunity to work for adequate reward.&rdquo;  I want to know are the Ministers prepared to face up to the fine words in that particular clause in the Democratic Programme, or, on the other hand, have they run away from that Democratic Programme? Apparently, according to the indifferent reply which I received from the Minister for Finance to-day, he no longer is a believer in that Democratic Programme. 
     I charge the Government, here and now, not alone with indifference towards the unemployed in Dublin, Donegal and elsewhere, but also with putting a premium on dishonesty.  The reason I do that is this.  If you take a dishonest man at present who commits an offence, he is brought before a court and convicted.  He is put into prison and the cost of keeping a man in prison, for food alone, is 13s. 4d. a week.  That means that the Government are prepared to pay, for the upkeep of a dishonest man, a sum of 13s. 4d., whereas an honest unemployed worker is not allowed to get benefits if he has not been in an insurable occupation, and, if he has been in such occupation, he is cut off after six months. 
     I put it to the Minister and Deputies on the Government Benches that surely there is some sort of a kink in the social system that allows that sort of thing to go on.  Surely the Ministers could give the time of the House and the brains of the Deputies of all parties in an effort to solve this problem instead of leaving hungry men, women and children with the reply: &ldquo;We are not prepared to do anything for the unemployed.&rdquo;  That is their reply   now, but inside a fortnight we are prepared to adjourn the House and to go to seaside resorts and continental countries.  The Ministers are prepared to do that, but as far as the unemployed in Dublin and other parts of the country are concerned, we are not prepared to do anything for them. 
     Inside the next week I suppose we will be asked to pass a Vote on Account for over £7,000,000.  I would like to go over a few items in that Vote on Account because I believe it has a direct bearing on this question of relief schemes.  Vote 71 is for Relief Schemes; in other words, money to provide work for the unemployed who are unable to find work.  We find in capital letters after it &ldquo;Nil.&rdquo;  They are not prepared to provide any money for that.  Let us go back to the first item and we find Governor-General's Establishment, £2,000.  That is £2,000 for the upkeep of the Governor-General's Establishment while this Dail is adjourned.  Apparently Deputies are prepared to say that that establishment shall be kept up in comfort and in luxury while the poor unemployed men in Gloucester Street or the Coombe or in Donegal are to be allowed to starve.  I put it to Deputies here, is that common justice or common decency?  Is that what you would expect from any Irish Government?  Let us come to another item on the Vote&mdash; Science and Art, £13,000.  Science and art might be quite all right in their own way, but I put it to the Government, can this country afford to spend £13,000 on science and art while so many unemployed hungry men, women and children are in this country?  I put it to them that they have not faced this problem seriously. 
     Deputies will remember that some time ago an Unemployment Committee was set up to inquire into relief measures in connection with the unemployment problem.  That Committee for the relief of unemployment made a report, but so far as the men and women who are unemployed throughout the country are concerned, they have benefited nothing as a result of the finding of that Committee.  I charge the Government here and now with being responsible for that.  The Government set up   this Unemployment Committee with one idea, and that idea was to sidetrack the whole question, because they did not provide money to carry out the findings of that Unemployment Committee. They did not introduce a Supplementary Estimate to give effect to the work of that Committee.  To my mind, it was like asking a bricklayer to build a house without giving him the necessary materials to do it. 
     I understand that Deputy A. Byrne and some other Deputies desire to speak on this question, and I would appeal to the Government now to reconsider their decision before entering upon an adjournment of three months. There are many unemployed, as Ministers know, not only in Dublin, Donegal, Cork and elsewhere, but all over the country.  These unemployed people are looking to this Dail hoping against hope, and they expect the Dail to do something to relieve the unemployment situation before the adjournment. These hungry men, women and children are holding out their hands to this Dail imploring them to do something for them, and I hope the Dail will not adjourn until a supplementary vote shall have been introduced.  No doubt, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, in replying, will tell us what they have done to relieve the unemployment situation.  They have done a little &mdash;just a little.  That little has not been sufficient, no matter what the Ministers may tell us in their replies.  There is no gainsaying the fact that there are, at the moment, men, women and children hungry in the country as a result of unemployment. No doubt the Ministers in replying will indulge in a lot of word-juggling and logic-chopping, but fine phrases and juggling of words will not feed the hungry men, women and children.  Before this House adjourns, I would appeal to Deputies to endeavour to bring pressure to bear on the Government to induce them to face up to this unemployment situation and to provide funds which will go towards the relief of the unemployed. 
     
      
       No words of mine could possibly describe the appalling conditions in the tenements of Dublin to-day.  I would ask Deputies to take a   stroll through Gloucester Street, Gardiner Street, Grenville Street, Henrietta Street and such streets, which are within five minutes walk from the Nelson Pillar. They will find people in the tenements there hungry.  I do not wish to exaggerate the conditions that obtain in the tenements of Dublin to-day, but I take this opportunity of asking the Minister if he will take the word of inspectors of the St. Vincent de Paul Society or of the Roomkeepers' Society.  Both those societies are heavily in debt as a result of the administration of relief.  They are working on overdrafts, secured by a few residents of the city.  I ask why that should be, when we have an authority here that should administer relief to deserving cases.  For some unknown reason they refuse to put their powers into operation.  Section 13 of the Local Government Act, 1898, reads as follows:&mdash; 
       Where the guardians of any union satisfy the council that exceptional distress exists in some district electoral division, situate both in the union and in the county, and the council apply to the Local Government Board, the Board may, if it thinks fit, by order, authorise the guardians, subject to the prescribed conditions, to administer relief out of the workhouse, for any time not exceeding two months from the date of the order, to poor persons of any description resident in the said electoral division, and they may revoke any such order either wholly or partially or with reference to any particular class of persons. 
     
     There they have power to administer relief to &ldquo;poor persons of any description.&rdquo;  Dublin city&mdash;I mention this specially for the information of the country members, because we in Dublin are going to ask for their support in this matter&mdash;is the only part of the Free State where that section is not put into operation.  You have a system of home assistance in the country. I will ask Deputies who know that a small number of unemployed in their own districts are getting home assistance from the authorities to support this appeal and to assist in seeing that the Dublin poor and the Dublin unemployed are put on the same basis   as those in their own areas.  What are the conditions so far as the Dublin unemployed man is concerned?  A man with five or six children is healthy and strong and fit to work, but that makes no difference.  He may be fit to work, but he cannot get work, and his children and wife get nothing.  They may go a-begging.  That is what is going on in Dublin to-day.  The relief institutions are practically broken.  You can see statements in the papers that the charitable institutions are visited by people who, when they leave the building, do not know where the next meal is to come from.  A lady with whom I was associated in public affairs some time ago&mdash;Miss Harrison&mdash; has done her utmost to draw the attention of the public to the conditions that exist in Dublin city.  It would be interesting if the Minister for Local Government would issue a report showing the death-rate in Dublin, especially in respect of infants of three months old and new-born babes.  The reason I ask for that is that I have a letter here from a man who made an appeal to me to secure assistance for himself, his wife and six children, as they might be on the streets the following morning. I was in the same position as other Deputies, and was unable to help that man.  Next day, that unfortunate man called upon me to ask me to subscribe towards purchasing a coffin for a dead-born babe.  That occurred last week in one of our principal hospitals. He was an unemployed man who served the State and who had six children.  I have his letter here for the information of any Deputy who wishes to see it.  I should like somebody outside Dublin to investigate that case.  I know there are sympathetic Deputies in this House who are willing to be convinced that something should be done for the unemployed of Dublin.  I say that if something cannot be done to provide work for them, it is up to the State to provide for their wives and children. 
     We have, then, the case of the school children.  There are children going to school in Dublin barefooted and hungry.  I know a school in Dublin in which the teachers, who have not very good salaries, subscribe out of their own pockets and do their utmost to provide sandwiches or necessaries for   the children when they arrive at the school.  That should not be.  Regarding the answer the Minister gave me on this question of Section 13&mdash;&mdash; 
     
      
       I understand there are two Ministers concerned with this question, and some time should be given them to reply. 
     
     
      
       And somebody on these benches would like to say a word or two also. 
     
     
      
       I will not go through half what I intended to say. I have a list of 73 names of persons with families whom I sent to the authorities within the past week.  I have thirty or forty people calling on me per day.  I know they call on other Deputies who find themselves in the same position as myself.  I can do nothing for them. 
     
     
      
       You voted for a Seanad that would cost £50,000 a year. 
     
     
      
       That is not worth replying to.  Here is a case in which an unfortunate woman with six children writes that they are hungry and can nothing be done for them.  I sent the letter to the authorities, and I said &ldquo;I will be grateful for your kind consideration of the case of Mrs. A.&rdquo; The Secretary of the Union wrote: &ldquo;Will the Relieving Officer please report upon this.&rdquo;  I got back my own letter in answer to the appeal of the woman with the six hungry children, and it was marked &ldquo;This is a case of unemployment.&mdash;Yours, T.M., Relieving Officer.&rdquo;  I got back my own letter without any statement that they are going to do anything to help that person.  I will avail of another opportunity to go into this matter in detail. I hope that if relief schemes are not provided, the Minister will see that this Section 13 is put into operation in Dublin and thus save Crooksling Sanatorium and the hospitals from being over-run with hungry people. 
     
     
      
       I should like to ask the Minister what has become of the great housing scheme that got Deputy Rice returned at the by-election. I do not even see Deputy Rice here. 
     
     
     
      
       In my opinion, the hunger that prevails at present is not merely an awful tragedy for the hungry people but it is actually affecting the working people.  In Arklow, last Saturday, I saw absolute panic amongst people who are themselves comfortable.  At least eight persons to whom I spoke, many of whom are supporters of the Government, put the question to me: &ldquo;Can you, up there, do nothing?  Do you not see hunger stalking through the town?&rdquo; I did see hunger stalking through the town. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health knows that about a month ago the three Deputies from Wicklow signed a request that he should take advantage of a visit to the county which, it was known, he was making to inspect certain work, with a view to relieving the terrible unemployment that prevails in that area.  He was asked to receive the three Deputies who had some suggestions to make and who wanted, at least, to bring before him the tragedy of unemployment in that area.  I am sorry to say that I, at all events, received no reply to that communication.  If the Minister doubts that that state of affairs prevails, he can very easily ascertain from some of the Government supporters in that area.  If he communicated with a priest in Wicklow town, I think he would hear a story of poverty and degradation that would really shock him into doing something. 
     
     
      
       It is impossible to deal with the problem of unemployment by means of voting relief moneys.  We have in most years provided some money for expenditure on relief schemes during the winter.  In particular areas the suffering was no doubt palliated to some extent by those relief schemes, but only a fraction of the people who were unemployed were touched or could be touched by them.  I can see no possibility of substantially dealing with the problem of unemployment by the expenditure of relief moneys.  If we were to embark on a policy of expenditure on relief on a large scale, we could not treat that expenditure as casual and non-recurrent, as we have   heretofore done.  It would have to be treated as normal and recurrent, and additional taxation would have to be imposed.  The imposition of taxation for the finding of the relief moneys would aggravate unemployment.  The money expended on relief is always to some extent wasteful.  In some cases it is very wasteful.  In other cases a moderate economic return is got, but on the whole good results are not obtained from it. 
     
     
      
       Is it not a good result if it feeds hungry men, women and children? 
     
     
      
       What a tragic commentary on your highly organised capitalist system. 
     
     
      
       Nothing better than a moderate palliative can be got by means of relief moneys.  Something better can be done where definite schemes of construction are formulated. Something fairly substantial, in all the circumstances, has been done in that way through the expenditure on housing, for instance, the expenditure on roads and from the amounts annually expended by the Land Commission on improvement works and drainage.  The view of the Government has been that, while they have found it necessary from time to time to vote certain sums for relief, more attention should be given to the formulation of constructive schemes.  That is a matter that, perhaps, Deputies could co-operate in better than they have done heretofore. We hear criticism and we hear appeals, and we hear instances quoted of heartbreaking hardship, but it would be better if we had some more attention given by all the Deputies in the House to the thinking out of constructive schemes. 
     
     
      
       Will the Government put up the money? 
     
     
      
       I do not think that this Dail, through various circumstances, has ever been able to concentrate on economic matters as it might have concentrated on them in different circumstances.  If we were to reach a position where there could be more concentration on those questions   although Deputies might disagree very violently as to the means and methods, still out of the discussion and out of the conflict further progress might be made.  I have no time to refer to the housing scheme, except to say that there did not come out of the conference that was held as much as was expected.  I do not know whether anything will ultimately come, but, in any case, we will have a Housing Bill in the autumn.  It will be a Housing Bill with a longer period of life and which will contemplate a longer programme than any of the Housing Bills that have heretofore been introduced.  The points that were raised by Deputy Byrne were really Local Government points and did not directly relate to the question of relief moneys. 
     
     
      
       The Minister said there was an intention to introduce a Housing Bill in the autumn.  Would it be possible to introduce that Bill before the House rises, so that people might be making preparations to go ahead with housing and some relief of unemployment might be given in the meantime? 
     
     
      
       I do not think we could.  In order that more houses may be built, we have to reconsider the scale of subsidies.  In order that the money may be stretched as far as possible, we have to consider carefully what will be the least subsidy that will cause building operations to be continued. 
     
     
      
       In view of the fact that the Minister is not prepared to introduce the Housing Bill before the summer recess, would he not reconsider his decision as to introducing a supplementary estimate which would be of some help to the unemployed during the recess? 
     
     
      
       No. 
     
     
      
       The Government reply is: &ldquo;Nothing doing.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       And Deputy Rice has come in at two minutes to eleven, and he was returned to this House to help to solve the unemployment problem. 
       The Dail adjourned at 11 p.m. until Friday at 10.30 a.m. 
     
   
   
     WRITTEN ANSWER. - OLD AGE PENSION CLAIM (KILDARE). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state the reasons for the delay in awarding an old age pension to James Cloney.  Fasaugh,   Monasterevan, County Kildare, who sent in his baptismal certificate with his claim on the 7th February, 1928. 
     
     
      
       The claim to an old age pension received from James Cloney, Fasaugh, Monasterevan, was reported upon by the pension officer on 12th April, 1928, and forwarded to the local pension committee.  No decision has yet been received from the committee.
