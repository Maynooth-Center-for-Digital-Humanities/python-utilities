     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - APPLICATION FOR A TARIFF ON FLOUR. 
     
      
       asked the President whether the Executive Council have considered the Report of the Tariff Commission on the application for a tariff on flour; and, if so, whether he will state what their decision is. 
     
     
      
       The Executive Council have considered the Report of the Tariff Commission and have decided to accept their recommendation that the application for a tariff on flour should not be granted. 
       Other issues raised in the report and the accompanying documents are under consideration. 
     
     
      
       May I ask whether the President is prepared to give us this evening the time that he promised to discuss that report? 
     
     
      
       I am prepared to move the adjournment at 8 o'clock and allow from that till 10.30 o'clock. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - TOWN TENANTS COMMISSION. 
     
      
       asked the President whether he has received the report of the Town Tenants Commission, and, if so, whether he can state when it will be published. 
     
     
      
       The report of the Town Tenants Commission was presented under date of the 27th April. 
       It has not yet been considered by the Executive Council. 
     
     The Secretary of the Commission has been instructed to-day to have the report, together with the appendix   (which is a summary of the evidence), printed and published at the earliest possible date.  This process will take some time, and it will probably be two or three weeks before the report will be on sale to the public.  The publication of the appendix will obviate the necessity for publishing the minutes of evidence  in extenso.  
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - KELLOGG TREATY FOR RENUNCIATION OF WAR. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for External Affairs whether an invitation from the Government of the United States of America to the Free State to become a party to the proposed Kellogg treaty for renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy has been received; whether the terms of the British reply to the United States were communicated to the Executive Council before being sent; and whether he will state what is the attitude of the Executive Council towards the reservations to the general principle of the pact indicated in the following paragraphs of that reply:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;The language of Article 1, as to the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy, renders it desirable that I should remind your Excellency that there are certain regions of the world the welfare and integrity of which constitute a special and vital interest for our peace and safety. 
       &ldquo;His Majesty's Government have been at pains to make it clear in the past that interference with these regions cannot be suffered.  Their protection against attack is to the British Empire a measure of self-defence. 
       &ldquo;It must be clearly understood that His Majesty's Government in Great Britain accept the new treaty upon the distinct understanding that it does not prejudice their freedom of action in this respect.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       The Government have received through the United States Minister at Dublin an invitation from the Government of the United States of America to become one   of the original parties to the proposed multilateral Treaty for the renunciation of war. 
       The terms of the British Note on the subject of this Treaty, which was handed to the United States Ambassador in London on the 19th instant, were communicated to this Government before the Note was issued. 
       The Deputy will observe from the text of his own question, and also from the final paragraph of the British Note with which it deals, that the views embodied in these paragraphs are expressed on behalf of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain only, and do not purport to represent the views of, and cannot therefore in any way commit, the Government of Saorstat Eireann. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister prepared to tell us what his own attitude is with respect to the invitation to become an original party to the Treaty? 
     
     
      
       We are becoming one of the original parties. 
     
     
      
       Will the House have any opportunity of discussing your reply before it is sent? 
     
     
      
       No, it has been sent. 
     
     
      
       Well I wish to give notice that I shall raise this matter on the adjournment at the first opportunity possible.  I do not know how it can be done. 
     
     
      
       We will discuss that matter at the end of questions. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE DAIL LOAN, 1920. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state if Savings Certificates will soon be issued to Hugh Morgan, Cumery, Ballybay (No. 83100. formerly of Bridge Street, Cootehill), in respect of his subscription to the Dail Loan. 1920. 
     
     
      
       The particulars contained in   Mr. Morgan's application for repayment are insufficient to enable my Department to authorise the issue of a Savings Certificate.  A communication on the matter has been addressed to Mr. Morgan. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether authority to issue Savings Certificates to James Black, Moniel, Rockcorry (No. in Dail Register 83316), in respect of his subscription to the Dail Loan, 1920, will soon be given to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. 
     
     
      
       The answer is in the affirmative. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - LIMERICK UNPAID LAND ANNUITIES. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state the total amount of grants withheld from the Limerick County Council in respect of annuities, etc., due to the Irish Land Commission from that county to the 31st December, 1927. 
     
     
      
       The total sum absorbed in the Guarantee Fund and debited against Local Taxation Grants in the case of Limerick County Council on account of arrears of land purchase annuities and deficiency of income up to 31st January, 1928, was £56,497 15s. 5d.  The date 31st January, 1928, is given instead of that mentioned by the Deputy as it is the date at which the arrears were certified in pursuance of Rule 9 (2) of the Land (Finance) Rules, 1925, and Rule 4 (2) of the Purchase Annuities Fund Rules, 1924.

     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - SUBSCRIPTIONS TO DAIL LOAN, 1920 (LONGFORD). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that Richard Tuite, Edgeworthstown, applied in April, 1927, for Savings Certificates in return for his investments in the Dail Loan, 1920, and has since applied for them on three different occasions without success; and whether the Minister can state when Savings Certificates are likely to be issued in this case. 
     
     
      
       Authority to issue a Savings Certificate to Mr. Richard Tuite, of Edgeworthstown, in respect of his subscription of £10 (ten) to the Dail Eireann Loan will be given to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at an early date. 
       The delay in authorising the issue of the certificate is due to the fact that Mr. Tuite in his original application for repayment claimed to have subscribed £20 (twenty).  The claim was repeated in two subsequent communications received from him, and in reply to applications from my Department for the receipt Mr. Tuite stated that the receipt had been lost.  Eventually an amended application for the repayment of £10 was received, and as this amount corresponded with the amount recorded in the primary Register of Subscribers, the amended application was passed for repayment. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - DAIL LOAN&mdash;LOST RECEIPTS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for   Finance whether he will state what steps are being taken to pay subscribers to the Dail Loan, 1920, who have lost their receipts or who, for one reason or another, have not been included on the register prepared at that time. 
     
     
      
       I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by me to a question of his on the 11th November last. 
     
     
      
       I would like to remind the Minister that nothing has been done since, as far as the position in the County Cavan is concerned. 
     
     
      
       I do not agree with that. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister indicate when he will be in a position to make a general statement with regard to the thousands of these cases outstanding?  There are at least one thousand outstanding claims in my own county. 
     
     
      
       I have made two or three statements on the matter and I have not anything to add to these statements at present.  The applications which can be substantiated are being dealt with as rapidly as possible. When it is impossible to get any further with the existing machinery we will consider the question of substituting further machinery. 
     
     
      
       What proof is necessary for those people who say they have subscribed and whose names are not recorded? 
     
     
      
       Sufficient proof to satisfy me. 
     
     
      
       I have known cases where receipts have been sent into the Department and nothing is received but a buff postcard to say the application has been received. 
     
     
      
       Well, they are being dealt with. 
     
     
      
       It is a good job the Estimates are coming on. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister prepared to give the Deputies the same facilities as were formerly granted in order to ascertain whether persons' names are, or are not, on the register? 
     
     
     
      
       No facilities were formerly granted, and if any information was given to Deputies it was given irregularly and I am glad to hear about it. 
     
     
      
       Could not some arrangement be made of a more simple character rather than have this elaborate machinery of putting down questions here?  Could not some machinery be devised of a more simple character? We are not looking at it from the point of view of controversy, but could not some machinery be designed by which a member of the Dail would consult regularly with officials of the Minister's Department and so save us a good deal of these questions and all this expense involved in consequence? 
     
     
      
       An answer which I gave to a question to-day indicates the need for a certain amount of secrecy in regard to the information which the Department possesses.  We had the case of a man who applied for repayment of £20.  He applied for that money two or three times.  Eventually he amended his application to one for £10 and then we were able to repay him.  We must not give any publicity to the information we have because, undoubtedly, if too much leaked out, people would be able to put in claims and perhaps to substantiate, as it would appear, claims which were not really genuine.  We are prepared to give no information that seems to us to involve any danger of people being able to found claims upon it.  Deputies can write and ask for information about particular cases and they will be given the same information in response to a letter as they would be given in response to a question.  Perhaps that would be more satisfactory in every case, but I could not agree to allow Deputies to be informed of the particulars we possess with regard to any particular district or particular application. 
     
     
      
       Deputies have written and they receive information on the subject that is now twelve months old. 
     
     
      
       I should like to ask the Minister why he happened to come to this decision now?  Has he not granted lists of persons who were on   the register to members of his own Party during the past few years? 
     
     
      
       I have consistently refused it. 
     
     
      
       This question was raised before the Committee of Procedure and Privileges and it will be raised again to-morrow.  At that Committee there might be a solution of that question. 
     
     
      
       Could the Minister for Finance allow some representative of his Department who knows the actual difficulties in the matter to come to that Committee and give us information. There may be some cases in which we could be met and there may be some cases in which we could not be met. The House is here day after day having its time taken up with answers to these questions and all the answers seem to be stereotyped.  If there were some attempt made to meet the difficulties it would be appreciated. 
     
     
      
       I will attend myself. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ENNISCORTHY LOAN APPLICATION. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that Mrs. Annie Godfrey, 16 Slaney Street, Enniscorthy, has made repeated applications for repayment of her subscription to Dail Eireann Loan; that her claim to such repayment has been admitted many months ago; and whether he will state the cause of delay in repayment. 
     
     
      
       Authority to issue a Savings Certificate to Mrs. Annie Godfrey in respect of her subscription of £1 (one) to the Dail Eireann Internal Loan will be given to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at an early date.  The delay in issuing the certificate is due to the fact that insufficient particulars were furnished in her applications for repayment.  Only after a second request to her did she state the amount of the subscription and the address on the date of subscribing.  She was unable to furnish any receipt. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - LONGFORD TEACHER'S ABSENCE. 
     
      
       asked the Minister   for Education whether he is aware that the principal teacher of St. Bernard's National School, Clonbroney Parish, County Longford, has been absent from the school, since September, 1927; and whether he can state what arrangements have been made for substitution in the absence of the principal teacher. 
     
     
      
       The principal teacher of the school referred to has been attending a course of lectures, in preparation for a degree, at University College, Dublin, since the 10th October, 1927, and a qualified substitute served from that date to the 20th January last. 
       Since the latter date efforts have been made to secure an eligible substitute in succession, but, owing to the dearth of suitable persons, they have been unsuccessful. 
       The Department is in communication with the manager and the teacher on the subject. 
     
     
      
       Will the Minister state what recompense is proposed to be made to the children who have lost the use of a qualified teacher in the meantime? 
     
     
      
       It happens that in this particular school there is no great urgency on this point, though we have communicated with the manager and the teacher.  The school in question was formed a couple of years ago by the amalgamation of two two-teacher schools with the result that there were kept on four teachers, though the number actually required was three competent teachers. 
     
     
      
       I did not ask for such an elaborate statement. 
     
     
      
       Probably not.  I am sorry I gave the Deputy too much information. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - USE OF NATIONAL SCHOOL. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that a dance was held on the 6th January, 1928, in St. Bernard's National Schools, Clonbroney Parish, County Longford; and whether this   dance was held by or under the auspices of a political organisation. 
     
     
      
       I have communicated with the manager of the schools, who gives his assurance that they have never been used for a dance under the auspices of a political organisation. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - REGISTRATION OF SHIPPING. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he can state what percentage of the total tonnage of ships trading with ports in this country is registered in the Free State; and what is the total amount of income tax paid to the Free State Exchequer by shipping companies trading with this country, whether registered here or elsewhere. 
     
     
      
       The tonnage of vessels registered in Saorstat Eireann which entered and cleared at Saorstat ports in 1927 constituted 25 per cent. of the total tonnage entered and cleared. 
       I would request the Deputy to put down the second part of the question as a separate question addressed to the Minister for Finance since the desired information is not in my possession. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - INTERNATIONAL AERODROME. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the Government have in contemplation the establishment of an aerodrome in the Free State for use in the development of aerial communication between the Free State and other countries in Europe and America; whether any correspondence has passed on this subject between the Free State and other Governments; and whether, in any consideration of the subject he will take into account the exceptional geographical advantages possessed by the area of West Cork as the site for such aerodrome. 
     
     
      
       Steps have been taken whenever a request was received for aerodrome facilities to provide them, and those for whom they were provided have expressed their satisfaction with   the arrangements made.  The nature and location of the facilities required depend on the purpose for which a particular flight is being undertaken, and the time has scarcely arrived for developing a special aerodrome as a general base for communication with other countries.  No requests for the establishment of such a base have been received from other Governments, but if they are received, such advantages as are possessed by the area of West Cork, as well as other areas, will duly be taken into account.  Baldonnel, as the recognised aerodrome for customs purpose, is the only one at which aeroplanes from other countries are at present permitted to land. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ALLEGED MEETINGS IN GARDA SIOCHANA BARRACKS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that meetings of the Cumann na nGaedheal political organisation have been held in Ballinamuck Garda Siochana Barrack at regular intervals during the past two years; that this barrack has been open to visitors, sometimes as many as ten or twelve, at all times of the day or night within the same period; and, if so, whether steps will be taken to have these alleged irregularities discontinued. 
     
     
      
       I have made inquiries in this matter and I am satisfied that there is no foundation for the statement that meetings of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation have been held in Ballinamuck Garda Siochana Barrack during the past two years or that any civilians frequent the barrack except on business. 
     
     
      
       Is that due to the fact that the only members of Cumann na nGaedheal in Ballinamuck are the members of Garda Siochana? 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - SEIZURE OF CATTLE (CO. CLARE). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Justice whether he will state (a) why five head of two-year-old cattle, the property of John McGrath, Oaghty, Kilfenora, County Clare, were seized   by the Sheriff on October 25th, 1927; (b) what amount of money was realised on the sale of the cattle; and (c) whether the Sheriff had a Court decree authorising this seizure, and, if not, by what authority the seizure was made. 
     
     
      
       I am informed that the Under-Sheriff of Clare made no seizure against the person named in the Deputy's question on the date cited, but that on the 22nd of October, 1925, the Under-Sheriff seized five head of cattle, the property of John McGrath, on foot of a decree at the suit of John Lahiff, of Whitemount, Kilnaboy.  The cattle seized were sold and a sum of £49 was realised by the sale. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - DEATH OF SOLDIER. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that Private Leo Friel, No. 68032, 9th Infantry Battalion, who was found shot while on guard duty at Collins Barracks, Dublin, on February 16th, 1928, had been posted to guard duty immediately on his discharge from hospital; that the inquest was held without his brothers having an opportunity of viewing or identifying the body; that the clothing of deceased was not produced at the inquest; and that the body was sent by rail to Derry without having been properly bandaged, following the post-mortem examination. 
     
     
      
       I am aware that the late Private Leo Friel was detailed to mount guard the day after his discharge from hospital, medically fit for duty.  The identification of his body and the production of his clothing at the inquest do not appear to be matters for me.  All relevant information was made available to the coroner.  The allegation that the body was not properly bandaged after the post-mortem examination is unfounded. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - MILITARY RESTRICTIONS IN FERMOY. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Defence whether he can state (a) the number of men carrying out military   manoevres in Kilworth Camp at present, and the reasons, if any, for declaring the town of Fermoy out of bounds for such troops; and (b) whether he will take steps to remove such restrictions in view of the fact that neither Mitchelstown nor Kilworth is out of bounds. 
     
     
      
       The number of men at present undergoing training in Kilworth Camp is six hundred and twenty.  The town of Fermoy is not out of bounds to any of them.  It is, however, beyond the distance, namely, three miles, that the men may go from the camp without a pass. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - TOWN CLERKSHIP OF CASTLEBLAYNEY. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that Patrick Daly, late Acting Town Clerk, Castleblayney, was suspended on 8th November, 1927, by Castleblayney Urban District Council; that, while the suspension has not since been removed, he has not been dismissed; that he was called to Dublin to sit for a competitive examination for the position of Town Clerk on the 27th November, 1927; that an advertisement for applicants for the position appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; on the 29th December, 1927, from the Local Appointments Commission; that, according to the terms of the advertisement, no qualifying or competitive examination was required; whether he will state if the qualifying examination is usually dispensed with by the Local Appointments Commission in filling such vacancies; and why no appointment was made on the result of the examination held on the 27th November, 1927. 
     
     
      
       I am informed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that Patrick Daly, late Acting Town Clerk, Castleblayney, was suspended from duty on 8th November, 1927.  His suspension was confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health on 12th December, 1927. 
     
     The office of Town Clerk is an office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, applies, and Mr. Daly was filling the post temporarily   pending a recommendation from the Local Appointments Commissioners which issued on 23rd March, 1928.  The permanent appointment was duly made on 2nd April, 1928. 
     Mr. Daly was an applicant for the vacant post.  He was summoned to Dublin to sit for a written qualifying examination on 2nd December, 1927. This written test was followed by an interview before a board of selection. From the result of the examination and interview, the Local Appointments Commissioners decided that there was no candidate competent or qualified to discharge the duties attaching to the position.  The position was accordingly re-advertised on 29th December, 1927. In the terms of the re-advertisement it was prescribed that candidates would be required to possess a good general education, which was tested at the interview. 
     It is the general practice of the Commissioners to prescribe for posts of this nature that applicants shall have attained such standard of general education as they deem necessary for the efficient discharge of the duties attaching to the office.  Written qualifying examinations have been held, where necessary, to determine whether this standard has been reached by applicants, but experience has shown that this method is cumbrous and costly and involves considerable delay, and it has been found that, save in exceptional cases, the standard of education can be satisfactorily determined by oral examination at the interview.  The Commissioners, of course, reserve to themselves the option of setting written tests whenever they deem such a course to be necessary or desirable. 
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - THURLES CLAIMANT TO OLD AGE PENSION. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will state why the recommendation of the local Old Age Pensions Committee that a pension at the rate of 9/- (nine shillings) per week be paid to Denis Darcy, Imockawn, Thurles, County Tipperary. has not been put into effect. 
     
     
     
      
       An appeal was received in June, 1927, arising out of the claim of Mr. Denis Darcy, Allengort, Drombane, Thurles, for an old age pension, which may be the case referred to by the Deputy. While the appeal was under consideration he was visited by an inspector of the Department.  From his report it was considered that means had not been fully disclosed.  As it was not clear they were within the statutory limit for the receipt of a pension the claim was disallowed on 27th July, 1927. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - STREET TRADING BYE-LAWS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, notwithstanding any previous inquiry, he will now cause a local inquiry to be held pursuant to his powers under the Street Trading Act, 1926, for the purpose of reviewing the bye-laws made by the Commissioners of the County Borough of Dublin, which prohibit absolutely stall trading in certain streets formerly and customarily used for such stall trading for upwards of 30 years, in the said County Borough of Dublin, and to have the views of the street traders and any interested parties adequately heard, and their case for the alteration and repeal of the existing bye-laws properly presented. 
     
     
      
       The Minister for Local Government and Public Health has no power to alter or rescind bye-laws made by local authorities and duly confirmed by him.  The question of holding an inquiry for that purpose does not therefore arise.  I would refer the Deputy to the replies given on the 16th February and 31st March, 1927, on this subject. 
     
     
      
       In view of the fact that these people's means of living are practically threatened, and that they failed to attend the first inquiry, because the opportunity was allowed to slip, simply because no one realised the seriousness of it, would the Minister not consider the advisability of having an inquiry? 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - TEMPORARY CLOSING OF DUBLIN LIBRARIES. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the Dublin Borough Commissioners have decided to close the Dublin Public-Libraries in rotation from May to September of this year; that the loss of service thereby caused to the public is very considerable; and whether he will make representations to the Commissioners with a view to having these libraries re-opened.

     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - CHINESE BACON. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether his attention has been called to a statement in the &ldquo;Report on the Pork and Bacon Trades in England and Wales,&rdquo; published by the British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, to the effect that Chinese bacon exported to England meets with little or no demand there, and is mainly re-exported to Ireland; and whether he will state what steps, if any, he proposes to take to see that this article, if offered for sale in this country, will have a distinguishing mark to show its origin. 
     
     
      
       I have seen the statement in question, and would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on 23rd February last to a similar question put by Deputy M. O'Reilly regarding the sale of foreign produce, with particular reference to bacon.  The Deputy will presumably have noted that in the British Report referred to by him it is mentioned that, in spite of the large number of pigs in that country, the exportable surplus of Chinese pig meat is small, pork being the staple meat of the Chinese people. It appears improbable, therefore, that Chinese bacon finds its way into this country in any considerable quantity. 
     
     In the reply given to Deputy O'Reilly I pointed out that the powers needed would be provided under the   Merchandise Marks Act, under which regulations could be made, so that imported goods would only be sold if there was an indication of the country of origin. 
     
      
       Would the Minister consult the evidence given before the Tribunal on Prices as to the importation of Chinese bacon into this country by various persons connected with the trade? 
     
     
      
       I read that evidence.  It is not indicated there even approximately what amount of Chinese bacon comes into the country.  My own belief is that there is very little coming in. 
     
     
      
       Even if the quantities that come in are small I think that people are entitled to protection in view of the reports that we get as to the curing and packing of this bacon. 
     
     
      
       There may be regulations made under the Merchandise Marks Bill, but that Bill has not been introduced.  When it is passed there will be power there to make regulations. 
     
     
      
       A large quantity has been imported. 
     
     
      
       It is impossible to find out the amount imported, but my own view is that, compared with the amount of Canadian, American and Danish bacon that comes in, it is absolutely negligible. 
     
     
      
       Can the Minister state when the Merchandise Marks Bill will be introduced? 
     
     
      
       That is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He has taken charge of the Bill. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - DIVISION OF DUBLIN LANDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether, in the division of certain untenanted lands upon the Stafford Estate at Montpelier, Bohernabreena, an area of 38 acres, or approximately one-third of the lands divided, was granted, together with a valuable quarry, to a Mrs. Doyle; whether this lady's husband already held a farm of 51 acres   from the Land Commission; and, if so, upon what grounds the lands referred to above were granted to her; whether, of the lands granted to Mrs. Doyle, some 16 acres consisted of lands which had been held by another tenant on the estate and by his father and grandfather continuously for over 60 years; and whether representations had been made to the Land Commission regarding the injustice of granting those lands to Mrs. Doyle, instead of to their original holder. 
     
     
      
       These untenanted lands of Montpelier comprising 140 acres of the lands which had been let by the former owners under eleven months letting in 3 lots to two grazing tenants, viz.: Mrs. Kate Flood, wife of Bernard Flood and the reps. of Edward Byrne, were acquired by the Land Commission under the Land Act, 1923.  Mrs. Flood held the major portion of the lands, with permission to quarry. 
       In the division of the lands Mrs. Kate Flood was allotted and signed an agreement to purchase a parcel of land containing 46a. 1r. 14p. (which includes a quarry) to be consolidated with her parent uneconomic holding containing 5a. 2r. 9p., the Poor Law Valuation of which is £4 5s. 0d., and is situate at Friarstown Lower on the Cobbe Estate. Her husband, Bernard Flood, is tenant of a holding consisting of 24a. 3r. 19p. (together with a right of turbary) the Poor Law Valuation of which is £7 and is situate on the Cobbe Estate above referred to. 
       The Commissioners in dividing the lands had to consider two alternatives; either to allot them to the grazing tenants or to utilize them for the purpose for which they were purchased, viz., the relief as far as possible of congestion. 
     
     In Mrs. Flood's case the real applicant is her son, John Coughlan, by her first marriage, but as the holding which has a Poor Law Valuation of £4 5s. 0d. is in her name, the enlargement of 46a. 1r. 14p. had also to be in her name in order that it could be consolidated with the holding.  In giving this enlargement the Commissioners considered it necessary that it should include a proportion   of tillage land, and accordingly she was allotted a part of the land formerly let to reps.  Edward Byrne.  Mrs. Flood married a second time and there is a family of five children by this marriage to be provided for. 
     The Byrnes live on a holding which has a Poor Law Valuation of £13 and which was vested in the name of Michael Byrne.  He was allotted 15a. 1r. 11p. of arable land on the above estate, for the enlargement of and to be consolidated with the parent holding in respect of which he signed a Purchase Agreement. 
     The area of the land held by Mrs. Flood and not allotted to her was considerably greater than the area held by Byrne and not allotted to him. 
     The residue of the lands was utilized to provide enlargements of 40a. 1r. 5p. and 38a. 1r. 17p. for two small holders &mdash;the valuations of whose holdings are £6 15s. 0d. and £3 15s. 0d. respectively. 
     
      
       Is not the real point of the matter this, that land which has been held by a family as tenants for practically sixty years, held on the eleven-months' system, admittedly, was given to another applicant after these people had made the land? 
     
     
      
       Yes.  The only thing considered in the distribution of land is the quality.  Allottees must be given portions of land suited for tillage purposes. That was a consideration that the Commissioners had in mind when they divided the land. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - RETENTION OF CO. DUBLIN FARM. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state the grounds on which the Land Commission propose to retain the farm at Hilltown, Swords, on the Staples and Molesworth Estates, which is held by Mrs. Menton under a judicial tenancy; whether he is aware that this farm was originally held by Mrs. Menton's husband, who died intestate, leaving nine children, all of whom would be entitled to share with Mrs. Menton in their father's interest in the land; and whether, having regard to this circumstance,   it is still proposed to retain Mrs. Menton's holding. 
     
     
      
       The lands referred to comprise a holding of 279 acres, situate in the townlands of Hilltown and Rathingle, and held by Mrs. Margaret Menton (widow) at a rent of £310 6s. 5d. as tenant on the estate of Sir J. Molesworth Staples, Co. Dublin.  The purchase money of the holding being over £3,000, this holding is automatically retainable under Section 28 (6) (a) of the Land Act, 1923, and after having had special inquiries made the Land Commission published a notice of their intention to apply for an order to the Judicial Commissioner authorising the resumption of the holding for the relief of congestion.  An objection was lodged by the tenant and, after hearing in Court, was disallowed. 
     
     
      
       Are the facts, as stated, that the husband of Mrs. Menton died intestate? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       If that is so, does she not hold the land in trust for the children? 
     
     
      
       That is a matter to be, decided judicially.  If she is not satisfied that the decision was right she can appeal to the Judicial Commissioner. 
     
     
      
       In view of the fact that Mrs. Menton is not to be allowed the same privilege as Mrs. Doyle, how do the Commissioners reconcile the decisions in both instances? 
     
     
      
       She has got all the advantages of the Land Act. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - RIGHT OF WAY. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether steps will be taken by the Land Commission to give John Bryant, Ballinree, Cashel, who was recently allotted a holding on the Smith-Barry estate, a right of way for carting between his yard and his farm. 
     
     
      
       The yard and farm buildings are situate on the lands allotted to John Bryant, and there is   no necessity for the provision of a right of way. 
     
     
      
       Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this man has no right of way for bringing a car, either from the road or from his yard, to his farm, that he has reported the matter to the Land Commission several times, and that he cannot get any reply? 
     
     
      
       I am perfectly satisfied that he has a right of way to his farm. 
     
     
      
       He has no road by which he can bring a car to his farm. I am perfectly satisfied that he has not, because I visited the place and saw that he has not. 
     
     
      
       I am perfectly satisfied, from the information at my disposal, that no matter what sort of right of way Bryant got he would not be satisfied. 
     
     
      
       If he was allowed the right of way that was there before the farm was divided he would be satisfied.  What further steps will be taken? 
     
     
      
       No further steps will be taken.  He has a right of way already. 
     
     
      
       He refuses to pay rent until he gets it. 
     
     
      
       That is a matter that can be decided. 
     
     
      
       Will you consider the question of giving him an aeroplane? 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - LEASEHOLD FARMS AND LAND PURCHASE. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether it is intended to extend to persons holding leasehold farms the benefits of the Land Purchase scheme. 
     
     
      
       If the question refers to leasehold for lives or years renewable for ever or for terms of which sixty years or more were unexpired at the passing of the Land Act, 1923, such leasehold interests in non-congested districts counties are provided for by Section 38 of the Land Act of 1923 and   by Section 11 of the Land Act, 1927, and in congested districts counties by Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923. 
     
     
      
       Am I to understand that farmers who hold lands for a period of years, or for the lives of certain people, and who are not in a congested area, cannot avail of the facilities under the land scheme? 
     
     
      
       Yes, they can.  They can apply to the Land Commission to have their cases considered according to Section 11 of the Land Act of 1927. A number of such applications have been received.

     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - DOUGLAS (CO. LONGFORD) ESTATE. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries if he will state whether he is aware that one of the graziers (Mr. James McCann), on the estate of Colonel Sholto Douglas, Newtown-Forbes, County Longford, has been allotted a large farm in County Meath, and in addition, has received a large holding and residence on the Douglas estate; that this gentleman and his brother are owners of extensive holdings in the same parish and county, and of a large farm in County Roscommon; and, if so, whether, in view of the congestion in the neighbourhood, he will see that all land available on this ranch is divided amongst the people. 
     
     
      
       The lands referred to were tenanted lands consisting of three holdings on the Douglas estate, County Longford, held by Michael and James McCann, and the Land Commission has resumed possession of two of the holdings and part of the third holding on which the dwelling house stands.  The residue of the third holding, consisting of 67a. 0r. 30p., is being resold to James McCann under the Land Purchase Acts.  The total area thus resumed is 259a. 3r. 35p. 
       As a further consideration for the surrender of the lands on the Douglas estate, which were urgently required for the relief of congestion, the Land Commission have agreed to give in exchange a new holding in the townland of Culcor, in County Meath, consisting of about 246 acres.  Michael McCann is the registered owner of a holding of 51a. 0r. 53p. situate in the townland of Killeen East, County Roscommon. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - PEPPER ESTATE (CO. MEATH). 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether, and, if so, when   it is intended to acquire, for distribution, the lands of the late Colonel Pepper, near Gormanstown, County Meath. 
     
     
      
       There are no proceedings pending in the Land Commission for the acquisition of these lands.  The Commissioners, however, propose to make inquiries as regards them. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - MEATH DRAINAGE RATE. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he is aware that the tenant 95/5778, on the R.H. Fowler Estate, near Enfield, County Meath, was charged £1 4s. 3d. by the Ballinakill Drainage Board, though he was not vested until the 17th November, 1927, some time after the Board had ceased to function; and whether he will state for what reason the Land Commission, as previous holder, did not pay this charge. 
     
     
      
       If the tenant purchaser referred to applies to the Land Commission for repayment of the amount of the rate referred to and forwards the Collector's receipt, his application will be considered favourably. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - ACQUISITION AND DIVISION OF MAYO LANDS. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state what steps, if any, the Land Commission has taken to acquire the lands of Kilmurry, situate on the Walsh Estate, County Mayo, for the relief of congestion in that area. 
     
     
      
       The lands referred to comprise a holding situate in the townlands of Kilmurrymore and Kilmurrybeg on the estate of Edward C. Walsh. Co. Mayo, in the occupation of Francis C. Walsh as tenant, held under lease. The estate is being dealt with under the Land Act, 1923, and the Land Commission will consider the advisability of retaining and resuming this holding. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state what progress the Land Commission has made in negotiations for the acquisition of the lands of Castlehill, situate   on the Walsh Estate, County Mayo, for the relief of congestion in that area. 
     
     
      
       Proceedings were instituted under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, for the acquisition of the lands of Castlehill and the lands were published in a provisional list of lands which, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, would become vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day.  The owner lodged an objection to the acquisition of these lands by the Land Commission. His objection was heard in court and allowed. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state the cause of the delay in the division of the lands of Errew, the property of the late Mr. W.O. Bourke, Ballintubber, County Mayo. 
     
     
      
       The lands of Errew were vested in the Land Commission on the 1st instant.  A scheme for their division is about to be prepared, and the Commissioners hope to be in a position to divide them at the end of the year. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state what steps the Land Commission have taken to acquire the farm at Richmond, Crossmolina, owned by Mr. Charles Daly, Coachfield, Castlebar; and whether he is aware that the Land Commission have been informed that the owner is willing to sell, and that the land is much needed for the relief of congestion in that locality. 
     
     
      
       The lands referred to, comprising 122a. 3r. 17p., in the townland of Richmond, have been purchased under the Land Purchase Acts and are subject to a land purchase annuity, and the Land Commission do not propose at present to take any action with a view to their acquisition. 
     
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state when the Land Commission will divide the lands of Mountcormac, on the Coyne Estate, County Mayo. 
     
     
      
       Proceedings have been   instituted under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, for the acquisition of the lands of Ballynalynagh, containing 75a. 3r. 14p. on the estate of Frank O'Boyle, formerly the Coyne Estate. The lands were published in a provisional list of lands which, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, will become vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day, and the price thereof has been fixed.  The Land Commission hope to be in a position to divide these lands at the end of the year. 
     
   
   
     CEISTEANNA&mdash;QUESTIONS.   ORAL ANSWERS. - LIMERICK LAND ANNUITIES. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state the total amount of land annuities due in County Limerick up to the 31st December, 1928. 
     
     
      
       The arrears of land purchase annuities in County Limerick on the 31st January, 1928 (the date up to which the accounts have been made up) amounted to £42,216. 
       The latest returns show that the arrears now amount to £35,202.

     PRIVATE BUSINESS. - A CORRECTION. 
     
      
       With reference to the Official Reports, which are, I understand, published under the supervision of the Ceann Comhairle, I want to draw attention to the headings under which my motion for leave to present a petition in accordance with the provisions of Article 48&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       The Deputy has not given notice of this, and I do not know what it is about. 
     
     
      
       I want to say that the heading under which the debate was given in the first instance was &ldquo;Petition to Amend Constitution.&rdquo; Of course it is nothing of the kind.  It is, if anything, a petition to give effect to the Constitution.  It was changed in the next issue to &ldquo;Petition for Initiation of Constitutional Amendments.&rdquo; That is nearer to it.  It should be &ldquo;Petition for Provision for the Initiative.&rdquo; In the next issue there is a reversion to the original form&mdash;&ldquo;Petition to Amend Constitution.&rdquo; I just want to say that I think these are quite misleading headings. 
     
     
      
       I have had no notice of this, and I do not know if the Deputy means to say that the headings are intentionally misleading or are simply incorrect. 
     
     
      
       They are misleading to anybody who looks at them. If you were to take the substance of the petition or the matter dealt with under that heading you would be misled. 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy had drawn attention to it in the usual way it would, of course, have been altered in the bound volume. 
     
     
      
       Could it be said that they were unintentionally illuminating? 
     
     
      
       I formally draw attention to this, and I should like to see a change made in the bound volume. 
     
     
     
      
       It is never done in that way. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy has taken an extraordinary way of doing a simple thing.  He could have the matter changed by simply mentioning it.  I think none of the three headings is a correct heading, but the Deputy will realise that the Editor of the Debates and the official reporters have to deal with a great variety of subjects, and have to put up headings to them.  They are not necessarily constitutional experts and cannot always hit on the correct heading to put to a matter of this kind or any other kind.  However, the matter is susceptible of easy remedy.

       Section 1, sub-section (1).  The words &ldquo;actually used or is&rdquo; deleted in line 23 and the word &ldquo;structurally&rdquo; substituted therefor. 
       This is a drafting amendment in order better to define the buildings to which this Bill applies. 
       Question put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 2:&mdash; 
     
     Section 1, sub-section (1).  All from and including the words &ldquo;the rack-rent&rdquo; in line 29 deleted down to the end of the sub-section and the following words substituted therefor: &ldquo;in respect of the small dwelling in relation to which the expression is used a rent equal to or exceeding the valuation under the Valuation Acts of such dwelling or the person who would for the time being so receive in respect of such dwelling a rent equal to or exceeding the said   valuation if such dwelling were let at such a rent.&rdquo; 
     The Seanad considered that under the present standard of valuation a person receiving a rent amounting to two-thirds of the valuation, and not more than that, had not sufficient interest in the premises to be titled an owner under this Bill.  I have gone into the matter and for the purposes of the Bill it does not make any difference to the extent to which the Bill will apply, and I suggest that we should agree with the amendment. 
     Question put and agreed to. 
     
      
       I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 3:&mdash; 
       Section 4, sub-section (4).  Before sub-section (4) a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash; 
       (4) Whenever a rate is made by virtue of this section on the owner of one or more small dwellings, the rating authority by whom such rate is made shall furnish to such owner (as the case may require) particulars of such rate in respect of such small dwelling or separate particulars of such rate in respect of each such small dwelling, and such particulars shall be deemed to have been duly so furnished if the same are transmitted by post to or left at the address appearing in the rate book of such owner or, where such address is uncertain or the address of such owner does not appear in the rate book, are transmitted by post to or left at the small dwelling to which they relate. 
     
     This secures explicitly that the owners of property of this kind will receive a definite notice of the rate being struck in respect of each particular house. Ordinarily that would be the case, but the Seanad desired it to be explicit in the Bill.  It also arranges the date on which certain things will hang.  It arranges that the demand for the rates will be transmitted by post, and the date upon which the demand will be transmitted by post is a date that will affect the date upon which the owners will increase their rents; will have a   bearing on the date on which the rate collector can take steps to garnishee for rates in the case of bad pays, and also on the date in respect of which nine-tenths of the rates will be accepted as full payment of the rates if the owner pays the rates before that particular day. 
     Question put and agreed to. 
     
      
       I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 4:&mdash; 
       Section 4, sub-section (5).  Before the word &ldquo;Every&rdquo; in line 44 the words &ldquo;Save as is otherwise provided by this Act&rdquo; inserted. 
       This is a drafting amendment relating to amendment 5. 
       Question put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 5:&mdash; 
       New Section.  Before Section 5 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash; 
       5.&mdash;(1) Save as is otherwise provided by this section a rate made by virtue of this Act on an owner of a small dwelling who is not beneficially entitled to such small dwelling shall not be recoverable from such owner. 
       (2) Whenever a rate is made by virtue of this Act on the owner of a small dwelling and such owner is not beneficially entitled to such small dwelling and such rate is in arrear and unpaid for whichever of the following periods is the longer, that is to say, four months from the making of such rate or three months from the furnishing in accordance with this Act to such owner of particulars of such rate, the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say, 
     
     (a) it shall be lawful for the rate collector by whom such rate is collectable to serve either personally or by post on such owner a notice restraining him for so long as any part of such rate remains unpaid from paying to the person beneficially entitled to such small dwelling any rents or profits received (whether before or after the service   of such notice) by such owner out of or in respect of such small dwelling; 
     (b) when such notice has been served such owner shall, to the extent of all rents and profits issuing out of such small dwelling and either received by him before and still in his hands at the service of such notice or received by him after such service, be liable to pay such rate and the same shall be recoverable from him accordingly by all or any of the remedies authorised by this Act; 
     (c) the receipt of a rate collector by whom such rate is collectable for a payment made by such owner on account of the said rate after the service of such notice on him shall, as against the person beneficially entitled to such small dwelling and notwithstanding any direction given by such person, be a good discharge to such owner for moneys received by him for the use of or in trust for such person up to the amount of such payment; 
     (d) if such notice as aforesaid cannot conveniently be served on such owner or the rating authority by whom such rate was made is of opinion (whether before or after the service of such notice) that the amount of such rate so in arrear or some part of such amount is or probably will be irrecoverable from such owner, it shall be lawful for the rate collector by whom such rate is collectable to serve either personally or by post on the occupier of such small dwelling a notice stating the amount of the said rate then unpaid and requiring such occupier to pay to such rate collector or his successor in office all rent then due or thereafter to become due by him to such owner until the said amount of the said rate is by such payment or otherwise discharged; 
     (e) the service of such notice as aforesaid on such occupier shall operate to transfer to such rate collector and his successors in office the exclusive right to recover, receive and give a discharge for the rent required by such notice to be   paid to such rate collector or his successor in office. 
     It will be remembered that under Section 1 (1) the agent collecting rents for another person is classified as an owner for the purpose of the Bill. It was felt in the Seanad that an owner of that particular kind, who was not himself benefiting from the rents, ought not to be placed legally in a position in which, say, his property could be seized for non-payment of the rates. The introduction of this amendment is for the purpose of allowing the rent of a particular house to be garnisheed either through the agent, or if not through him, through the occupier, for the purpose of paying off the rates due on a particular house.  There are good grounds why it should be possible to do that, and I recommend that we should agree with this amendment. 
     
      
       This is a rather dangerous amendment from our point of view, and unless better reasons are given as to why we should accept it I think it should not be accepted.  It opens up very great possibilities to a landlord who wants to make the position very difficult, particularly for a local authority. 
     
     
      
       I do not think there is any danger in connection with that.  If there is a landlord who does not pay the rates, then power is taken to garnishee the rent for that particular house, either through the agent, if there is an agent, or through the occupier, if there is no agent. I was, personally, very desirous that we should not introduce any thing into the Bill that might get the occupier of the house into conflict with his landlord, but this only applies to a case where you have not only a bad landlord but a bad agent, so that the likelihood of trouble arising for the occupier with the landlord, simply because power is taken to garnishee the rents through the occupier, is very slight. 
     
     
      
       I do not know about its being very slight.  The Minister talks about bad landlords and bad agents as if they did not exist or are very few in numbers.  That is not my experience. 
     
     
     
      
       They like to keep out of legal troubles, and do not like to have their rents garnisheed. 
     
     
      
       If the Minister is satisfied that in the first place it is not going to bring the occupier into conflict with the landlord, and in the second place that it is not going to give added trouble to the local authority or the rate collectors I am not going to press my objection. 
     
     
      
       I think there is very little danger of that considering that it only applies to premises where the rent is collected by an agent and therefore a person not beneficially entitled to the income from those particular dwellings. 
       Question put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 6: 
       Section 5, sub-section (1).  The words &ldquo;next after the making of such rate&rdquo; deleted in lines 1-2 and the words &ldquo;hereinafter specified&rdquo; substituted therefor. 
     
     
      
       This is only a drafting amendment in relation to amendment No. 7. 
       Question agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 7. 
       Section 5, sub-section (2).  Before sub-section (2) a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(2) The twelve months mentioned in the foregoing sub-section shall be the twelve months commencing at whichever of the following times is the later, that is to say, the expiration of one month from the making of the rate or the expiration of fourteen days from the furnishing in accordance with this Act to the owner of the small dwelling in relation to which the said twelve months are being calculated of particulars of such rate in respect of such small dwelling.&rdquo; 
     
     This enables a definite date to be fixed in respect of which in any rating area an increase of rent will take place.  This   fixes the date on which the landlord in regard to any particular rating area will make the addition to the rents in respect of rates for the following twelve months. 
     Question agreed to. 
     
      
       I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 8: 
       New section.  Before Section 9 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;9.&mdash;(1) Whenever the owner of a small dwelling who is not also the occupier of such dwelling pays to the rating authority or to a person on their behalf nine-tenths of the amount of a rate made by virtue of this Act on him in respect of such dwelling within three months after the making of such rate or within two months after the furnishing to him in accordance with this Act of particulars of such rate in respect of such dwelling, such rate shall be deemed to have been fully paid and satisfied by such payment and such payment shall be accepted by such rating authority or such person accordingly. 
       (2) The provisions of this section shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the provisions of any other enactment (whether public, general, local, or personal, public or private) enabling a rate to be discharged by payment of a fraction thereof within a limited time, but not so as to entitle any person to relief under this section and under such other enactment in respect of the same rate.&rdquo; 
     
     This amendment provides that if within three months after the striking of the rate or within two months of the furnishing of the demand notes to the owner nine-tenths of the amount due is paid up that will be accepted in full discharge of the rates.  A rather strong case was made out as to the responsibility that fell upon the owners under this Bill both in respect of the extra work it threw upon them collecting the rates weekly or monthly and making themselves the channel for paying the rates and the liability   that fell upon them through possible loss, that is, that they were made liable for the payment of rates that they may never collect.  I was persuaded that there was a case for allowing owners who pay rates in respect of small dwellings some rebate.  This proposal is to give them a rebate of one-tenth, provided that the full rates are paid within three months of the making of the rate or within two months of the receipt of the demand note, whichever date is longest.  It is to be borne in mind in connection with this that, in respect of dwellings of £6 valuation and under, there is a very big margin of irrecoverable rates.  I have not been able in respect of the country as a whole to get the figures because I was informed it would involve a rather exhaustive inquiry but figures have been examined in respect of certain urban areas and county councils and on a snap check of that kind it was shown that irrecoverable rates in urban districts are approximately 60 per cent. in respect of houses of £6 valuation and under.  In respect of certain counties, at any rate, the amount of irrecoverable rates on houses of £6 valuation and under would approximately amount to 25 per cent. We expect to reduce very much, if not entirely, as a result of our Bill the amount of irrecoverable rates due on small holdings.  Taking that into consideration, I think the rebate we are allowing to owners under this Bill is reasonable. 
     
      
       I am not satisfied that there is any necessity whatever for this rebate.  What the Minister is asking the House to accept is to pay landlords for paying their rates and that we should give them a commission.  The Minister seems to forget what was said in this House before: that prior to the passing of the Local Government Act of 1898 landlords were responsible for the payment of rates on small houses. When the landlords let those houses they took that into consideration and increased the rents accordingly.  After the passing of the 1898 Act many of them refused to continue to pay the rates but they never made a reduction in the rents which were originally fixed in order to cover rates as well as rents and that obtains right up to the present.   If the Minister is prepared to say in the case of an owner or a landlord who pays the rates in respect of a house within three months after the making of the rate that nine-tenths should be accepted in full payment I do not see why the same should not be extended to other ratepayers.  It seems to me that you are making the landlord a present of a bonus.  The Minister talks about irrecoverable rates.  We know quite well that local authorities for many years have suffered quite a lot because of irrecoverable rates.  The landlords got the rents but the rates for the houses for which the landlord received the rents regularly had to be paid by the other ratepayers.  If any persons are entitled to get some refund it seems to me it is the ratepayers that had to make up for the irrecoverable rates.  I think the House ought not to accept this amendment. 
     
     
      
       I am not in agreement with Deputy Morrissey in this matter. He seems to forget that the principle of this Bill is to make the landlord liable for what the tenant is liable at the moment.  That is the principle of the Bill.  The Minister has pointed out to us that the amount of irrecoverable rates from this particular class of property, as embodied in this Bill, is very considerable, as all those who are connected with local authorities know. Now that liability is being transferred to the owner.  The consequence is that the liability for these irrecoverable rates will be materially reduced.  In other words, the transfer of the liabilities is made from the local authority to the owner.  The owner now, under this Bill when it becomes an Act, becomes a collector of rates for the local authority. 
     
     
      
       In respect of his own houses. 
     
     
      
       These rates at the moment are collected by the local authorities and that liability is being transferred to the owner.  Under this Bill the owner, in the discharge of the obligation cast upon him, will have to collect these rates, which at the moment the local authority has to bear the expense   of collecting.  In other words, under this Bill the local authority is freed from the expense of collecting these rates and from the liability which it had up to this in regard to irrecoverable rates.  All that is now transferred to the owner.  Now, because it is proposed to give the owner a small rebate in the nature of a deduction of 10 per cent. for rates that are paid within three months of the striking of the rate or of the receipt of the notices, Deputy Morrissey cries out and says &ldquo;that it is an injustice.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Hear, hear. 
     
     
      
       Let us have some sense of equity in this House. 
     
     
      
       Hear, hear. 
     
     
      
       Let us consider the nature of the liability that is cast on the owner under this Bill.  In return for that, he is to get a deduction of 10 per cent.  Let us for a moment see what the effect of that deduction is. As all ratepayers know, the present system is that rates are paid in two moieties: the first when the rate is struck, and the second on the 1st of October.  Under this Bill, this allowance of 10 per cent. is only payable to the owner if the full amount of the rate&mdash;not the two moieties that people have been accustomed to pay&mdash;is paid within three months.  As I have said, we ought to have some sense of fairness in this matter.  To my mind, this is a small allowance that is made to the owners in view of the additional responsibilities that are cast upon them. I think that it is small in the extreme, and I hope that the House will have a sense of proportion and accept the amendment. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Good talks about equity.  I quite agree with him. 
     
     
      
       It is about time. 
     
     
      
       What I suggest to Deputy Good is that he ought to look at the equity of the matter from the point of view of ordinary tenants who do not own their houses, people who are paying rent for them, and who have   been compelled to pay, in addition to their own rates, the rates on the houses of landlords who were enabled by the Act of 1898 to escape their liabilities. In the town in which I live the irrecoverable rates for the last couple of years amounted to a sum which represented a rate of 1/3d. in the £.  The landlords of these small dwellings, some of them hovels, have continued to get their rents weeks in and week out, while myself and others in the town have had to pay not only the rates for the houses which we occupy but, in addition, rates to the extent of 1/3d. in the £ for houses that were owned by these landlords. 
       It is now suggested that it is unfair that these landlords should be asked to pay the rates in respect of the houses which they own themselves.  One would imagine from what Deputy Good has stated that what was happening was this: that the landlords were now being compelled to pay the rates and that they had no way of recovering them.  The landlord is asked to pay the rates, but it is the occupier of the house who really pays them, because the landlord is getting the power under this Bill to increase the rent by the amount of the rate that he will have to pay.  We know quite well what is going to happen when the Bill becomes law. The landlords will try not only to increase the rents by the amount of the rates that they will have to pay, but a good many of them will double the amount if they can get away with it. There is just this point that I would ask Deputy Good to look at.  Under this Bill the landlord will be entitled to collect from the tenant the full amount of the rate struck, but he will only pay over to the local authorities nine-tenths of the amount which he collects from the tenant.  He can put the other one-tenth in his own pocket. 
     
     
      
       For the expenses incurred in collecting. 
     
     
      
       And for the risks incurred in not collecting. 
     
     
      
       I suggest that there will be no extra expense involved in the collection of the rates, because the rates will be embodied in the rents. The Minister talks about risks.  I   would ask him and the House to recognise this: that a great many landlords in this country have been in receipt of moneys, originally put on to meet rates, during the last 20 or 25 years, to which they are not entitled. 
     
     
      
       That has nothing to do with this Bill. 
     
     
      
       It has something to do with the equities which the Deputy talked about.  I must be taken as against this amendment. 
     
     
      
       I wonder could the Minister give us any idea as to whether the economies in collection will be appreciable in, say, the case of any individual council.  Apart altogether from the question of these small holdings, the proposal has been talked about a good deal all over the country as to whether there could not be a more economical method than the present one of collecting rates, or rather as to whether the expense involved in their collection could not be reduced.  I have heard the question discussed again and again as to whether it would not be worth while giving a commission, or some discount to people who paid their rates before the time they are legally obliged to do so.  We know, of course, that in recent times a number of cases of fraud have occurred on the part of rate collectors.  I am interested to know if the Minister has any information as to whether, under the proposed system, any appreciable economy will accrue in the case of any particular council. 
     
     
      
       As to the question raised by Deputy Moore, that particular matter is getting very careful consideration in the Department.  There are many things in connection with rate collecting that we will have to look to and attend to in the future, perhaps by means of some other kind of legislation. I would not care to drag a discussion of the issues involved in that into this particular Bill where we are getting a very economical way of collecting the rates in respect of a good lot of property and of a difficult class of property.  With regard to figures and in reply to what Deputy Morrissey said, in the case of the Cashel Urban Council,   if we had the machinery working that it is proposed to set up under this Bill in the year 1927-28, that council would have been saved perhaps a sum of £102. At any rate, under the present proposal, the council would have been saved approximately 90 per cent. of that, because out of £120 irrecoverable rates £102 represented rates on the class of property that this particular Bill deals with. 
       In the case of Clonmel, for the two years ending March, 1927, out of £300, the sum of £147 represented rates in respect of this particular class of property. If we had the machinery of this Bill working during these two years, we could have collected that sum of £147, or at all events the greater part of it.  What I suggest, on a full consideration of the matter, is that in respect of these irrecoverable moneys and in respect of getting some other moneys paid in at an earlier part of the year, it is worth while paying the owners of this class of property something.  In the case of Dungarvan, in the County Waterford, for the two years ending March, 1927, out of £940 irrecoverable rates, the whole of the £940 proved to be irrecoverable in respect of this class of property. 
     
     
      
       Might I point out to the Minister that the £900 which will now be collected and paid in by the landlord was before paid in by the ordinary ratepayer?  He had to pay that in addition to the rates on his own house, and he got no ten per cent. rebate. 
     
     
      
       I suggest the ordinary ratepayers will be very pleased indeed if, instead of having to pay in this £940, they get the owners, at a cost of ten per cent. of that amount to pay in the £830 or whatever the exact figure is, because the ordinary ratepayers themselves will be saved the payment of that £830. 
     
     
      
       The ordinary ratepayer would be more pleased if the ten per cent. was not there. 
     
     
      
       In the same way, in the County Mayo for the two years ending March, 1927, the amount of irrecoverable rates on this particular   class of property was £270.  Owners can very well argue that in respect of these irrecoverable rates oil this particular class of property you are asking them to pay rates whether they get them or not.  I am not over impressed by the argument that the landlords do not collect their rents and, therefore, will not be able to collect the rates, but I suggest that the ordinary ratepayer in respect of this class of debt is getting a good bargain if he gets these irrecoverable rates collected at a cost of ten per cent. 
     
     
      
       May I point out that if this amendment is accepted the Minister is going to make the tenant of the house pay a commission on the rates to the landlord? 
     
     
      
       Yes, that is so. 
     
     
      
       I cannot see that argument. 
     
     
      
       Capital must get its price. 
     
     
      
       The rate is levied at present on the full amount, and that is the maximum liability of the tenant. The local authority, in view of the amount which it gets under this arrangement and which it does not get at present and is going to get at an early date, is prepared to make an allowance of 10 per cent. off that rate. To get that allowance the money has to be paid three months after demand for the rates for the whole year.  In other words, the landlord has to pay in cash for the rates nine months before he gets paid for them.  What Deputy Morrissey asks is that the landlords are to have this additional liability cast on them of bearing the burden of the rates, and they are to pay this money to the local authority nine months in advance.  In such a case return for it.  I am afraid if that is to be the attitude of this House with regard to landlords there will in the future be few landlords of houses or any other property. 
     
     
      
       I think Deputy Good's argument is wrong.  Landlords are not being asked to pay nine months in advance.  In such a case   they would be treated as an ordinary ratepayer might be.  Would Deputy Good, or any other person, point out why a landlord should get a special concession which is not available to the ordinary ratepayer who pays his rates within the time limit fixed in the amendment?  There is no question about it, but the landlord will be able to collect these rates in his rents, and that will not cause him any more trouble or additional expense than he is now caused in the collection of the ordinary rents.  I do not think the landlord is entitled to any concession that is riot available to the ordinary man who pays his rates within three months. 
     
     
      
       I agree that the landlord is not compelled, under the section, to pay the rates inside of three months. If he does, it is a question of the local authorities paying two collectors, 10 per cent. to the landlord and 5 per cent. to the rate collectors.  That would all have to come out of the ratepayers' pockets, and I would not agree with such a proposition. 
     
     
      
       I think the amendment is reasonable.  The landlord is asked to collect the liability of another.  It may be argued that the person with a valuation above £6 has to pay the rates in full.  A lot of these rates will not be described as irrecoverable, and they will not be paid for a year or more after a rate is struck.  If a landlord pays out the cash he is kept lying out of his money.  Anybody who has experience of these small houses knows there are losses owing to removals, and if you do not get your rent you will not get the rate that will be struck.  I think the amendment is reasonable, and I am quite sure it will satisfy the local authorities. 
     
     
      
       The advantage which I see to the local authorities in regard to this proposal is that the landlord, for a concession, pays the rates sooner, and the local authorities have the use of the money for carrying on. 
     
     
      
       I have not heard the Minister make any attempt to justify this point, that the landlord will pay into the local authorities only   a certain amount, while he will collect the full amount from the tenants.  Will the Minister give any justification for that? 
     
     
      
       Yes; when concluding, I will justify that. 
     
     
      
       May I point out to those on the other, side that, as I understand it from the statement of the Minister, it is a condition of the rebate of 10 per cent. that this money for the whole year is paid within three months?  Am I correct in that? 
     
     
      
       Certainly. 
     
     
      
       In other words, at the end of three months the utmost the landlord can have collected is 25 per cent. of the total rates if he collects at a weekly rent.  If he gets this 10 per cent. he is called upon to pay up the whole amount of the rates for the year before the expiration of three months. Let us be quite clear about this. Figures are things that may be manipulated. 
     
     
      
       Hear, hear! 
     
     
      
       We will have no manipulation on this occasion, let the Labour Deputies clearly understand, and that is why I am taking the trouble to make my position clear.  The proposal is, as I understand it from the Labour Deputies, that he is to pay down this money to the local authority and get no advantage in return.  If he does not pay within three months, but pays at the end of six months or twelve months, under the proposal he gets no rebate. 
     
     
      
       No more than anyone else. 
     
     
      
       He is acting the part of tax collector for the local authority and gets nothing for it.  If he does not pay the whole of the rates within three months, although he may not have got them, he gets no allowance for the additional, burden cast on him. 
     
     
      
       If the ordinary ratepayer pays within three months, would Deputy Good say that he should get a remission of 10 per cent.? 
     
     
     
      
       In Deputy Morrissey's constituency they paid practically nothing at all.  These rates sometimes amount to only 6d. a week, and the bother of collecting them is more than they are worth.  We are dealing now with valuations under £6 per annum.  Take it that the rate of the local authorities is 10/-.  That means that the total amount of the rates on a house of £6 valuation would be £3.  A shilling a week is, or should be, collected from each of these people in the ordinary way.  What happens is that the rate collector, as he cannot afford the time to go around all the houses, goes to the most of the ratepayers at two periods and calls on them to pay 30/- at the end of the first six months. That is a considerable amount to some of these tenants, who are unable to pay it.  Then at the end of the second moiety he demands £3, but the people are in greater difficulty to pay that than they were in the previous six months, the result being that most of these rates are returned as uncollectable. Under the new regime the landlord will be liable and the rates will be collected from him at all events, but whether he succeeds in getting them from the tenant is another matter. There is another principle which I want to make clear, and it is one which I hope this House will retain, namely, the liability upon the tenant for the payment of rates. 
     
     
      
       It has been retained. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Morrissey and I do not see exactly eye to eye on these matters.  I hold that the principle of making the tenant liable for the payment of rates is very sound, because it gives him an interest in civic life and in those who represent him in the local authority.  Tenants told me under the old regime that it made no difference to them whether the rates were 10/- or £1, as they had to pay the same amount. I want no tenant to be able to say that. I want to have him taking a definite interest in the rates.  The Minister assures us that under this Bill the rates would be a separate charge, and though the liability is to be discharged by the landlord the tenant would still have an   interest in the amount of rates he pays and in seeing that a proper type of person represents him in the local authority. 
     
     
      
       That, I am afraid, is rather wide of the amendment. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Good and Deputy Carey contend that this is a good thing for local authorities, as they will have this money at their disposal, but, so far as I can make out, they are going to pay 28 per cent. per annum.  First of all, they pay 10 on 75, as Deputy Good admitted, and if you take 75 at 10 it is 13? per cent.  That is, assuming that they collect the remainder for nine months in weekly sums.  It means that if the landlord has to collect the rates the money will be outstanding for an average of four and a half months, which means 28 per cent. per annum. 
     
     
      
       My point is that you get in money that you would not otherwise receive. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy apparently did not listen to Deputy Good's speech. 
     
     
      
       I think the principle underlying the amendment is good and equitable.  At one time or another local authorities have had to complain about the amount of rates outstanding, particularly in respect of dwellings of smaller valuation.  It seems reasonable to suggest if this principle be adopted, that there could be a claim made for tenants of houses of a valuation higher than £6 who are not, perhaps, in good circumstances and that, if they pay the rates within three months of the striking of the rate, or within two months after the demand, they should also be given the advantage of the 10 per cent. I think that many, if not most, of the local authorities would be glad to get all rates within three months of the striking of the rate on the understanding that they could do away with rate collectors and have the use of the money for a whole year.  That, however, is probably dragging in a matter which is outside the scope of the Bill.  It has been suggested by some of my friends here who do not like this favouritism in the Bill that it would   perhaps be good for both sides, both for the local authority and the landlord, if the Minister would agree to accept the figure 5 instead of 10 per cent. 
     
     
      
       The principle is wrong. 
     
     
      
       I do not know.  The local authority would be glad to get the money. 
     
     
      
       100 per cent. 
     
     
      
       They do not get 100 per cent.  They do not get it in the Deputy's own town. 
     
     
      
       They get it all right, but the others pay. 
     
     
      
       The others would be glad to pay provided they got some  quid pro quo.   If it would be acceptable to the Minister, perhaps it would be in order to move that reduction in the percentage. 
     
     
      
       This is a Seanad amendment inserted in the Bill and it would be in order, though sufficient notice has not been given, to move an amendment to the Seanad amendment to substitute another figure for 10 per cent. 
     
     
      
       If the Minister would not give facilities for it I do not think there would be any use in moving the amendment. 
     
     
      
       It is a question for the Minister and the Seanad. 
     
     
      
       With regard to giving facilities, I made no provision for this in the original Bill, but I am fully converted to the view that 10 per cent. is a reasonable allowance to make. Someone said that figures have been manipulated, but it is really words that have been manipulated.  No attempt has been made to manipulate figures.  In reply to Deputy O'Kelly, my view of the matter of 10 per cent. is so pronounced, and there are so many Deputies who appreciate the justice of that particular figure I would be averse to leaving the matter over for the moment and giving an opportunity   to amend it.  I stated before, when the matter was before the Dail, that I would recommend the acceptance of all these amendments.  That, I think, was sufficient notice of my intentions for any Deputy who wanted to move amendments. 
     
     
      
       With regard to the point as to whether it should be 5 or 10 per cent., it may be of interest to some Deputies to state that in Dublin houses of £8 valuation and under are allowed a remission of rates if the rates are paid within two months after the beginning of the year.  The remission amounts to between 18 and 20 per cent. The rates in Dublin are divided into a poor rate and a municipal rate.  The poor rate is about one-fourth of the total rate.  A remission of 25 per cent. of the municipal rate is given on houses of £8 valuation and under.  That, if worked out, would mean about 18 or 20 per cent. of the total rate.  Therefore the principle enshrined in this amendment is already in operation in Dublin.  I think that 10 per cent. is a reasonable amount to allow in all the circumstances.  I wish to draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that such a principle is in existence in Dublin and is working well.  One of the conditions is that the house must be in good sanitary condition.  The remission is given on houses under £8 valuation if the owner makes application and certifies that the house is in good condition. 
     
     
      
       Might I ask the Deputy whether the remission he has spoken of is given to the tenant of the house or the landlord? 
     
     
      
       It is given to either one or the other. 
     
     
      
       That is not what is in the Bill. 
     
     
      
       It is given to the owner in this case because the occupiers generally do not make application, and it is only where houses are in good sanitary condition that the remission is allowed.  Sometimes houses are taken out of the list because the houses are not in good sanitary condition. 
     
     
      
       Do I understand   from Deputy Conlan's statement, that the result of the passing of this Bill will be that the rates of a tenant, under 6 valuation, who was paying his rates and got 25 per cent. remission will now be collected by the landlord, who will give him no remission? 
     
     
      
       This Bill does not interfere with the privileges already existing.  That is mentioned in another portion of the Bill. 
     
     
      
       Will the landlord be compelled to give this remission which the tenants are now getting from the Commissioners in Dublin, to the tenants? 
     
     
      
       Perhaps I may answer that.  The position will be that an occupier who was paying a particular rate, reduced by the amount the Deputy speaks of, will not be liable under this Bill to pay more than he was liable for previously, and that in respect of a rate, so reduced, the landlord will not get an additional reduction on that rate, of the 10 per cent. involved in this Bill.  Most of the Deputies who were arguing against this amendment confused a person who pays rates because of his own direct liability with a person who is paying rates for which another person is really liable.  One of the principles kept clear in this Bill is that we are not going to raise from the shoulders of a local government elector a liability to pay rates, and that that shall be definitely shouldered by him in the future as in the past.  The owner of the property on which there is a rate is going to be made the collecting agent.  The owner of that property will perform a certain service in the future.  In the first place he will collect these rates and collect them in a way that is suitable to the occupier, in smaller amounts than would be collected by the rate collector.  He is going to pay them three months after the making of the rate or within two months of the receipt of the demand. He is going to collect rates, a large amount of which have not been recovered up to the present.  In respect of that service we are going to allow him a rebate.  Deputy Dr. Ryan has pointed out that he has already got   interest for three months on money which he collected and that he is going to be out of interest for nine months. As a matter of fact, the periods will be two months and ten months. 
     
     
      
       I accepted Deputy Good's figures. 
     
     
      
       For all practical purposes unless he waits for the last two days after the receipt of the demand to pay up his total rates, he has to pay up the money before he gets it, so that to that extent he is at a   certain loss.  He is also at the loss, which it is argued will exist to some extent, that he will be paying rates in respect of certain properties for which he will not be able to collect rates afterwards.  Generally, I think the bargain that we are making as between the ratepayers and the owners of this class of property is a good one for the ratepayers.

       Message to be sent to the Seanad accordingly. 
     
   
   
     PUBLIC BUSINESS. - MONEY RESOLUTION&mdash;FORESTRY BILL, 1928. 
     The Dail went into Committee on Finance. 
     
      
       I beg to move:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;Go bhfuil se oiriunach a udaru go n-iocfar amach as airgead a sholathroidh an tOireachtas aon chostaisi fe n-a raghfar chun aon Acht do chur in eifeacht a rithfar sa tSioson so chun socru breise agus socru nios fearr do dheanamh chun cur coillte do chur ar aghaidh agus chun an Forestry Act, 1919, do leasu chun na criche sin, chun srian do chur le leaga crann, agus chun socruithe eile do dheanamh a bhaineas leis na nithe sin. 
       That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses incurred in carrying into effect any Act of the present Session to make further and better provision for promoting afforestation and for that purpose to amend the Forestry Act, 1919, to restrict the felling of trees, and to make other provisions connected therewith. 
       Most of the provisions of the Bill deal with administration, and it is anticipated that the additional expenditure involved&mdash;through increased staff in connection with inspections and other matters that will arise out of the passage of the Bill, and the travelling expenses and incidental expenditure&mdash; will amount to about £2,500 per annum.

       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dail agree with the Committee in the Resolution&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     
   
   
     PUBLIC BUSINESS. - FORESTRY BILL, 1928&mdash;THIRD STAGE. 
     The Dail went into Committee. 
     
      
       The Minister has given us very short notice in connection with the amendments.  The Bill takes up four pages and we have five pages of amendments, principally from the Minister. The amendment paper alone seems to be practically a new Bill.  We have not had time to consider the amendments, and in the circumstances it is unfair to take the Committee Stage to-day. 
     
     
      
       As a rule that would be correct, but there was a long debate on the Second Reading. Various suggestions were made.  I have got those suggestions examined in the interval very carefully, and the amendments that I have put in, to a great extent, aim at meeting the points   that were raised in the debate on the Second Reading.  Therefore they are not something absolutely new.  The amendments have for their object the meeting of the points brought forward by various Deputies from practically all Parties.  Those Deputies raised points on the Second Reading and it was to meet their points that I submitted the amendments.  I suggest that we go through the Bill.  I do not think it is possible that that Committee Stage will be concluded to-day and consideration of the amendments can be adjourned to next week.  Then there will be time to put in further amendments. Finally, I suggest that there should be an opportunity given of putting in some amendments on the Report Stage. I agree that the notice is short. 
     
     
      
       We are not criticising the Minister's amendments.  We only got them this morning and some of us have not even read them yet. 
     
     
      
       Perhaps the Minister will make a statement showing us the changes that have been suggested. 
     
     
      
       That is what I intended to do, and I think it will be necessary. 
     
     
      
       It would be quite feasible actually to go through the amendments to-day, but we either will not start at all or we must take the amendments in the ordinary way with whatever explanations may be given in regard to them.  This point arises: It is a question whether amendment No. 1, in the name of Deputy Ryan, is met by amendment No. 2, in the name of the Minister.  If the Deputy thinks it is not he has this remedy: he can simply not move his amendment, or not press it to a decision. In case the Minister's amendment is inserted, as we will assume it will be, then the Bill will be reprinted and Deputy Ryan has the right to put up another amendment.  So long as amendments are not defeated in Committee the Deputy retains the right to put them up again.  The Minister's suggestion is that we go through the Committee Stage to-day and postpone the Report Stage until to-morrow week at the very earliest.  Then if there are   some amendments put up on the Report Stage the Minister would not object to the Dail going into Committee upon them. 
     
     
      
       Quite so. 
     
     
      
       These amendments could be debated to-day and some of them raised again on the Fourth Stage, when Deputies will have seen the Bill as amended.  We could then take further amendments in Committee. Deputies will have every facility for clearing up their points, and that is what the Minister's suggestion amounts to. 
     
     
      
       That is right. 
     
     
      
       That is all right, but in this particular case the difficulty is that I do not know whether the Minister's amendment meets that or not.  I take it the safer thing for me under the circumstances is to withdraw my amendment. 
       Amendment No. 1 not moved. 
     
     
      
       We are allowing the Minister's amendments to be inserted in the Bill before us, so that when the Bill is reprinted it will include the Minister's amendments. 
     
     
      
       I did not say that the Committee would have to allow the amendments to go in.  The amendments have to be explained by the Minister, and there is nothing to prevent Deputies discussing them and opposing them.  Anybody can divide against the amendments, but if the amendments are inserted in the Bill, and if the Minister agrees to reconsider them, the matter will still be open on report. 
     
     
      
       Seeing that the Minister has met the point made by Deputy Ryan, I would personally be in favour of allowing the Minister's amendments to go into the Bill, seeing that he has agreed to another Committee Stage. That would give the Deputies a better opportunity of knowing what was before them rather than have a Bill before them now with several conflicting amendments. 
     
     
      
       The amendments can be debated. 
     
     
     
      
       Yes, and ought to be. There are amendments here which could be debated at once, and there are amendments which meet the obvious points put up by Deputies at the Second Reading. 
     
     
      
       There are two amendments down&mdash;amendments 15 and 18&mdash;that are outside the scope of the Bill and cannot be moved. Amendment 15 proposes to interfere with local taxation and income tax, and amendment 18 deals with the prohibition of the export of timber, which is a matter not dealt with by the Bill. 
     
     
      
       As I said already, Deputy Ryan will have time to consider the amendment between now and the Report Stage. 
       Section 1 agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       (1)  The Minister may from time to time by order made under this sub-section declare that this Act or such part thereof as may be specified in such order shall not apply to any tree of the species named in such order, and whenever such an order is made this Act or such part thereof as may be so specified shall not apply to any tree of such species so long as such order remains unrevoked. 
       (2)  An order made under the foregoing sub-section may be revoked at any time by the Minister by order made under this sub-section. 
     
     This amendment is to insert a new section before Section 2.  Now that Deputies have read Dr. Ryan's amendment they will see that it is exactly the same thing as the amendment I am proposing, with this difference, that mine is more elastic; that it enables the Minister to include certain trees this year as exempted trees, and certain trees next year, as the circumstances change.  It enables him to do that, or alternatively, it enables him, if it is so thought fit, to exclude certain trees or to revoke the order.  It gives the Minister power to do exactly what Deputy Ryan's amendment intended   to give and in addition it gives power to revoke the order. 
     Amendment put and agreed to. 
     New section ordered to be inserted. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     SECTION 4. 
     (1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to cut down or uproot or permit to be cut down or uprooted any trees unless&mdash; 
     (a)  such tree is cut down or uprooted under and in accordance with a licence of the Minister granted under this Act, or 
     (b)  such tree is uprooted for the purpose of transplantation and is actually transplanted, or 
     (c)  such tree is growing or standing in a county borough or urban county district, or 
     (d)  such tree is growing or standing within one hundred feet of any building occupied as a dwelling house or used for housing domestic animals, or 
     (e)  such tree is cut down under section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925) or section 98 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 (No. 27 of 1927), or 
     (f)  such tree is not necessary for the ornament or protection of the holding on which it stands and is cut down with the intention of using the timber thereof for the construction or repair of buildings, fences or other structures on the said holding or another holding belonging to the owner of such first mentioned holding and such timber is actually so used. 
     (2)  If any person cuts down or uproots or permits to be cut down or uprooted any tree in contravention of this section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds for every tree so cut   down or uprooted or permitted to be cut down or uprooted. 
     Amendment 3:&mdash; 
     In sub-section (1) to insert in brackets after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; line 25, the words &ldquo;(subject to the exceptions hereinafter mentioned in sub-section (2) of section 5.).&rdquo;&mdash; Deputy Moore. 
     
      
       I think amendments 3 and 12 go together, so that we can postpone 3 and take the matter at No. 12. 
     
     
      
       I move amendment 4:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (1), line 26, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;uproot&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section in line 53 and substitute the words&mdash; 
       &ldquo;any tree unless, not less than twenty-one days before the commencement of the cutting down or uprooting of such tree, the owner thereof or his predecessor in title or some person on behalf of such owner or predecessor shall have given to the sergeant in charge of the Garda Siochana station nearest to such tree a notice in writing (in this Act referred to as a felling notice) of intention to cut down or uproot such tree. 
       (2)  Every felling notice shall be in the prescribed form and shall state the name and address of the owner by or on whose behalf such notice is given, a place in Saorstat Eireann at which documents may be served under this Act and such other particulars as may be prescribed. 
       (3)  If any person cuts down or uproots or causes or permits to be cut down or uprooted any tree in contravention of this section, he shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds for every tree so cut down or uprooted or caused or permitted to be cut down or uprooted, 
     
     (4)  If any person makes in a felling notice any statement which is false or misleading in any material respect he shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction   thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months. 
     (5)  This section shall not apply to any tree in respect of which a permit has been granted by the Minister under this Act so long as such permit is in force, nor to any tree in respect of which a licence has been granted by the Minister under this Act, nor to any tree the cutting down of which is authorised under section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925), or section 98 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 (No. 27 of 1927), nor to any tree which is the subject of a contract for the sale thereof made before the 1st day of April, 1928 where particulars of such contract verified in the prescribed manner have been furnished to the Minister within one month from the commencement of this Act and such tree is cut down or uprooted within six months from the commencement of this Act. 
     The first paragraph of that amendment is the important paragraph.  The section would then read:&mdash; 
     &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to cut down or uproot any tree unless, not less than 21 days before the commencement of the cutting down or uprooting of such trees, the owner thereof or his predecessor in title or some person on behalf of such owner or predecessor shall have given to the sergeant in charge of the Garda Siochana station nearest to such tree a notice in writing (in this Act referred to as a felling notice) of intention to cut down or uproot such tree.&rdquo; 
     The effect of the change is this: As Section 4 stood in the Bill it was necessary to give notice to the Department of Agriculture, and to refrain from cutting trees until a permit had been granted.  No trees could be cut until a notice had been given and a permit obtained.  I should not have used the word notice previously.  I should have said that no trees could be cut until application had been made to the Department and a permit obtained.  Under this section a tree may be cut if a fell-   ing notice is served, and if the forestry branch of the Department, within 21 days, does not serve notice prohibiting the cutting of such tree.  That is considered by people who have trees to sell, and by any of the interests and organisations I have met, as a fairly important advance.  Notice is served on the nearest Civic Guard barracks, and unless the person hears from the forestry branch within 21 days that person can cut away.  I believe that will facilitate business.  That is the real point of the amendment, and that is the reason the section has been redrafted. This is the final sub-section of Section 4: 
     &ldquo;This section shall not apply to any tree in respect of which a permit has been granted under this Act so long as such permit is in force...&rdquo; 
     In addition to that procedure&mdash;the felling notice which must be served on the nearest policy barracks, which may be obtained at the barrack&mdash;it is open to an owner who, for instance, wants to thin his woods to write direct to the Department for a general permit for forestry purposes and get it.  It is open to the Department to give a general permit to a man who is doing general forestry operations, and he need not adopt the expediency here of sending a felling notice to the Civic Guards.  If he plants a lot of wood, or wants to transplant, the procedure of serving felling notices through the Civic Guards is not so appropriate.  It would be more appropriate to have what I call a permit.  The owner applies direct to the Department and he is more or less independent.  He goes along at his own discretion: 
     ...nor to any tree in respect of which a licence has been granted by the Minister under this Act, nor to any tree the cutting down of which is authorised under Section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925. 
     It might be asked what is the point of the licence.  I have explained the meaning of the permit, the circumstances in which it would be granted, and would be appropriate.  It may be asked: &ldquo;If the procedure is to first serve a felling notice, and then cut away till you are prohibited, what is the point of the licence?&rdquo; Deputies   may say that it may happen in practice that a felling notice might be served on the forestry branch through the Civic Guard, and that the Department or the official responsible would make up their minds whether they would prohibit it or not; if they did not prohibit, felling would take place, and that therefore there does not seem to be any case for the licence; that you either prohibit or you do nothing.  The point about the licence is that on some occasions the forestry branch might get an application for the felling of a very big number of trees, for an ambitious programme, and the forestry branch would be anxious, perhaps, to investigate the question a little, in order to make sure that a prohibition notice should not be served.  As a rule, when a felling notice is given, in 75 per cent. of the cases nothing will happen, and after three weeks cutting can take place, but there will be applications which are so important that obviously they should be investigated by someone. If there is not time to investigate them within three weeks, the procedure would be to serve a prohibition notice, which is a sort of stay of execution, and gives the Department time to examine the cases a bit further.  If after such further examination it is considered that the application should be allowed, then a licence to fell the trees can be granted.  In connection with Section 34 of the Local Government Board Act of 1925, if a tree is lying across the road obviously a county council should remove it without waiting for any authority, and in the case of Section 98 of the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1927 I suppose the same consideration applies.  The amendment proceeds: 
     ...nor to any tree which is the subject of a contract for the sale thereof made before the 1st day of April, 1928, where particulars of such contract verified in the prescribed manner have been furnished to the Minister within one month from the commencement of this Act and such tree is cut down or uprooted within six months from the commencement of this Act. 
     It is open to argument, as a way of meeting a point made on the Second   Reading by Deputy Moore, that it would be harsh on people who had made contracts prior to this Bill if they were not to be allowed to carry them out.  I have never considered that in practice there would be any difficulty about that.  I believe that the forestry branch of the Department will not interfere in such cases, and, in any event, we have it in black and white that this prohibition will not apply to any contracts made before the 1st of April. 
     
      
       What exactly was implied in the allusion to the Electricity Act: that it was not to apply to trees coming under the Electricity (Supply) Act?  I would like to know the condition under which it comes in. 
     
     
      
       I think for the purpose of putting down poles they have to cut trees and that sort of thing. 
     
     
      
       They can cut any tree without notice for that purpose? 
     
     
      
       That is what it comes to.  The Dail has already given power to the Electricity Supply Board to cut trees that interfere with their operations, and it seems to me inconsistent that another Department would come in and provide licences for that purpose. Here is a case where trees are cut for one specific purpose, which is easily verified.  There does not seem to be anything like the same chance of abuse as where trees are cut by individuals for various purposes.  It seems to me that it would be inconsistent to give power to the Electricity Supply Board to operate and cut trees for any purpose, and to have the Department of Agriculture or its officials coming along asking that that power be modified. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       The only thing that strikes me in connection with Section 4 is that three weeks seems a long time to be held up.  If it were possible to get something in to meet cases of urgency it would seem to be desirable. Government Departments, I suppose, are not always too reliable in answering demands.  I do not want to criticise them in any way, but I suppose it has happened from time to time that   Government Departments have been a bit lax in answering inquiries or in meeting requests of this kind, and I can conceive circumstances where an application would go in that would be very urgent, and where three weeks would be a long time to wait.  Whether it would be practicable to put in something to meet a case of that kind I do not know. 
     
     
      
       That is a matter that we have considered very carefully. Obviously from the business point of view the shorter the time the better. But it is within the knowledge of the Department&mdash;and this is a view with which I agree&mdash;that it would really be impossible to make sure of dealing with every application in a very much shorter time than three weeks.  A very big number of applications will arrive in the beginning, and it will be rather difficult to sort them out, to find out which application should be let through without serving a prohibition notice, and which should not be let through.  I do not believe that it will be possible to do the work within a shorter period than three weeks from the application.  I have consulted certain people in the timber trade whose opinion in the matter I value, and from what they told me, and from whatever little experience I have had myself, I do not think it will make the slightest difference to people who are buying timber on a commercial scale.  After all, when a man is selling a wood it is always two months between the time when he first makes up his mind to sell the wood and the time when he has it sold.  However, that is a matter that Deputies can consider between this and the Report Stage.  I suggest that this would do no hardship, and that it could not be done much shorter. 
     
     
      
       took the Chair. 
     
     
      
       The difficulty I was in was that permission came by default really.  The suggestion apparently is that there should be some means of getting positive information. 
     
     
      
       That is not Deputy Moore's suggestion.  As the amended section stands it means that I serve a felling notice, and unless I hear within   twenty-one days that I am prohibited from cutting a tree I can cut it.  Deputy Moore's suggestion, as I understood it, was that I serve my felling notice, and unless I hear within fourteen or fifteen days that I am prohibited I can go ahead.  My answer to that is that while we will serve prohibition notices in a very small percentage of cases, nevertheless applications must get some examination so as to sift them out and find the, say, two, three or four per cent. of cases in which prohibition notices will be served.  From the business point of view I do not think it will interfere with the commercial sale of the timber, because it always takes two months between the time when a man makes up his mind to sell wood and the time when he sells it. 
     
     
      
       The case I had in mind would be, as often occurs, where a carpenter, say, gets an order to repair a vehicle, or anything of that sort, which is very urgently required.  He may have to arrange to cut down timber to do it.  If he has to send in a notice and remain in suspense for three weeks it would be a great hardship on him, and it might be a hardship on the farmer, or anybody else, who needed the vehicle that was being repaired. That is a case that occurs to me.  The amendment is so new that I do not know if there is very much in it, and I do not want to press the matter at the moment. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I think that disposes of amendments 5, 6 and 7. 
     
     
      
       I think that those amendments ought to be left over until we consider the new Section 5, because Section 5 deals with some of them. 
     
     
      
       The position is that these amendments were put down to the original section. A completely new section has now been inserted, and therefore I think those amendments would fall. 
     
     
      
       Deputies have their rights.  There will be ample time to put in those amendments.  As the Ceann Comhairle explained, Deputies will now see the Bill in its new form,   with the amendments inserted in their proper places, and they will have ample time to see whether it will be necessary to put down any of these amendments again. 
     
     
      
       I do not want to move amendment 6. 
     
     
      
       It was generally understood that the Minister would, when moving his own amendments, explain where there was a slight difference between himself and any of these amendments. 
     
     
      
       That was the reason why I suggested that I should go on to the new Section 5, because that deals with some of the points raised here. 
     
     
      
       Amendment 5 is very important, and I do not think it affects the Minister's amendment very much. 
     
     
      
       Amendments 5, 6, 7 and 8, or at least some of them, are dealt with in subsequent amendments of mine.  They are amendments to a section that is already deleted.  Therefore, it appears to me that they must be withdrawn, of course with an absolute right to the Deputies who have put them down to put them in again, but Deputies will find that it will not be necessary to put in any of them. Take amendment 5: &ldquo;In sub-section (1) (d), line 35, to delete all words after the word &lsquo;building&rsquo; to the end of the paragraph.&rdquo; Sub-Section (1) (d) of Section 4 in the Bill reads: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to cut down or uproot or permit to be cut down or uprooted any tree unless &mdash;such tree is growing or standing within one hundred feet of any building occupied as a dwelling-house or used for housing domestic animals.&rdquo; 
       It is to delete those words, &ldquo;occupied as a dwellinghouse or used for housing domestic animals&rdquo; that Deputy Cole's amendment has been put in.  A subsequent amendment proposes to omit those words.  The Deputy will have plenty of time to verify that between this and the Report Stage. 
     
     
      
       Has the Minister made provision for amendment 8, by Deputy Cole?  I cannot see it. 
     
     
     
      
       That is an amendment that can be debated or put in on the Report Stage.  It is an amendment to a section which has had to be deleted. 
     
     
      
       Would it not expedite matters if the House agreed to the Minister's amendments as they appear on the paper, have the Bill reprinted in the new form, and amended on the Report Stage?  We are only getting confused in trying to deal with amendments that do not now apply at all to the sections to which they were put down. 
     
     
      
       This amendment 8 is a very important one.  Does the Minister say it was dealt with? 
     
     
      
       No, I do not say that. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy can deal with it on the Report Stage. 
     
     
      
       With regard to amendments of this type, which are of considerable importance, and in regard to which no provision has been made in the amendments proposed by the Minister, it seems to me that it is wrong to preclude Deputies from discussing these matters now.  I think it would be better, in dealing with any section, in regard to which any amendments have been put down by a Deputy, and when the Minister has made no provision to meet those amendments, that even those amendments which succeed the Minister's amendment should be discussed before the Minister's amendment, or all the amendments might be discussed together before we accept the Minister's amendment. 
     
     
      
       May I point out that amendment 8 is an amendment to a section which has been deleted, and therefore it cannot be moved. 
     
     
      
       Before the section is amended it might be better, in order that the point of view of Deputies should be discussed at this stage, that it should be in order, so to speak, to discuss subsequent amendments with the Minister's amendment. 
     
     
      
       I think Deputy O'Hanlon's suggestion is the right one.  It is no use discussing those, because we   will be discussing issues which will not arise on the Report Stage.  When Deputies receive the revised form of the Bill they might make up their minds that certain points are covered sufficiently.  Apart from the ruling that these cannot be moved because the section to which they were applicable has been withdrawn, it seems to me a waste of time to discuss amendments which, on consideration, in view of new sections inserted, Deputies would not move on Report.  I think the businesslike thing to do would be to allow me, generally speaking, to move my amendments and explain them, and to accept them, or delete them if you wish, after you have heard the explanation, and when you have them in their place in the Bill, after having had time to consider them. 
     
     
      
       I do not know that there could be any exception to that, provided the Minister agrees to recommit the Bill for any particular section. 
     
     
      
       I agree. 
     
     
      
       This amendment 8 is not in its proper place now in regard to the new amendment, so that I claim the right to move it on Report. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy will get that right. 
       Section 4 agreed to. 
       SECTION 5. 
       (1)  The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, grant to any person a licence in the prescribed form to cut down or uproot any tree specified in such licence. 
       (2)  Every application for a licence under this section shall be in the prescribed form and shall contain the prescribed particulars. 
       (3)  A licence granted under this section shall operate to relieve in respect of every tree mentioned therein the licensee and any person authorised by him from any prohibition against cutting down or uprooting contained in this Act but shall not operate to give any other relief or to confer any further or other authority in respect of any such tree. 
     
     (4)  A licence granted under this section may, if the Minister so thinks   fit, contain a condition that the licensee shall, within a specified time after cutting down or uprooting a tree under the licence, plant one or more trees of a specified kind on the holding on which such tree was cut down or uprooted and if in any such case the licensee fails to perform such condition within the time specified in that behalf in the licence he shall be guilty of an offence under this section in respect of every month during which such failure continues and shall be liable on summary conviction of any such offence to a fine, in the case of a first offence in respect of any particular licence, not exceeding five pounds and, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence in respect of the same licence, not exceeding ten pounds. 
     (5)  Before granting a licence under this section to cut down or uproot a tree on a holding which is for the time being subject to an annuity payable to the Irish Land Commission the Minister shall have regard to the security for the payment of such annuity. 
     
      
       I move amendment 9:&mdash; 
       To insert before Section 5 a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       (1)  Where a felling notice contains a statement that a tree is being cut down or uprooted for a specified purpose, it shall not be lawful for any person to use or deal with such tree or any substantial part thereof or cause or permit the same to be used or dealt with when cut down or uprooted in pursuance of such felling notice for any purpose other than the purpose so stated in such felling notice. 
       (2)  Every person who uses or deals with a tree or any part thereof or causes or permits the same to be used or dealt with in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds for every such tree. 
       That speaks for itself. 
     
     
      
       This will be recommitted again? 
     
     
     
      
       Certainly, it will. 
     
     
      
       It seems to me to be out of place to discuss it now, but in the second line of the amendment it says &ldquo;uprooted for a specified purpose.&rdquo; The primary purpose may not be the purpose of the particular user &mdash;it might be quite a different purpose altogether, to clear the land, for instance. 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy would turn to page 3, sub-section (5), of amendment 10 he will find: &ldquo;For the purposes of this section the following trees shall be deemed to be exempted trees, namely, (a) a tree which is stated in the felling notice to be intended to be uprooted for the purpose of transplantation, (b) a tree standing or growing in a county borough, or urban county district, (c) a tree growing or standing within 100 feet of any building,&rdquo; and so on.  For instance, supposing a felling notice comes up notifying the intention of the owner of certain lands to cut trees because they are falling over the house and it is found afterwards that they are half a mile away from the house, that would be a gross fraud under the Act. When a notification like that comes in, you are not going to send down an inspector in such a case&mdash;you could not be sending down inspectors in cases like that.  You do nothing, and the man cuts straight away.  In such a case you might find afterwards that these trees were half a mile away from the house. 
     
     
      
       The point I want to get at is: &ldquo;uprooted for a specified purpose.&rdquo; Therefore, a person who deals in these trees would want to know the purpose. 
     
     
      
       &ldquo;To use or deal with such tree&rdquo;&mdash;that is not referring to a dealer in trees, but to the man who gets leave to cut a tree for a specified purpose. For instance, it was pressed on Second Reading that people should have the right to cut trees for fuel under certain conditions.  Trees are cut on that understanding and we find afterwards that they are cut entirely for sale.  That should be made an offence. The position would be: You want to cut trees for fuel; you serve a notice   and cut away after a certain lapse of time.  There is no inspection of any kind.  The only check is that we may get information afterwards from the Garda that they have been cut down and sold while the man said he wanted them for fuel.  In view of the fact that, for administrative purposes, we may have no control over the cutting of trees, except the user of them afterwards, and as we are giving such wide exemptions, the least we ought to be in a position to do is to prosecute a man, who is not stopped from cutting trees, because he has sent in his notification form that he wanted the trees for a specific purpose, but afterwards uses the timber for a different purpose&mdash;a purpose for which he would not be allowed to cut it. 
     
     
      
       I think the difficulty is that when you cut down a tree, say, for the purpose of making planks to build a cow-house, a certain portion of that tree is not of any value for that purpose and might reasonably be used as fuel.  I agree with the Minister that this section is necessary to prevent the abuse of the latitude given under the previous amendments, but it can be met by people, when they put in an application to cut a tree, saying the tree is to be cut for planks and fuel.  That will get over it.  Certainly there is always, when you cut through the branches and tops, a certain amount not of any use for commercial purposes. I believe the Minister might make that a little clearer, either by some amendment on the Report Stage or in the Orders to be issued, because there are always little bits of a tree left over that you want to use in some other way.  I agree with the main point of the Minister, that it should not be allowed to be cut for fuel and then sold, but perhaps the section might be extended, or the Orders to be issued under the previous amendments might show clearly all the purposes for which the tree is to be used. 
     
     
      
       This section is likely to be misunderstood by persons dealing with it, such as the Garda, who could make it very annoying if this was literally interpreted and given full force.  There might be three feet of a   tree useful for a commercial purpose and it would be a pity to use it for firewood.  I can visualise three or four feet of a certain class of tree being useful in that way and no other parts of the tree being fit for anything except firewood.  Such a part of a tree might be worth 10/- or £1 and it might be made an offence for it to be utilised in that way.  It is a common thing to get only three or four feet of useful timber out of a whole tree.  The main purpose might be to use that tree for firewood, and it might be made an offence to use that particular portion in this way.  It is a section which could be abused, except its terms are drawn very tight, and the whole thing will depend on those administering it. 
     
     
      
       When hedge timber and that sort of thing has to be cut down there is no necessity for setting out lots of details.  There will be a form filled to the effect that two or three trees are to be cut down and that it is hedge timber, and there will be no more about it.  It is only in rare cases that you fill in what you want to do with the timber.  Deputy Gorey made the point that certain trees might be wanted for firewood.  There is a tree felled for firewood and some of it is sold, and an inspector comes down and says you should not have sold any part of this particular tree; you have got leave to fell for firewood.  But look at the other side of the question.  An application is made to fell a tree for firewood, and then it is found that only the tops of the branches are lopped off and the rest is sold.  Would that not make hay of the whole Act?  You must leave something to administration. 
     
     Deputy Gorey sees the difficulty from one point of view.  He points out that there might be what would make a nice hub of a wheel in a beech tree, although the tree was cut down for firewood, and that the Civic Guard would prosecute a man because he sold that piece of wood.  That never would occur in any circumstances.  I will tell you what could occur if the section was drafted differently.  Suppose a man wants to sell a tree that he should not sell, or should not cut down for sale, or wants to use it for some purpose   that it should not be used for, he simply gets a licence, cuts off the tops and some of the branches and then sells the rest.  There are extremes on both sides. 
     
      
       It will have to be left to discretion. 
     
     
      
       That is the trouble, I agree. 
     
     
      
       May I ask the Minister what is the meaning of these words: &ldquo;Every person who permits the same to be used or dealt with in contravention of this section&rdquo;?  Would that apply to sawmillers or to other persons engaged in wood-working industries? 
     
     
      
       What is the Deputy reading from? 
     
     
      
       &ldquo;Every person who uses or deals with a tree or any part thereof or causes or permits the same to be used or dealt with in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds for every such tree.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       That is sub-section (2) of Section 9. 
     
     
      
       That is common form; it means guilty knowledge and malice aforethought.  It implies guilty knowledge and conspiracy. 
     
     
      
       A famous statesman said recently: &ldquo;My knowledge of the law is not worth twopence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Of some law. 
     
     
      
       I was only concerned whether that word &ldquo;permits&rdquo; may not mean that somebody connected with the wood-working industry would have to see the permit to know the reason why it was granted. 
     
     
      
       No.  It really means that the person prosecuting would have to prove conspiracy and guilty knowledge, which is common form.  You will find cases where a man was induced to fraudulently cut by a merchant.  Why should he not be brought up in such a case?  But that would have to be proved up to the hilt. 
     
     
     
      
       The Minister has raised rather a fearful prospect about a man asking permission to cut down trees on the grounds that there was danger that they were going to fall upon his house. He took an unfavourable example and supposed that the trees were half a mile away, but let us take a favourable case where a man wanted to cut down a tree which was only five feet away and where there was real danger in the thing.  Is he to wait for three weeks?  I want to get that clear from the Minister. 
     
     
      
       There is a point in that. 
     
     
      
       Tie a string around it. 
     
     
      
       We are law-abiding and we want to know. 
     
     
      
       Again let us take that with regard to trees that come within the category of amendment 10.  There is no permit required in regard to these; therefore the point does not arise. 
     
     
      
       Here is what happens if the Deputy will read amendment No. 10, sub-section (1): &ldquo;Whenever a felling notice has been given in respect of any tree the Minister may, unless such tree is an exempted tree within the meaning of this section, within, but not after twenty-one days&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Now the point is: Is that for all trees&mdash;good, bad or indifferent, exempt or not?  A felling notice must be served, and for all trees except the exempted trees, the applicant must wait for twenty-one days before he can cut, but with regard to the exempted trees he can serve a notice to-day and cut to-morrow. The only advantage is that there has been a notification in such cases as I have mentioned.  A tree is falling on a house; the man issues notice to the nearest police barrack and cuts it.  It may be found afterwards that it was a dodge.  If Deputies will withdraw their amendments to the sections deleted and allow me to go on with the new sections a lot of this discussion will disappear. 
       Amendment 9 agreed to. 
       New section ordered to be inserted. 
     
     
     
      
       I beg to move amendment 10: 
       To insert before Section 5 a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       (1)  Whenever a felling notice has been given in respect of any tree the Minister may, unless such tree is an exempted tree within the meaning of this section, within but not after twenty-one days from the date on which such notice was so given, make and serve on the owner by or on whose behalf such notice was given or his successor in title an order (in this section referred to as a prohibition order) in the prescribed form prohibiting the cutting down or uprooting of such tree. 
       (2)  Every prohibition order shall be served either by delivering the same to the person on whom it is to be served or by leaving it for him with a person of the age of sixteen years or upwards at the place named in the said felling notice for the service of documents under this Act. 
       (3)  Where a prohibition order has been made in respect of any tree and has been duly served in accordance with this section, it shall not be lawful for any person to cut down or uproot or cause or permit to be cut down or uprooted such tree unless at the time such tree is cut down or uprooted or caused or permitted to be cut down or uprooted a licence has been granted by the Minister under this Act in respect of such tree. 
       (4)  If any person cuts down or uproots or causes or permits to be cut down or uprooted any tree in contravention of this section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds for every tree so cut down or uprooted or caused or permitted to be cut down or uprooted. 
       (5)  For the purposes of this section the following trees shall be deemed to be exempted trees, namely&mdash; 
       (a)  a tree which is stated in the felling notice to be intended to be uprooted for the purpose of transplantation. 
     
     (b)  a tree growing or standing in   a county borough or urban county district, 
     (c)  a tree growing or standing within one hundred feet of any building, 
     (d)  a tree which is not necessary for the ornament or protection of the holding on which it stands and is stated in the felling notice to be intended to be cut down for the purpose of using the timber thereof for the construction or repair of buildings, fences or other structures on the said holding or another holding belonging to the owner of such first-mentioned holding, or on a holding belonging to another person in the immediate neighbourhood of such first-mentioned holding, 
     (e)  a tree which is stated in the felling notice to be intended to be cut down for the purpose of using it as domestic fuel on the holding on which it stands, 
     (f)  a tree which is dead or decayed or irremediably damaged and useless for commercial purposes, 
     (g)  a tree in respect of which it is stated in the felling notice that such tree is standing on land purchased before the 1st day of April, 1928, and that the whole or some part of the purchase-money of such land was lent to the purchaser thereof on the terms that such tree should be cut down and sold and the proceeds thereof applied in or towards repayment of such loan and that such loan or some part thereof is still owing at the date of such felling notice and that such tree is being cut down for the purpose of complying with the said terms of the said loan. 
     I hope Deputies are clear on the procedure: a felling notice must be served in the case of the cutting of every tree. 
     
      
       In the case of every tree? 
     
     
      
       Yes, or in the case of every group of trees.  One notice would cover hundreds of trees.  The Department, of course, may interfere, but they must interfere within twenty-one   days, and if they do not the man can cut away.  Then, with regard to what is called exempted trees notice must be served, but the felling may take place immediately.  There must be notification, but there is the advantage that a man can act quickly and immediately and do what he likes, but he must come within the terms of the Act of Parliament. If he serves notice to the effect that there is a fine beech tree falling over his house, if it was found afterwards that that tree was half a mile away he can be prosecuted.  In other words, he can be prevented from abusing the actual licence itself. 
       The new section, as it stands, deals with at least four points.  It enables a man to cut trees for firewood; it enables an owner to give a neighbour power to cut trees for various purposes on his own land.  It also covers a point analogous to the point made by Deputy Moore, because where money was advanced on a mortgage before the passing of this Act the security, of course, was the woods on the land.  The whole of the money would not have been advanced but for the fact that there was valuable timber on the land.  That must be just as much safeguarded as in any case where a contract had been entered into for the sale of timber.  There are one or two exceptions.  In all cases, with the exception of exempted trees, a felling notice must be served.  An owner may proceed to cut trees after the twenty-one days' notice has been given unless he is prohibited by the Department.  The exempted trees are the trees which I have just read out: a tree which is being uprooted for transplantation, a tree required for building, a tree growing in an urban district, a tree to be used for firewood, or a tree which is dead or decayed or irremediably damaged and useless for commercial purposes. 
       That is the effect of the new section. In my opinion, that is a much simpler and a much more satisfactory arrangement from the point of view of the owners of the trees at least than the arrangement that was proposed under the Bill when it was introduced.  Under Sections 4 and 5, as the Bill originally stood, it was necessary to get a positive permit in all cases of the cutting of trees. 
     
     
     
      
       I think that most of the Minister's amendment is extremely good.  There is one point, however, on which I differ from him.  I do not think it is a good thing to compel a notice to be given in every case as regards exempted trees.  If a notice has to be given in every case, it will cause great inconvenience and danger, I fear, occasionally.  Take a case where, for instance, a tree was falling on one's house.  If you had to give notice before you took down the tree, it might come down on the house before you had got the permission to take it down.  The same would apply in cases where there was a danger of trees falling on glass-houses in gardens.  The damage might have been done before permission was obtained to get the exempted tree down. 
     
     
      
       In that class of case, you do not want an exemption at all. You can serve a notice on the nearest police barrack and cut away. 
     
     
      
       But, if the law is there, you must give notice.  It might turn out to be a very serious matter for an owner if he were to take a tree down without getting the required permission, or, in the cases that I have referred to, serious damage might have been done before the permission was obtained. 
     
     
      
       You have the right to cut.  No one can prevent you from cutting. All you are asked to do is to send a boy to the nearest police barrack with the notice. 
     
     
      
       I do not like the way this is left.  Something might turn up to prevent a man sending a notice to the nearest police barrack. 
     
     
      
       There is one matter that I wish to refer to.  There is an Act of Parliament dealing with it, but unfortunately I have not got a copy of the statute with me.  Speaking from recollection, and I think the Minister will agree with me on this, I know that under that particular statute there are at the present time very wide powers vested in either county councils or in county surveyors with regard to the removal of trees or interference with trees. 
     
     
     
      
       I am aware of that. 
     
     
      
       I take it that, in this Bill, the Minister has been careful to preserve these powers. 
     
     
      
       If the Deputy turns to sub-section (5) of the proposed new Section 4, he will see that it is provided that this section shall not apply to any tree, the cutting down of which is authorised under Section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925, or Section 98 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927. 
     
     
      
       I think the power conferred on local authorities was given much earlier than that referred to in either of the two Acts referred to by the Minister.  I think that they have power of their motion, without reference to any Department, to cut down trees. 
     
     
      
       I think that under the Local Government Act of 1925 (No. 5 of 1925) the powers which local authorities had under the previous Acts have been all repealed, and that they are all now amalgamated in the one section.  However, the matter is one that I will look into. 
     
     
      
       This new section is a great improvement on the Bill as introduced.  I would like to hear the Minister's views as to whether it might not be possible to take out of the Bill the necessity of giving notice with regard to exempted trees.  I do not put forward that suggestion very definitely, because there may be very good reasons why this matter of giving notice should be maintained.  I can see, however, that in practice there may be a great deal of difficulty in having the section, as amended, carried out.  The amendment will enable farmers to cut down certain exempted trees subject to giving notice.  The exempted trees fall into certain categories. One refers to trees required for firewood, another to trees required for repairing fences, and so on.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware that it is a common practice, particularly on large farms, to fell small trees which probably would come within the definition of trees, but which would be much closer to the definition of shrubs.  The   trees used for the repairing of fences are usually very immature trees.  If notice has to be served in cases of this kind, it will mean that farmers will be considerably hampered in their operations because of the necessity of having to send notices continuously to the Civic Guard.  It would also have the effect of, so to speak, swamping the Forestry Department with these notices.  I suggest to the Minister the desirability of considering whether it might not be possible for him to abolish the necessity for having notices served in regard to exempted trees. 
     
     
      
       There was general agreement here&mdash;at least if you take what people say&mdash;that it is necessary to control in some way the cutting of trees.  That is number one.  Number two is, there is general agreement that it is exceedingly difficult to do it.  In that state of affairs I suppose the proper thing to do is to investigate and see for what purpose trees should be freely cut without permission from anybody.  I have incorporated in this exemption section, with one or two exceptions, the suggestions made in the Second Reading.  Deputy Heffernan's suggestion is that that does not go far enough.  I ask that notification should be given to the Civic Guards that trees are being cut for these purposes.  I make no claim as to preventing them cutting such trees, but I say in the section that if they cut freely, when how, and where they like for these purposes there should be some method of seeing that when you give so much latitude, almost complete and absolute, for cutting these trees there should be some method of checking that the trees have been cut for the purposes specified.  If there is to be no notification you might as well take the section out of the Bill.  If you take out those exemptions, and if you allow trees to be cut freely without notification for all these purposes, the section might as well be removed. 
     
     As I have said, I do not mind making exemptions as wide as possible. I do not believe you can administer this Act by filling the country with inspectors who go around with a microscope examining trees and filling up forms.  The only way you could   administer the Act successfully would be to leave it wide and interfere as little as possible, but to make it clear that certain things were offences, and when an offence is committed be in a position to come down heavily on the person who committed it.  I suggest to Deputy Heffernan, in view of the comprehensiveness of these exemptions, and in view of the fact that people may cut trees for these purposes without any permit, the least that may be expected of them is that they should notify, and afterwards we would be able to find out if there were any glaring case where a man cut valuable timber, such as copper beeches, and was selling it.  If in such cases he had filled in a notification that he wanted trees for firewood he could be come down upon heavily. 
     
      
       Will the Minister say if the exemption would include small holdings where it might be necessary to cut trees for poles? 
     
     
      
       The Deputy will perhaps wait for another section to meet that.  If it was required to cut down a tree for the purpose of transplanting, a man should be able to do that without getting any leave from the Department. Let him just send in his notice and do it.  The Deputy has in mind a case where a man is doing certain forestry operations in his own land.  That is covered by amendment 16. 
     
     
      
       I have not referred to the cutting of trees for the purpose of transplanting. 
     
     
      
       I would like to ask if the Minister has provided in the Bill that no prosecution should be brought save with his consent, coupling with it the useful addendum, so often used, that his consent shall prove itself without sending down any official or witness. 
     
     
      
       That is the position under the Bill. 
     
     
      
       I notice that the Minister very properly protects the rights of those who have bought timber before the 1st April.  I mentioned on the Second Reading a rather peculiar case, though it would not be altogether isolated, where a person had bought fee   simple land with timber.  Would that cover his right if he bought the land with timber on it, to use the timber for a specific purpose, say in a factory of his own? 
     
     
      
       I would say it would. If it could be proved that a man bought a fee simple wood for the purpose of cutting down the trees, that is a contract for the cutting down of the trees. 
     
     
      
       I suggest we ought to let these amendments go, and we can discuss them when we come to the recommittal stage, as there is no use in discussing them now and again later on. 
       Amendment 10 put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       To delete sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) and substitute one new sub-section, as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(1)  Whenever a prohibition order has been made and served under this Act in relation to a tree the Minister may at any time after the making of such order grant to the owner of such tree a licence in the prescribed form to cut down or uproot such tree and such licence shall operate to relieve in respect of such tree the licensee and any person authorised by him from the prohibition effected by the said prohibition order.&rdquo; 
       As I explained before, occasionally the Department may get a felling notice which appears on the face of it to require a certain consideration, which it could not get within three weeks.  A prohibition notice would give them time to look further into such a case, and afterwards they could cancel the prohibition by licence. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       To insert before sub section (2) two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash; 
     
     (2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing sub-section it shall be lawful for any person engaged at the date of the passing of this Act in the Saorstat in any branch of the wood-working industries to purchase and fell trees without licence for the purpose   of his industry subject to such regulations as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister.  Any person claiming to be included under this sub-section shall make application to the Minister within one month after the passing of this Act who shall have power to decide as to the bona-fides of every applicant. 
     (3)  The Minister shall cause a register to be kept of every person exempted from the operation of this section by the foregoing sub-section and there shall be entered in such register the full name and address of the person and such description of the situation of the place of business of such person as is necessary to identify the same. 
     The purpose of the amendment is to protect certain industries.  I do not think the Minister would hold that an industry is in a stable condition, or can feel the necessary confidence, if the raw material which it requires will not be available for it.  In the Bill there is no security that the raw material will be available.  Furniture factories, coach-building factories, sawmillers, and various other industries will have to get the Minister's permission before they can cut any timber for their industry. Of course most Deputies will believe, as I do, that ordinarily there will be no difficulty in getting that permission. I think no Government would in ordinary circumstances be foolish enough to refuse it, but at the same time the whole purpose in putting in that prohibition is in order that it may be exercised at some time or other.  I consider in such important legislation we should not, even theoretically, leave any industry in the position that wood-working industries would be in if this Bill goes through.  We all know there is not much public opinion at present, and that the Government, not merely in this but in most countries, can at present do things that if there was any well-developed public opinion or normal mental activity amongst the people they would not be allowed to do.  In this case I can easily see there would be opportunity for the present or some future Government to use the powers under this Bill to make things very uncomfortable   for people engaged in certain industries.  I hope the Government will realise it is not for the period of the present Government this Bill is being passed, but for the period of different Governments, and we may have a lot of Governments in the next few years.  To leave power like that in the hands of the Minister, or any Government Department, is inviting tyranny and accepting a principle that is one of the most fiercely contested there is at present.  If we all believed that Government officials could do no wrong, that they could show no bias and all that, I suppose we might be in favour of a very different principle of industrial control to what prevails. 
     Certainly the arguments of those who oppose socialism would have lost their chief value.  In giving the Government this power we are certainly admitting a principle that has not been accepted up to the present, namely, that State officials will in all circumstances act strictly fairly, that they will not have any regard to personalities, and will only consider the good of the country as a whole.  I hold, just as the Minister has admitted, that in certain circumstances these licences should not be required.  In the circumstances relating to these industries the case is much stronger than any other that could be brought forward.  Several of the wood-working industries are the most promising industries at present.  We are told that the tariff on furniture is a great success, and that the production of furniture in this country is increasing. The Government has, I believe, given a State loan to one furniture factory. It is hoped that the coach-building industry will develop from its present depressed state into being more active.  There is, however, no security for capital, and there can be no confidence on the part of those engaged in such industries if raw material is not to be made available except through the good-will of the Government. The Minister should, I think, accept the amendment. 
     
      
       Deputy Moore, in speaking very moderately on this amendment, said that its purpose was   to protect industry.  What industry? The industry of the person who grows timber or the person who cuts it down?  The only industry to which the Deputy referred was that of the person who cuts timber and runs a sawmill.  There are, perhaps, about two hundred and fifty such persons in this State, and, while practically every tenant farmer or person who has land of his own is a grower of timber, Deputy Moore invites us to act in the interests of two hundred and fifty persons.  I, for one, own a sawmill, but I am not in agreement with the amendment.  Though I own a sawmill I have not been consulted on this amendment, and there are many others like me who are not in agreement with it. 
     
     
      
       I am not putting forward the amendment in the interests of sawmillers. 
     
     
      
       I, of course, accept that.  Deputy Moore is well aware of the fact that we all have amendments submitted to us, and I know that he would not put forward an amendment in which he did not believe. 
     
     
      
       I have not been influenced by any representations made to me. 
     
     
      
       This is Deputy Moore's own proposal? 
     
     
      
       No; I did not even say that. 
     
     
      
       Is Deputy Moore really putting forward the amendment? I take it that it is his proposal.  He proposes, in the first place, to create a monopoly.  The only people who will have any powers under the proposed section are those engaged at the date of the passing of the Act in any branch of the wood-working industry.  That is a complete monopoly for any person who has at the passing of the Act a sawmill, and anyone who comes later can claim no right.  Even if the most respectable people in the world, say, Deputy Flinn, Deputy Fahy and Deputy Lemass, proposed to start a wood-working industry six months hence, they will have to go to the Minister and get a licence for all the timber which they propose to cut.  The amendment   gives a monopoly to existing sawmillers. I am an existing sawmiller and I have not suggested to Deputy Moore to move such an amendment.  Deputy Moore talked about the Bill inviting tyranny, but is there a greater tryanny than that of monopoly?  If this amendment were adopted how would it work?  It would mean that the existing sawmillers who came under the section could go anywhere in the Saorstat and buy any timber they liked, at practically any price they liked, without any check or control of any kind whatever.  They could denude the hills on the side of Glendalough as the hills on the road to Glendalough have been denuded.  The Minister could not say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Nobody could say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; except in so far as Deputy Moore has inserted the expression: &ldquo;Subject to such regulations as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo; 
     
     I am not a lawyer and I do not like to lay down the law, but I do not think that the Minister could prescribe regulations which could nullify this amendment if it became part of the Act.  I think it could be voided in common law if people were checked from exercising any rights given them under the Act. The existing timber merchant is to be supreme.  Deputy Moore in an amendment that is going to be ruled out of order wants to check him from any competition on the Border, to check him selling timber in its rough state to anybody outside the Saorstat.  A small number of Saorstat timber merchants are to have the whole control.  Deputy Moore talks about well-developed public opinion, but if there is well-developed public opinion in this State it would not stand for the setting up of a monopoly on the part of a small ring.  Deputy Moore said that there is an assumption that Government officials can do no wrong. They can.  They can make mistakes and they admit, so far as I have come in contact with them, that they can make mistakes.  At any rate they have no personal ends to serve.  Deputy Moore is going to put control as to what timber is to be cut on existing sawmillers. Is it possible that they with personal interests to serve and profits to earn can do no wrong?  I would prefer   in the general interests, in those of the grower as well as those of the merchant, as well as those who want to beautify our hills and preserve the charm of our countryside, to have a Government official as a referee than an interested sawmiller.  I hope the Minister will not accept the amendment, but if he does I would almost be inclined to divide the Dail upon it against him, as it would be fatal to the interests of the timber growers, which are of greater concern than those of the merchants. 
     
      
       Deputy Cooper has made what I might call an impassioned speech against the amendment. I think his grievance against the amendment only came in as an aside towards the end of his speech when he referred to a subsequent amendment which Deputy Moore has on the Order Paper.  That is with regard to export.  This amendment must be taken more or less in conjunction with the other amendment with regard to export in order to have full effect.  I do not know if the Deputy's big objection to this amendment lies against the free export or the free import of timber so much as his objection lies against the free export and the free import of other articles to this country.  Another thing that has to be taken into account is that this was an amendment to the original Bill.  Deputy Moore can speak for himself, but personally I do not know if he would have been as strong in this amendment if he saw certain provisions here where the onus is put on the Department of Agriculture to say &ldquo;you must not cut a tree,&rdquo; whereas under the original Bill the onus was on the timber merchant to get a permit, which is quite a different thing. 
     
     The Bill is entirely altered, but even so I think a very good case can be made for an amendment to give the timber merchant power within certain regulations.  The regulations are, of course, a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, but within those regulations the timber merchant.  I think, cannot be expected to do his business properly or efficiently unless he has some idea that he is going to get, or   has a reasonable chance of getting, a permit under certain circumstances. That really appears to be the gist of the amendment&mdash;to give to a timber merchant an idea of what the regulations are which he has to fulfil in order that he may be more or less certain that he will get a permit to cut certain wood. 
     
      
       It seems to me that if Deputy Moore's amendment is accepted the effect of it will be to vitiate the whole intention of the Bill, because, after all, what is the intention of the Bill but to encourage afforestation and the planting of trees in this country and to regulate the cutting down or destruction of trees in accordance with the requirements of the country?  Control in that case can only be exercised by people who are not personally interested, people who have expert knowledge.  For that reason naturally the control in regard to the felling of trees is placed in the hands of the Department, which is in a position to know whether it is advisable in the interests of the country, of a particular industry, or in the interests of growers to give permission to cut down particular trees.  It seems to me that Deputy Moore in moving the amendment is actuated by what I might describe as an obsession which some persons have for industrial protection and in the desire to help industrialists as opposed to agriculturists.  They are even prepared to place in the control of certain people, wood-workers, complete control of afforestation in Ireland. The effect of the amendment would be that anybody styled a wood-worker would have the right to enter any forest in Ireland and to take therefrom the most suitable trees for his purpose.  It seems to me that that would be creating an intolerable state of affairs.  It would place the control of all afforestation work in Ireland in the hands of a body defined as wood-workers. To start with, what is the definition of a wood-worker?  Possibly Deputy Moore has a rather restricted idea in his mind of what a wood-worker is, but in fact a wood-worker would have to be regarded as a person who performed any industrial operation on a tree.  A simple operation on timber   might place him within the category of a wood-worker.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that it is inadvisable to accept this amendment, if for no other reason than that it is creating a class privilege.  It would be creating a class privilege to the advantage of the person who is least entitled to it.  The person who is not the owner of the tree is going to get special powers which the owner of the land, who grows the trees, does not possess.  The farmer who is the owner of the land, and part of whose occupation is the planting of trees, has to apply for a special permit before he cuts down a tree even for his own purposes, whereas a particular individual, defined as a wood-worker, has only to comply with certain regulations and he can walk in and cut down as many trees as he wishes.  I think that would have the result of vitiating the whole intention of the Bill. 
     
     
      
       In my judgment both Deputy Cooper and Deputy Heffernan have taken too narrow a view on this amendment.  I do not think they can have read the words as they appear in the amendment to see how far they would carry us.  I think we should translate them in a far broader way, the view with which they must be translated if they become part of an Act, and as they might be construed in favour of a defendant.  The amendment, as I read it, suggests that any person engaged in the wood-working industry is exempt from the Act. Put into simple language, that is what it means.  Deputy Cooper suggests that he is concerned in the saw-milling industry. So am I.  I do not think we need go that far to become exempt from the Act if this amendment is passed.  I spend some of my spare time in chopping firewood and the moment I do that I am engaged in woodwork. When this amendment becomes law I am exempt from any venom the Minister for Agriculture can pour upon me, so that there is a great deal to be said in favour of the amendment.  Since the amendment was proposed I have been engaged in the woodworking industry. I have been engaged in sharpening a pencil.  Surely I have been engaged in woodwork while I was doing that. That is the section which it is solemnly   proposed should be added to the Bill, leaving it to the justices and judges all over the world to discover what is woodwork and what is not.  I suppose it means working in wood&mdash;anybody who occupies himself for half an hour in chopping up firewood or sharpening a pencil.  It is putting too narrow an interpretation on it to say, as Deputy Cooper suggested, that you must be the owner or the part-owner of a sawmill. Anybody who sharpens a pencil is a woodworker and is exempt from the Act. 
     
     
      
       I think if this amendment is accepted it will destroy the Bill entirely.  The object of the Bill is to preserve the trees of the country.  This amendment would give to one class of people in the country what none of the others have.  That is, without any licence they can make an arrangement with somebody who wants to sell trees, irrespective of whatever damage it may do to his own place or to the neighbourhood.  Without any licence this can be carried out to the detriment of the community.  I think it is a bad principle to give to anybody a monopoly in a thing so important as this, the cutting down of trees.  To my mind this amendment would vitiate the whole Bill.  I am quite certain that the sawmillers will not be interfered with in any unreasonable way.  They have only to ask, as everybody else has to ask, for a licence to cut down trees and there is no reason why the Minister would refuse to grant it.  It can be assumed that the Minister would be a reasonable man now and in the future.  He has nothing more to do than the owner of ornamental trees; he has to make his application for permission to cut them down.  No case has been made out for this special exemption, but I think a very strong case is made out that a monopoly should not be set up. That, to my mind, would be one of the greatest detriments. 
     
     
      
       Apart from the question of monopoly, I think that the acceptance of Deputy Moore's amendment would mean the nullification of the Bill altogether.  There are certain trees which the farmers can cut down. They are exempt, but if they have to   give notice in regard to the cutting down of trees as suggested in the amendment, it will mean that all they have to do is to get someone in the saw-milling industry to take over the trees. I think in fairness to everybody the amendment ought to be withdrawn because it is a nullification of the whole measure. 
     
     
      
       That is the point. What would happen if one is refused a permit is that one would go to a sawmiller and sell.  It would be extremely pleasant for the sawmiller, who would realise that his market is protected, and for the man with the timber, who would realise that there is someone to whom he could sell.  Perhaps Deputy Moore will say that we could alter the wording of the amendment.  As the amendment stands it will simply make bits of the Bill.  Anybody who is refused a licence would go to the sawmiller and he would buy.  Let us take, not so much the wording as the meaning of the amendment. 
     
     I agree with Deputy Wolfe that, as the amendment is drafted, it means that anybody who cuts wood is a wood-worker. The amendment, taken in conjunction with amendment 18, really means what Deputy Cooper says.  There is a distinction between those who cut timber and those who export timber. The Deputy referred to timber merchants and their position, and this, I take it, is put forward from Deputy Moore's point of view as doing the fair thing by the timber merchants.  This amendment is no good to them.  It only raises false hopes.  The normal operations of the timber merchants are not going to be interfered with, and they know that pretty well.  I refer Deputies again to the sub-section.  The intention is to cover any person owning a sawmill at the date of the passing of the Act.  What is hoped for under this section as it stands is that it will give the existing sawmillers a right to cut timber when and where they like.  It is hoped if new sawmillers come in that they will not get any licence, and the result is that the existing sawmillers would have a monopoly.  If that were passed and I had anything to do with the Act, I   would give a licence to every sawmiller. It is not the business of the Minister to create a monopoly for any section of the community.  While I would regard it as a first-class misfortune that this section, as introduced, would be passed, and that any class in the country, or any individuals who are in a certain position by accident&mdash; by the chance that they are in the business at the moment&mdash;should get a monopoly, at the same time it is not my business to discriminate between certain individuals who are pursuing the same sort of a vocation. 
     If the Dail thinks well to give a right to cut trees freely to sawmillers, it would be absolutely absurd of the Minister, whoever he might be, to say that one sawmiller should have that monopoly, which will put good money into his pocket, and the other sawmiller would not.  Anyone with a sense of business or equity would give a licence to every sawmiller to cut trees, present or future.  You could not justify any other procedure.  When people get a monopoly they are bound to take advantage of it.  The Native Timber Merchants' Association may contain the most unimpeachable business men in world, but if they are going to get this monopoly they will take advantage of it.  There is no altruism behind this matter; there are good, sound business reasons.  I quite understand that and I appreciate it.  They would be foolish if they did not take advantage of a monopoly.  They will not get the monopoly, because it would be the gravest injustice for the Minister to give it to them.  The Minister would give a licence to every person and every timber merchant to cut trees wherever they liked. 
     Now, as regards the second part, what is hoped under amendment 18 is, that having given a monopoly to the existing sawmillers in the way of getting the raw materials, in the way of purchasing raw materials, nobody else would be allowed to export timber. All the timber would have to be sawn and exported in that way.  I rule out the timber merchants, and the producer would then be in the position&mdash; that is, the farmer, the landowner, whether he owns in fee or as a tenant &mdash;that he would be growing trees and   he would have to sell those trees to one class.  I have too much respect for the Native Timber Merchants' Association not to realise that they would at once from a ring.  They would at once know who had the right to do business.  They could be all circularised and they would not be so foolish as to do otherwise.  I would lose all respect for them if they were.  They would get into a room and decide what price they would ask for the timber. I believe they would be thinking of this particular matter and not the producer, and I believe that the producer would be getting a lower price.  Nobody could export timber in the round. It would have to be exported sawn. 
     
      
       That amendment has been ruled out of order. 
     
     
      
       If the Minister will allow me, I would like to point out that my amendment stated &ldquo;homegrown hardwoods unless in a manufactured state.&rdquo; Sawn timber is not timber in a manufactured state. 
     
     
      
       Anyway, that amendment is ruled out. 
     
     
      
       Is the Minister referring to amendment 18? 
     
     
      
       Yes.  Now let me say this: that there may be an absolutely good case for interfering in the timber industry at the moment.  It is a protected industry as it is.  It is protected at the expense of the consumer.  The proposal here is to protect it at the expense of the producer as well.  For all I know, a very good case may be made for doing that.  But this is a Forestry Bill, and this amendment brings in an industrial question which raises all sorts of commercial reactions, reactions on the producer and reactions on the consumer, as well as on the sawyer and woodworker, and reaction on labour. This is essentially a question which should be examined as a commercial one, and it has no place in a Forestry Bill.  There is no machinery in the Department of Agriculture to administer any such section.  The Forestry Branch of the Department of Agriculture is unqualified to take any such thing into account.  As I said already, this is a   commercial question, and if anybody has any application to make in connection with the woodwork industry there is a way to make it, and let it be made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is for his Department to examine such an application and to examine it fully as a commercial proposition. It certainly is not the function of a Forestry Bill to do something like this, and it is not in the interests of forestry at all.  The proposal may be quite right in itself&mdash;I do not think it is&mdash;but it is purely a commercial question, and it should be examined only as a commercial question.  I do not care what your views are on protection or subsidies, but surely it must be admitted that a commercial question like this should be examined as such, and I want again to point out that there is no machinery in the Forestry Branch to examine it, and it was never intended that there should.  Before this section is introduced these things should be taken into account, and if it is to be introduced at all it should be introduced in some Bill other than a Forestry Bill. 
     
     
      
       It is apparent that this amendment is very unpopular. Some of the arguments used against it were certainly most extraordinary. For instance, Deputy Cooper, in protesting against the amendment, protested against it on the grounds that it was giving a monopoly to certain people, and that it meant that the woods of the country would be denuded by the timber merchants.  Then the Deputy went on to protest against the proposal to prohibit exports of timber.  I do not see how he can reconcile these things.  If he is in favour of free exports, then the denudation does not matter much to Deputy Cooper.  Another remarkable thing in the debate was to see how many of the big farmers and estate owners were talking about a monopoly.  I think that some fine day they will discover that that argument can be used against themselves in the other industry in which they are more directly concerned. I think a Deputy who himself has control and absolute control of hundreds of acres of land should hesitate before protesting against the   monopoly that this amendment is to give certain people who have capital invested in the country and who are drawing raw material for their industry within the country, to give them a right to purchase that material without any permission from the Government which is what the amendment proposes to do. 
       I do not think it would be held that such people would be likely, willingly, to go out and destroy the raw material of their industry.  That is not the thing one would expect from people who are engaged in the woodwork industry&mdash;that they would go out and destroy the raw material of their own industry.  It would be about as reasonable as to expect that the farmer would go out and destroy or poison his own land.  Certainly some of the arguments that were used were anything but convincing.  Nobody dealt with the chief thing which underlies this amendment.  What underlies this amendment is not regard for the sawmillers or for furniture people or anything else.  It is simply this&mdash;to give confidence to people who are in industry. Everybody realises that it has been the favourite argument used from the Government Benches, that those investing in industry here need encouragement and a certain amount of security&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       Invested or investing? 
     
     
      
       I do not understand the Deputy. 
     
     
      
       I think the Deputy's whole argument, according to the terms of his amendment is that he means to prevent anybody from further investing. 
     
     
      
       I do not think so at all.  It may interest Deputy Gorey to know that this amendment, coupled with the amendment against the export of timber, militates against the interests of the sawmillers, because the sawmillers might easily get a much better price for their produce if exported, whereas under the proposed prohibition on exports the timber could only be exported in a manufactured state. 
     
     Nobody has dealt with the fact that   under this there will be no security that the raw material that these factories are using, or are likely to use, will be available except at the discretion of a particular Minister or a Government Department.  It may be that legislation is taking that form and that all government is drifting in that direction, but it is a rather new thing and it is rather an objectionable thing, and certainly if I were an industrialist and had big money deposited in the woodwork industry, I would not like to have my industry in that position so that on a change of Government, if I did not happen to be a good fellow to the previous Government in power, the Party succeeding them could show their spite, and there are many ways as well as direct ways by which Governments can act.  For instance, they might want to get back their own from somebody who had displeased them at any time before&mdash;&mdash; 
     
      
       Hear, hear. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Gorey may say &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; but this is not a thing that, in my opinion, should be commended. There is very big capital invested in the sawmilling industry and in woodwork generally, and it would be a good thing if some means could be suggested by which they could carry on their business on more secure terms than this Bill will allow.  I do not propose to withdraw the amendment, but I can realise that up to the present it has not been received with favour.  At the same time I would wish that more convincing arguments had been used against it. 
       Amendment put and negatived. 
     
     
      
       I move amendment 13 which reads:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (4), page 4, line 3 to insert in brackets immediately before the word &ldquo;after&rdquo; the words &ldquo;(not being less than twelve calendar months).&rdquo; 
       In the event of the Minister desiring to compel replanting, he must give a minimum of twelve months. 
       Amendment put, and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
     
     &ldquo;In the event of the Minister   refusing to grant a licence an appeal shall lie to the Judge of the Circuit Court who on being satisfied that the removal of the tree is desirable for the economic working of the holding, may grant such licence.&rdquo; 
     It was generally conceded on Second Reading that the Minister was taking too much powers throughout the Bill. In fact, I think in the majority of the sections the Minister has power to withdraw or give consent.  Notwithstanding what has been said by a previous speaker, we have every confidence that the Government will do the right thing, and will not withhold consent where it is pointed out that consent is necessary or essential, and that nothing wrong will be done.  At the same time we have had experience of Orders of Departments, and we know that they are not always correct, that there are occasions even when they may err.  Accordingly, I think it would be no harm if there was an appeal to some person.  It has been stated that if there was an appeal to the Circuit Court, it would be only on a point of law.  I do not mind having the appeal to anyone else, the Judicial Commissioner, for instance.  I think that we should have an appeal to some person; I do not mind whether it is the Circuit Judge, the District Justice, or the Judicial Commissioner. 
     
      
       I am not quite clear what the effect of this will be.  I think the amendment is to be taken as an amendment to Section 5.  Section 5 reads:&mdash; 
       The Minister may if he so thinks fit grant to any person a licence in the prescribed form to cut down or uproot any tree specified in such licence. 
       Section 5 deals with all sorts of trees and all sorts of applications.  The Bill provides that trees might be cut down for all sorts of purposes, under all sorts of conditions, under licence given by the Minister.  Then would follow:&mdash; 
     
     &ldquo;In the event of the Minister refusing to grant a licence an appeal shall lie to the Judge of the Circuit Court who on being satisfied that the removal of the tree is desirable for   the economic working of the holding, may grant such licence.&rdquo; 
     This is really an appeal on one little point.  The Minister may refuse to have a wood cut down that has nothing to do with the working of the holding. There may be an application to cut trees for firewood, to cut trees for building, and for a number of purposes which would have nothing to do with the working of the holding.  Of course, most trees are cut for use outside the holding, and for reasons which have nothing to do with the holding, and yet an appeal to the Circuit Court Judge would be an appeal on that point; on the question whether the Minister's refusal of a licence was justifiable, having regard to the fact that it would be desirable to remove the tree for the working of the holding.  I presume the Deputy's purpose is to provide an appeal from the Minister to the Circuit Judge in all cases.  The more I think of the proposition, the less I like it.  I think what it really comes to is that the judge would be the executive head of the forestry branch. You are making the Judicial Commissioner, who of course is a High Court Judge, or a Circuit Court Judge, the executive head of the forestry branch. You are giving him no law to administer. He uses his discretion.  A judge should never use his discretion.  That is a wide statement, but it is not far wrong.  A judge should interpret law. 
     
      
       He can use his discretion on the witness. 
     
     
      
       A judge should interpert law.  He should have a code of law to interpret.  Here you have no law.  I admit that.  Everything is left within certain limits to the discretion of the Minister.  By the Minister is really meant the Department. This discretion is very wide. There are a certain limited number of cases where the discretion is taken away&mdash;for instance, in the case of exempted trees.  They are a limited number. Outside this the Department itself has discretion.  That is the whole point and purpose of the Bill.  There has not been any attempt made in the Bill, and I do not see how any could be made, to lay down the particular considerations which the Department should take into   account when exercising discretion. You could not possibly cover these in a Bill.  They change with each particular case.  Moreover, if you lay down these considerations it would amount to nothing, because the Minister could still without any reference to them exercise his discretion, and there is no appeal from him.  A judge would be in exactly the same position, except that he would probably know considerably less about the considerations that should influence his decision in cases like these than the forestry branch. After all, it is their business.  They are supposed to be technical experts in forestry.  They have long experience of the working of the Forestry Acts. They are engaged in developing forestry and know all about the difficulties of administration. 
       How is a judge to exercise discretion in forestry without any experience, and without any connection with forestry and with no law of any kind to go on? There would be something essentially unsound and amateurish, in giving such discretion to a judge, and I do not believe a judge would exercise it.  I do not know what rights a judge would have in such circumstances.  Supposing a case came before a judge, I believe that what would likely happen is the judge would announce: &ldquo;I have no law,&rdquo;&ldquo;I have no information.&rdquo;&ldquo;I will simply leave things as they are.&rdquo; It would be a complete misunderstanding of the judicial position to ask a judge to exercise jurisdiction in cases of that kind.  It would lead nowhere. Any Circuit Judge, a first-class lawyer, a man who never had anything to do with farming, agriculture or forestry, when cases like that came before him to decide whether a person should or should not cut trees, would say: &ldquo;There is no evidence before me except that of the man that he wants to cut them badly.&rdquo; Even if a judge gets evidence from the forestry branch against that, the judge does not know what weight to give it; he has no law to interpret it; and he is exercising jurisdiction on a subject of which he has no knowledge. That section would make a Circuit Judge the Forestry Department. 
     
     
      
       When we were dealing with the Licensing Act a short time   ago we had practically the same issue to contend with.  The question was what should be the compensation and how it should be arrived at, and that was left to an arbitrator.  Could we not have an appeal to an arbitrator or to a referee on the same lines under this Bill?  Owners of trees are as much entitled to it as the publicans are.  There was an appeal to the Circuit Judge in that case, and the same argument, that he had no discretion, could be used in that case. 
     
     
      
       No, there is machinery in that Act for the courts to assess compensation. 
     
     
      
       But it was left to arbitration. I ask that the word &ldquo;arbitrator&rdquo; be put in. 
     
     
      
       What the Deputy should ask for is that the arbitrator be made the executive head of the Forestry Department. 
     
     
      
       Oh no. 
     
     
      
       That is what it comes to. 
     
     
      
       I want an appeal to some person, I do not mind who. 
     
     
      
       I believe that that would simply ruin the Bill.  It would make it quite impossible. 
     
     
      
       I will leave it over for the Report Stage, and perhaps it can be discussed again. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
       Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash; put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(1)  The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, grant to any person a general permit in the prescribed form to cut down or uproot any trees in any specified wood in the ordinary course of thinning or clearing such wood either with a view to re-planting or in accordance with the general practice of good forestry. 
       (2)  Every application for a permit under this section shall be in the prescribed form and contain the prescribed particulars. 
     
     (3)  A permit granted under this   section may be granted for any period not exceeding one year. 
     (4)  A permit granted under the section may be recalled by the Minister at any time.&rdquo; 
     This is to enable the Department to give a general permit to anyone who is doing forestry work to do anything he likes in connection with a forest&mdash;to thin, transplant, and so on. 
     Amendment put and agreed to. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;All contracts made prior to the 1st day of May, 1928, for the purchase or sale of standing timber, may be carried out without restriction but subject to the provisions of Section 8.  Copies of all such contracts shall be filed with the Minister at the passing of this Act.&rdquo; 
       I would suggest to the Minister that the 1st May is at least as reasonable as 1st April.  It happens that I know of an individual case where a contract was made on the 1st April.  I do not know the particular person concerned, and I am not pleading for him.  What I mean is that the contract was not made having regard to the Bill, or anything of that sort, and unless the Minister has a very strong reason for it I suggest that the 1st May is at least as reasonable as the 1st April. 
     
     
      
       Could the Minister take the 25th April, the date of the introduction of the Bill? 
     
     
      
       Perhaps we will discuss that on Report.  I am disposed to stick to the 1st April, but the Deputy could put in an amendment to the amendment that has already been inserted, and we could discuss it on that. I am strongly inclined to leave it to the 1st April. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
       New section put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 7. 
       (1)  It shall be the duty of the owner of any wood to take such steps as may be necessary by fencing or otherwise to prevent trees growing in such wood from being damaged or destroyed by horses, mules, asses, goats, sheep or cattle. 
     
     
        (2)  If any person makes default in complying with the provisions of this section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds. 
     
      
       This section must be withdrawn, in view of the next amendment. 
       Question: &ldquo;That Section 7 stand part of the Bill,&rdquo; put and declared lost. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Before Section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(1)  The Minister may make and cause to be personally served on any person who is the owner of a wood containing seedlings or saplings a notice requiring such person to take such steps as may be necessary by fencing or otherwise to prevent seedlings or saplings growing in such woods from being damaged or destroyed by horses, mules, asses, goats, sheep or cattle. 
       (2)  If any such person in respect of whom a notice has been made under this section and upon whom such notice has been personally served makes default in complying with the provisions of such notice he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds. 
       (3)  No tree of over twenty years old shall be deemed to be a seedling or sapling for the purposes of this section.&rdquo; 
       This is an attempt to improve on the section that has just been deleted. Deputy Cooper pointed out on a previous occasion that the police might come down on the owner of a wood and summon him for trespass without any previous notice.  To meet that case I propose the amendment.  There is no offence except in the non-compliance. 
     
     
      
       From my reading of it, the first sub-section of this proposed new section could very easily stop at the word &ldquo;destroyed.&rdquo; The addition of &ldquo;horses, mules, asses, goats, sheep or cattle&rdquo; is a blot on the Bill by restricting it to these animals.  There are other animals. 
     
     
     
      
       Does the Deputy mean pigs? 
     
     
      
       There are several, such as squirrels and rabbits.  There can be several methods of destruction. 
     
     
      
       But it would be too much to compel an owner to provide against squirrels or rabbits.  He might not be able to do it. 
     
     
      
       Squirrels cannot be provided against, but rabbits are a great source of destruction, and if netting were sunk four or five inches in the ground&mdash;&mdash; 
     
     
      
       That would cost a good deal of money. 
     
     
      
       I know it would.  I think that it is a blot on the Bill to put such animals in. 
     
     
      
       I would consider that before the Report Stage. 
       New section put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 8. 
       (1)  Every proprietor of any sawmill or factory in which timber grown in Saorstat Eireann is sawn or converted from the round or rough state shall furnish in the prescribed form to the Minister, within twenty-eight days after being required by the Minister so to do, such information as the Minister may require in relation to the source of supply, volume, and variety of such timber so sawn or converted in such sawmill or factory. 
       (2)  If any person on being required under this section by the Minister to furnish any information fails or refuses to furnish such information or furnishes information which is false or misleading in any material respect, or other wise makes default in complying with this section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds and in the case of a continuing offence a further fine not exceeding ten pounds for every day during which the offence is continued. 
     
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       In sub-section (1), page 4, line 54, to delete the words &ldquo;grown in Saorstat Eireann.&rdquo; 
       This meets Deputy Ryan's point of view.  Deputy Ryan's amendment is to insert the words &ldquo;or outside Saorstat Eireann.&rdquo; My amendment is to leave out both, and then it will read: &ldquo;Every proprietor of any sawmill or factory in which timber is sawn....&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Deputy Ryan is satisfied. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(2)  Every exporter of timber in the round or rough state shall furnish in the prescribed form to the Minister, within twenty-eight days after being required by the Minister so to do, such information as the Minister may require in relation to the source of supply, volume, and variety of such timber exported by him from Saorstat Eireann during the period specified in that behalf in the requisition.&rdquo; 
       That speaks for itself.  It would be very difficult to administer the Bill unless we could get returns of that sort, and the House has already agreed that returns should be made by saw-millers. 
       Amendment put and agreed to. 
       Question: &ldquo;That Section 8. as amended, stand part of the Bill,&rdquo; put and agreed to. 
       Sections 9, 10, 11 and 12 put and agreed to. 
       SECTION 13. 
       This Act may be cited as the Forestry Act, 1928, and the Short Title and Principal Act and this Act may be cited together as the Forestry Citation Acts, 1919 and 1928. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(2)  This Act shall come into operation on such day as shall be fixed for that purpose by an order of the Minister.&rdquo; 
     
     
        Obviously there should be an appointed day for the coming into operation of the Act, and this provides that. 
     Amendment put and agreed to. 
     Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 13, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to. 
     SCHEDULE. 
     
      
       I beg to move amendment 25:&mdash; 
       To delete the following words and figures&mdash; 
       &ldquo;No. 19 of 1927, the Land Act, 1927, Section 3, sub-section (3).&rdquo; 
       That enactment was repealed in the Schedule, but we propose to let it stand.  It is rather a nice point.  Section 3 (3) of the Land Act of 1927 deals only with land from the time that it vests in the Land Commission to the time that it vests in the tenant. During that time the Land Commission is collecting rents and the occupier is still just the tenant, with merely a tenant's right to the forest.  We do not propose to alter that&mdash;we think it is correct.  Somebody else may have a right to the timber, but once the land is vested in fee-simple in the tenant different considerations arise. 
       Amendment agreed to. 
       Schedule, as amended, agreed to. 
       Title agreed to. 
       Bill ordered to be reported with amendments. 
       The Dail went out of Committee.

     PUBLIC BUSINESS. - GAS REGULATION BILL, 1928&mdash;REPORT. 
     
      
       I move amendment 1:&mdash; 
       In page 3, line 8, to delete the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;fifteen.&rdquo; 
     
     
      
       Amendments 1 and 2 go together. 
     
     
      
       The period of ten years for reverification is too short.  Persons who have been engaged for several years in this business, and who have inherited   the experience and knowledge of the previous generation, say that twenty-five years would be a reasonable time for reverification, and that in practice there is very little use for it.  Gas companies and consumers keep a watch over the meters, and if any irregularity is detected, the meter is re-tested.  The consumer of gas has the right to require his meter to be taken out and re-tested if he considers it is not correct.  Equally, the gas companies re-test their meters if they have any idea that the meters are registering against them.  The six-year period for reverification suggested by Deputy Anthony is altogether too short and, in the circumstances which will arise after the passing of this Bill into law, it is altogether unreasonable, having regard to the arrears of meters to be re-tested.  There is no provision requiring reverification in any English or American gas legislation.  It is understood that the question was considered in England, but the principle of reverification did not appear to the Board of Trade to be desirable or necessary, and it has not been adopted. The expense of reverification is unnecessary. Meters in existence for 30, 40, and even 50 years have been tested and found to be accurate.  The fact that both consumers and the companies have the right at any time to have the meters tested is sufficient protection to both of them. 
       As far as the consumer is concerned, the experience of meters going out of order is that they work in favour of the consumer in registering less gas than actually passes through, so that the company for their own protection, if they are not satisfied, test the meters from time to time.  In addition, the expense thrown on the companies would very seriously injure the smaller undertakings. In the case of Cork and Dublin, while the expenses would be heavy, the companies would be strong enough to bear it, but there is grave danger of the smaller companies being crushed out of existence. 
     
     Since the Minister has thought well to adopt the principle, the time mentioned is too short.  A term of fifteen years is a reasonable period in the opinion of those qualified to judge.   The companies could make their calculations accordingly if that time were allowed, but if a shorter period is insisted on it would inflict very grave injury on the smaller undertakings and may so interfere as to close them down.  If such a thing took place in any district, it would be a very serious affair.  As we all know, the people who will be most affected probably will be the smaller consumers of gas &mdash;the workingman who has a gas stove or oven.  Expense like this is necessarily passed on to the consumers and they certainly will not thank us for putting unnecessary expense upon them. 
     
      
       I should like to support the remarks made by Deputy Egan.  He has said everything I could say.  Really no case has been made out for reverification of meters.  As he said, it has been left to the Free State to discover the necessity for this. It is not required in England or anywhere else.  He also said, quite rightly, that the cost of all this would tell very much against the poor consumer of gas&mdash;the workingman.  Most of the meters, at any rate in Dublin, are used by such people, and if gas companies are put to any very great expense in connection with this the expense will not ultimately be borne by the gas undertaking, but will be put on to the price of gas.  Therefore, the least the Minister could do, if he insists on re-verification, is to extend the time to fifteen years. 
     
     
      
       I am certainly surprised, if not alarmed, by the wonderful solicitude of Deputy Egan and Deputy Murphy for the poor working man.  From the beginning it was quite evident that both Deputy Egan and Deputy Murphy were well briefed for vested interests, as represented by the gas companies, whether these gas companies be located in Cork or in Dublin. I am very glad to see such an awakening of interest and such solicitude, as I have said, for the poor working man and the small consumer&mdash;names to conjure with at times of elections. There is one thing I can do this evening, as I have sometimes done before, and that is at least to pay some tribute   to the Minister for making an attempt to protect the consumer.  Notwithstanding all that has been said by Deputy Egan in his carefully-prepared and, I am sure, inspired statement, I must pay some tribute, at any rate, to the Minister for making a genuine attempt to protect the consumer. 
       This amendment of Deputy Egan seeks to substitute the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;ten.&rdquo; Perhaps it may be news to Deputy Egan and also to Deputy Murphy to know, or to hear, perhaps, for the first time, that five years is the term for which makers guarantee new meters.  Therefore, I cannot understand the reason which actuated either of these Deputies to ask the House to substitute the term of fifteen years for that of ten years.  It has been argued that because such a thing as this is not in operation anywhere else it should not be put in operation in the Free State.  If we are to pursue that class of argument we should wait for something to be done in Great Britain before we do anything on our own in this country.  I have sufficient national pride, at any rate, to suggest to this House that possibly when this Bill passes into law the people across the Channel may wake up and do something likewise.  This is not the first time that this nation gave a lead to other countries on legislation such as is under consideration in this House at the moment.  I might also say in that respect that Cork has always taken the lead. 
       We hear something about smaller companies and the question of what it would cost these companies to get the meters tested once in every ten years. I would like the House to appreciate what is suggested in the Bill, and also to pay attention to what I suggest in my amendment.  I suppose I would be in order in taking my amendment and that of Deputy Egan at the same time. It is simply a difference of a few years, but it makes all the difference to those engaged in the industry.  Somebody said something about the expense that would ensue if meters had to be sent from the small cities and towns to have the meters re-tested. 
     
     
      
       resumed the chair. 
     
     
     
      
       If either of the Deputies who have spoken, or the Minister, is prepared to have the meters tested  in situ  I am prepared to agree to that.  In the Bill as presented we have certain safeguards for the consumers, and while Deputy Egan has spoken as to having sought information from people who know something of the industry, I, too, have sought information from people connected with the industry, and my information goes to show that the expenses entailed are not of the proportions suggested by Deputy Egan.  I would issue, if I were permitted to do so under the Standing Orders, a challenge, and let my amendment stand or fall upon that challenge.  I am prepared to say that the position in relation to the cost that would be entailed by bringing these meters to the testing stations in Cork or Dublin was, at least, one hundred per cent. over-estimated by Deputy Egan. 
       I suggest, in my amendment, that there should be a limit to the time that a meter may be used before it is re-tested. In the Bill presented to us the Minister suggested ten years.  In my amendment I suggest to substitute six years for ten years.  I submit to the Minister and to the House, in view of the fact that the makers of these meters guarantee them for a term of only five years, that that in itself is a very serious and good reason why we should insist that meters should be re-tested within a period of, say, five or six years.  I suggest six years as a compromise between the original amendment I put down and ten years.  I can see no reason why this House should be asked to vote for an amendment giving a period of fifteen years. In my view, and in the view of those in the industry competent to judge and who have experience of from fifteen to fifty years, the period I suggest would be the correct period in the interest of the consumers and all those connected with the industry.  I ask Deputies to weigh carefully this amendment and the amendment of Deputy Egan suggesting a term of fifteen years, and I contend that I have the weight of logic and experience behind the amendment I am moving. 
     
     
     
      
       Deputy Anthony issued a challenge.  I accept it, and I remind him that he said that his amendment stands or falls on the result of that challenge. 
     
     
      
       The question, I take it, that we are discussing is not whether there should or should not be a periodical re-verification of meters, but rather the term which should elapse between each such re-verification.  There are three suggestions before the House. The term of six years is suggested by Deputy Anthony, the term of ten years is mentioned in the Bill, and I presume the Minister adheres to that, and then there is the term of fifteen years suggested by Deputy Barry Egan.  There has been mentioned by Deputy Anthony, and I think he is correct, that the period for which a meter is guaranteed by the makers to be accurate is five years.  I think it is only fair to assume that a meter will, in fact, remain accurate for a longer period than that.  If Deputy Anthony buys a watch from a jeweller he will, as has been pointed out, get a guarantee of one, three or five years with the watch, but he can generally rely on the watch keeping accurate for a longer period than that covered by the maker's guarantee.  We have to consider that the re-verification of meters will cost something.  Whether it will cost what certain interests allege it will cost, or half that, as Deputy Anthony stated, does not really concern the argument, because the cost, whatever it is, will eventually be passed on to the consumer. If the re-verification is to take place frequently, the cost will be high, and if it is to take place at less frequent intervals it will be low.  What we want to do is to strike a medium to ensure that the actual additional cost of re-verification, which will be passed on to the consumer, will not be high enough to rob the consumer of any benefits which re-verification will give him. 
     
     Considering that the meter is guaranteed for five years and can be relied on to remain accurate for a considerable number of years beyond that, and also that experience has shown that, in the majority of cases, the inaccuracy which develops in the meter is in favour of   the consumer and not of the gas company, I am inclined to the opinion that the term mentioned in the Bill is the most equitable.  As far as I am concerned, I will oppose both amendments and adhere to the ten years' period mentioned in the Bill. 
     
      
       Deputy Lemass has said a great deal of what I had intended to say, except this, that his argument has led me to the decision to support the amendment suggesting the fifteen years' period rather than to adhere to the term in the Bill.  It seems to me that the question of expense is the really important thing.  That, as Deputy Lemass has said, will undoubtedly ultimately fall upon the consumer.  It is the consumer who will have to pay, probably in getting a less quantity of gas for his money than he got before.  I want to raise that point particularly in connection with a class of consumers mentioned by me on different stages of the Bill.  They are not an entirely unimportant class, that is, those who happen to own their own meters.  I know at least one very large consumer of that kind.  I have not exact information beside me, but I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that that particular consumer might have fifty large meters.  The expense of having these meters verified would be very considerable indeed.  If that expense had to be gone through every five years, or even every ten years, it would mean very considerable additional cost to that particular consumer. 
     
     I think Deputy Lemass was also quite correct in saying that in the great majority of cases the fault that develops in a meter is one which ultimately tends to benefit the consumer, and even in the odd case where it does not, it is a fault which is generally detected very quickly by the consumer when he finds that he is not getting proper value for the gas for which he is paying.  All this argument seems to me to lead very strongly to the desirability of making this period over which re-verification must take place as lengthy a period as we can do with safety.  It seems to me that fifteen years is a much better period to choose   than ten.  With reference to the distinction that has been made between Dublin, Cork and other places, I think the remarks that I wish to make on that would arise better on one of the other amendments that are to follow. 
     
      
       I support the point of view that has been urged by Deputy Lemass.  I certainly am of the opinion that the consumer needs all the protection that the Minister proposes to give him in this Bill.  It is all very well for Deputy Barry Egan to say that this is going to increase the cost of gas to the consumer and put forward arguments of that kind.  Take the case of the ordinary consumer of gas in the City of Dublin.  As things are at present, he is absolutely at the mercy of the gas company.  I know that quite recently there have been very many complaints made as to the amount of gas received and the amount of gas charged for.  Deputy Barry Egan said that the consumer had some rights under this Bill.  In the City of Dublin what happens in practice is: a man comes in and checks your meter. In the case of an ordinary penny-in-the-slot meter, the collector tells you that your meter has consumed so much more gas than you have got money in the slot to pay for.  He tells you that the company will send you a bill for the balance, and what happens in 99 per cent. of the cases is that the consumer has to pay the extra amount charged in the bill.  I think the Minister is wise in introducing this amendment, and I propose to support the Minister and Deputy Lemass on the point at issue. 
     
     
      
       I prefer, as the question has now come to a betting match, to back Deputy Barry Egan rather than Deputy Anthony, and I do so with every possible respect for Deputy Anthony's eloquence and loud-toned talk about the poor unfortunate working man.  I think Deputy Anthony must have been listening to Deputy Cooper earlier in the day and sort of copied his tone and manner of debate in this matter.  I am quite prepared to admit that Deputy Lemass is a greater expert on gas than I am, but not on gas meters, or he would have   stopped earlier.  There is no case whatever technically for re-verification, and that is the real issue.  Anyone who knows anything about the construction of meters&mdash;I do, because it happens to be my business&mdash;knows that in modern meters you cannot envisage defects which would tend to go against the consumer unless a mouse or something of that kind got into them.  Those acquainted with the ordinary defects which belong to the technique of meters knows that.  Apparently, the House is not prepared to accept the fact that a meter is going to be right always.  The House wants some period in which there will be re-verification.  That period ought to be in the interests of the consumer, because every single charge of every sort and kind on an industry which is in free competition does go on, and it is in the interest of the consumer himself that the period should be as long as possible. 
     
     
      
       That is an interesting doctrine. 
     
     
      
       I am prepared to stand over that, and over most interesting doctrines.  I am for the longest period. I am for a period of 20 years if the Minister says 20 years, and for a period of 25 years if he says 25.  As the longest period proposed is 15 that is why I am backing it, but if anyone proposes a longer period I would be in favour of it.  I hope that by the time the period is out very little gas will be used and that we will have reached a stage in which we will not be using meters of that kind.  I am sorry Deputy Lemass has wandered the straight path, as he has in not being in agreement with me.  I am saying that now because in some future time there may be a difference of opinion, and Deputy Lemass and other members of the House will recognise that when they differ from me they are wrong. 
     
     
      
       The House is now in a difficult position, for it knows there is no technical justification for any re-verification.  Although the House has passed that it knows now from what Deputy Flinn has said that it will have to stultify itself by continuing on with this proposition which it accepted on the Committee Stage.   Then we have Deputy Barry Egan's argument that re-verification would impose a most extraordinary burden on the gas companies which would be unloaded on to the consumers.  What are the facts with regard to the burden?  In Dublin alone there are in use in consumers' premises about 72,000 meters belonging to the Dublin Gas Company.  In the last five years 47,000 of these have in fact been repaired and re-verified.  They have been coming in at the rate of 9,000 a year&mdash;I mean on the average, and not that they are coming in actually at that rate.  We are asking that they should come in compulsorily every ten years.  The Gas Company has in the past been bearing, or passing on to the consumer, the cost of the verification of meters at the rate of 5,000 per annum.  We are asking that they should do it at the rate of 8,000.  That is the difference.  Of the 47,000 meters examined in the five years a couple of hundred or a couple of thousand of these may have been examined two or three times on complaints made.  That may be, but what we are insisting on is that instead of a select number being brought in by some process under the 1859 Act every meter should be brought in within a ten years' period. 
     
     It is for the House to consider whether for the expense to be incurred by the gas company, and to be borne by the consumer afterwards, there is at any rate now secured to the consumer accuracy and fairness. We have Deputy Flinn's statement that there is no technical justification for any verification, and, therefore, we should leave it in the hands of the good, beneficent and technically unable-to-do-wrong gas companies, and in opposition to that that you have simply to estimate the expenditure. I do not know if Deputy Anthony is moving for six years.  Between the six years and the 15 years there is certainly a big difference, and the six years would, I think, in so far as one can find from calculation as to what is actually happening at the moment, put some extra burdens on the gas companies compared to what they have been bearing.  As Deputy Lemass said, 15 years would give them greater   latitude.  On the last occasion, in regard to this amendment, I think I got assent from every part of the House for taking the 10 years' period.  Even with the 10 years' period being set down for the purpose of having an argument as to that period, I remember stating that if we got an amendment allowing for testing on the site that that definitely had to be taken in conjunction with that period.  If one eases the situation for the gas company by allowing testing to be done on the site less objection could be taken to the length of the period within which re-verification would have to take place. We are now proposing to have testing on the site, and I offer 10 years as a reasonable period for re-verification. 
     Amendment put and declared lost. 
     Amendment 2, by leave, withdrawn. 
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       In page 3, to delete lines 14 to 26 and substitute the words &ldquo;in respect of any meter whichever of the following periods is the lesser, that is to say, the period of two years from the passing of this Act, or the period during which such meter remains continuously so installed after the passing of this Act.&rdquo; 
       The arguments I used in favour of the first amendment could also be very well used in support of this, and this amendment would reassure the public mind when the Bill becomes an Act. 
     
     
      
       The objection to this amendment is the same as to the other.  The amendment, as it stands, makes a reasonable distinction between two types of meter, one the type brought into the country and installed in the consumer's premises without any stamp, and the other the type that came in with the Board of Trade stamp and passed some test with regard to accuracy.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the section as it stands recognises that, and the distinction is made with regard to the different periods in which they are to be brought in.  I object to the amendment in so far as it destroys that reasonable distinction.  I think that the five years and the two years periods in the Bill might be left there,   for though the period of five years is established as the maximum period, as described in paragraph (a) of sub-section (3) of Section 5, in fact a lot of these meters will be possibly tested earlier than the five years period, for there will be in all these meters a repercussion of sub-section 2.  In other words, a meter bearing the Board of Trade stamp for eight years will have to be verified within two years, for though the five years would be the maximum for the type of meter spoken of in paragraph (a) it will not be the period for all the meters.  I think the Deputy will admit there is a reasonable distinction as between the two types of meters I have referred to, and he perhaps will withdraw the amendment. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       In page 3, line 26, to add at the end of Section 5 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(4)  The provisions of sub-section (2) shall not apply to undertakers situate in areas outside the jurisdictions of county boroughs that have adopted the Act of 1859.&rdquo; 
     
     This amendment affects Section 8 of the Bill, and is intended to dispense with the necessity for periodical re-verification of meters outside the boroughs which adopted the Gas Act of 1859&mdash;namely, Dublin and Cork. One of the reasons in favour of the amendment is that, except in a few cities, there are comparatively few meters, and the gas companies are working in a very small way.  The expense would bear heavily on consumers in small towns without any gain in comparison with the expense involved.  In the second place, the test for such re-verification would have to be done in Dublin, as the Cork station is too small.  There are no other stations outside those two.  In either event, the cost of testing and stamping would be very great.  Small companies would need a reserve supply of meters and in the event of the test proving expensive, it would mean further expense in the supply of gas.  I think that the argument which I brought forward on my first amendment applies also to the present amendment.   If this section passes without an amendment such as this, it will mean that the cost of gas will have to be increased to the consumer. 
     
      
       Is there any necessity to press this amendment if the Minister gives an undertaking, as promised, that he will make arrangements to have meters examined on the site? 
     
     
      
       I would not like to have it taken for granted that the method of testing on the site is to be the method adopted in future.  That may or may not be the case.  We will, however, have to see what are the comparative costs between testing on the site and testing at the station.  I think there are very inaccurate ideas abroad as to the difference in the cost.  Deputy Egan states that the number of meters outside Dublin and Cork is very small. 
     
     
      
       I mean apart from places such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and Waterford. 
     
     
      
       Yes, and consequently there will be very little expense other than in Dublin or Cork.  It is for the House, having decided that re-verification is a principle, to say whether they now cut away all the meters, even though the residue be small, except those in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and Waterford.  It is a question if the consumer needs protection anywhere, does he need protection less outside Dublin and Cork? 
     
     
      
       My argument is that the consumer is amply protected by the system which has been carried on up to now. 
     
     
      
       Then why introduce the Bill at all? 
     
     
      
       I think that the Bill ought to operate in the towns as well as the cities.  We do not get gas bills in the country, but we pay 1/3 a quarter for the use of a meter.  We do not get any advantage in a reduction in the price of coal.  We do not want to fleece the gas companies, but we should be treated fairly.  Deputy Egan says that there are very few meters in towns like Midleton, Mallow and Fermoy.  I wonder is he serious in that? 
     
     
     
      
       I am. 
     
     
      
       At any rate I claim that the Bill should apply to the towns as well as the cities. 
     
     
      
       There appears to be a great deal of doubt as to what particular amendment we are on. 
     
     
      
       I have no doubt. 
     
     
      
       I have an objection from the Dublin City Commissioners to changing the present system of testing meters. 
     
     
      
       That comes up on Amendment 6. 
       Amendment put and negatived. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       In page 3, line 26, to add at the end of Section 5 a new sub-section as follows&mdash; 
       &ldquo;(2)  All meters required by law to be stamped shall be examined, tested, and stamped, under the provisions of the Act of 1859, as amended by this or any other Act in the order of priority in which such meters are presented for such examination, testing, or stamping.&rdquo; 
     
     This amendment is intended to allay the fears expressed by some small companies that in the event of congestion at the testing station, as a result of the passing of the Act, the claims of companies in Dublin and Cork will be given priority to those of companies outside those boroughs.  It is thought that the amendment, which will do nobody any harm, will ensure, in view of the fact that there may be congestion, that small companies will have their meters tested in the order of priority in which they are presented.  As Deputy Egan pointed out, the Cork station is small, and it may not be able to cope with all the business.  The same may apply to Dublin, and it is not likely that a new station will be established.  I think there is in some Act a provision that a meter presented by a company in Dublin or Cork to a testing station must be stamped and tested within three days of its presentation.  That would only apply to meters presented by these companies, but not to those presented by those outside the boroughs mentioned. It might happen that small   companies throughout the country might suffer considerable delay in this respect and might be guilty of a technical breach of the Act as a consequence. Therefore, I suggest that this amendment which, as I say, does harm to nobody should be inserted. 
     
      
       I have a variety of objections to this amendment.  I think that Section 4 carries forward all obligations which used to be on the inspector in regard to the two boroughs. 
     
     
      
       If that is so I am prepared to withdraw the amendment. 
     
     
      
       There is a monetary penalty on the inspector if he fails to stamp within three days of presentation. There will be varying periods involved. Imagine a station with a number of meters for testing, some of which have to run eight years and others to run ten.  It would be wrong if those had to be stamped in the order of priority.  I think that Section 4 carries on all the obligations I have mentioned. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
     
     
      
       I move:&mdash; 
       In page 3, line 26, to add at the end of Section 5 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;A gas undertaker shall not be convicted for failure to comply with any enactment requiring any meter to be duly stamped unless it is shown that such failure was due to or arose out of the circumstances within the control of such undertaker.&rdquo; 
     
     This amendment is somewhat akin to the last one.  It is to avoid any injustice being inflicted in consequence of the possibility of congestion in either of the gas testing stations.  It is to ensure, also, that a gas undertaker shall not be convicted for failure to comply with any enactment requiring any meter to be duly stamped unless it is shown that such failure was due to, or arose out of, circumstances within the control of such undertaker.  In the event of congestion at the testing station circumstances might conceivably arise which would compel a gas   undertaking to keep an unstamped meter in a place for a longer period than the Act allows, or to continue a stamped meter for a longer period than the Act allows.  It is to provide against the possibility of an injustice of that nature being inflicted that this amendment is moved. 
     
      
       The amendment as explained, seems to be much less formidable than as put down.  It goes much further than what the Deputy wants to ensure.  It means in every case that the onus of proof will be thrown on the inspector.  I think it will be accepted that generally the onus of proof is thrown on the person who has a peculiar knowledge which the other person has no opportunity of getting.  In this case the inspector would have thrown on him the onus of proving that the failure was due to or arose out of circumstances within the control of the undertaker, the undertaker being the only person who could explain the circumstances and which he can at present explain by way of defence.  It is a reasonable ground for defence, but as put down it would mean that it would apply to every case in which the inspector would appear as an opponent of the gas undertaking.  He would have to prove positively that whatever was complained of was due to or arose out of circumstances within the control of the undertaker.  If the amendment is meant to apply to the point upon which Deputy Lemass spoke, I think we could leave the matter to be dealt with under the Act of 1859, because there the inspector is bound to test the meters within three days unless he can give reasonable grounds for delay.  Obviously, there would be reasonable grounds for delay if the station were full of meters, so that it would be quite impossible to get through in time.  In fact it would probably be such reasonable ground that no departmental inspector would like to urge the initiation of proceedings against the company in the circumstances the Deputy explains.  I think that the point is met, but it is only met in the way I have stated before&mdash; the carrying forward of the penalty in the Act of 1859. 
       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
     
     
     
      
       The discussion on amendment 8 can hardly be concluded to-night and as this is the Report Stage there are two amendments which I would wish to have amalgamated and in which at the same time I would like to make a change. I would like, therefore, to give notice of an amendment which I propose to offer inelieu of amendments 9 and 10. Amendment 9 states that &ldquo;an Order made by the Minister under this section shall before coming into effect be laid on the Table of the Dail and if within 21 days during which the Dail has sat a resolution is passed by the Dail disagreeing with the Order such Order shall accordingly be annulled.&rdquo; Deputy Egan's amendment is much the same, except perhaps in regard to one point, which I think is valuable, that, unless the Order is made on the application of an undertaker, it shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and shall not come into operation until approved by a resolution passed by each such House.  The form in which that type of regulation has appeared in previous Bills has more or less been this:&mdash; 
       &ldquo;Every order made by the Minister under this section other than an order made on the application of an undertaker shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution is passed by either such House within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat annulling such order, such order shall be annulled accordingly.&rdquo; 
       Accordingly I am giving notice that I wish to put forward an amendment to that effect. 
     
     
      
       Might I ask does that mean that all these orders shall have to be printed and circulated to Deputies? 
     
     
      
       &ldquo;Laid on the Table&rdquo; means that it shall be laid on the Table in the Library either in typescript or in printed form. 
     
     
      
       I am simply giving notice now that I will move this amendment to-morrow. 
     
     
     
      
       I got the amendment from the Minister some time ago and I thought before the House left the matter he should give notice of raising it to-morrow.  The amendment is of course similar to amendments 9 and 10 and is in common form.  I am prepared, therefore, to accept it and it will be on the Order Paper for to-morrow. 
     
     
      
       I move the adjournment of the Dail until 3 o'clock to-morrow. 
     
   
   
     ADJOURNMENT DEBATE. - TARIFF COMMISSION'S REPORT ON FLOUR MILLERS' APPLICATION. 
     
      
       We are anxious, as I indicated, to have an expression of view from the Executive as to what they purpose doing as a result of the Report which they have received form the Tariff Commission.  I am not quite certain that I understood the President rightly to-day, but what I understood him to say was that they intended to accept the Report and to act on it.  If that is done, it means that an essential industry is threatened.  It is not the case of an ordinary industry being threatened.  Food is one of the fundamental necessities of life, and as I understood the policy in the old days anyhow it was that we would try to make this nation as self-supporting in all essentials as possible.  Here we have a chance, if you protect this industry, of bringing that policy to a definite conclusion on that head.  We can make this country self-supporting as far as flour and bread are concerned. That this industry should be preserved goes without saying. 
     
     As it is, we are importing into this country flour and wheat to the extent of something like £7,000,000 a year.  It was calculated a short time ago that had the general strike in Great Britain gone on we would not have had a food supply, as far as bread and flour were concerned, of more than about 40 days.  As long as we are dependent on foreign countries for an essential article such as bread, it means that whenever there is a war, whenever there is any disturbance   in the countries from which we get our chief supplies, we will be cut short of that vital article.  We have heard very often here talk on the question of insurance.  Surely there is no insurance that we ought to be so careful about as insuring for ourselves a full food supply at all times.  If this milling industry is lost we are putting ourselves in a helpless position.  To start with, are we in danger of losing this essential industry if the Report of the Tariff Commission is to be acted upon?  I think that anybody who has carefully read the Report will satisfy himself that we are, and our conclusions in that respect are strengthened by the report which, I think, was published in this day's paper of Boland's Mills.  Here we have the Chairman of the Company, Mr. Sexton, saying quite deliberately that under present conditions&mdash;that is unless the industry is protected&mdash;we are going to lose our milling industry.  His actual words are these:&mdash; 
     &ldquo;I have said that the milling output increased during the year by as much as 15 per cent.&rdquo; 
     That was in reference to one particular firm. 
     &ldquo;I have to add, however, that even so it still fell short by more than 15 per cent. of what the mills are able to produce.  This is a fact of deep significance in its bearing upon the general state of the industry.  We do not know of any mills that have been worked full time; and as matters stand at present, a mill that does not work full time can make but a very poor return.  We know that many mills have closed down at frequent intervals.  We know, too, that one-third of all the mills in the State have ceased to work within a very limited period, and that they have ceased to work without any apparent prospect of restarting at any time. This simple fact speaks volumes.  If, in a limited time, one-third of all the mills have had to relinquish production, what is to happen to the remaining two-thirds?  How are they, many of them, or any of them, to escape? The answer to the question is not obscure.  Those who are best acquainted   with the situation, who are most competent to judge of the facts and to appraise the conditions, are convinced that the industry, as a whole, is foredoomed to paralysis or, commercially speaking, to extinction.&rdquo; 
     Now that that condition existed was and is pretty well known to the Deputies before they read this Report at all, and one would imagine in a matter of this kind that the Executive would have a definite national policy.  Instead of that, on a case which, to say the least of it, is unconvincing, they purpose to allow us to be for this essential article completely and absolutely dependent on Great Britain.  The conditions on the Mersey side, from which we get the greatest part of our flour, are such that the home mills have to compete under conditions which practically amount to dumping on the part of England.  It is for all intents and purposes dumping.  The consequence of it, of course, is going to be that for the time whilst they are under-cutting there may be a certain advantage in cheaper flour.  But so surely as our mills are driven out of existence, so surely, when we are absolutely dependent on that source of supply, will the prices be raised, and therefore I, for one, am convinced that even putting it on the very lowest level, that of general economy, getting things at the cheapest possible price, we are penny wise and pound foolish. 
     But, as I said, there is a higher plane on which we should regard this question, and that is, that we ought not to put ourselves in a position in which we would be dependent for food on a foreign country.  Most countries try to put themselves in a sound position in that respect.  They try in every possible way to encourage the production at home of essential articles such as food.  I have tried to see what was at the back of the minds of the Tariff Commissioners when they decided to recommend a refusal of this application.  As far as I can make out, the basis of their refusal is this: They contend that a tariff of 3/- a sack is going to mean an increase generally in the price of flour by 3/- a sack, which, by the way, is not proved at all.  As a matter of fact, there is   evidence the there need be no increase in price, and I have no doubt whatever that if the Executive or any other Government in this country were prepared to give protection to the milling industry, we would be able to get flour and bread without any increase in cost.  There have been variations of a greater amount already in the prices at which our millers and bakers get flour, and the increase has not been transferred to the customers in Cork. We have an example of this in the case of oatmeal.  We have seen the effect of the tariff upon oatmeal, which has not meant an increase in the price.  It has meant a better price in fact to the farmers&mdash;in fact almost a record price at present to the farmers for their oats, and it has meant no increase in price to the consumers of oatmeal. It has meant that instead of getting in oatmeal from outside, our millers are now in a position to export oatmeal.  Is there any ground for believing that it would not be the same in the flour-milling industry?  To my mind there is not. 
     Naturally, when these applicants come looking for a tariff they want to give themselves a margin if they can. It is there the Executive ought to come in and protect.  When they are protecting and sheltering this industry they should also protect the public against an increase in cost.  The fact that the arguments on which the Tariff Commissioners based their conclusions were not convincing is proved from the attitude of the members themselves. One of their members, whilst agreeing with his colleagues to refuse this application, sees very clearly what is going to be the result of it.  He sees very clearly that the inland mills, which are so necessary if we are going to go the whole way and make ourselves self-supporting by encouraging the growing of the wheat at home, these mills which are essential to doing that with profit and properly supplying the countryside, are likely to be crushed out.  Again, there is no reason why we should take the conclusion of the Tariff Commission that mills at the port side are more economic than inland mills.  There are millers who have experience of both, and they have   testified that it is not so, that there are special advantages, cheap water-power advantages, which the inland mills have, and which put them in a position to compete with the port mills.  The argument, then, that it will mean an increase in price is not, to my mind, conclusive.  I believe that if the Executive Council approached this question from the right attitude they would be able to get an agreement by which there would not be an increase in the price of bread. 
     At present we have the mills working very much under time.  They are not working at much more than halftime in some place&mdash;half capacity.  It is obvious if we put them working at full capacity that the overhead charges will be lessened, and that the price per unit of the product will be diminished accordingly.  Hence there is ground for believing form that point of view that their prices need not go up.  The only reason they give that I can see, as to why the price should be increased, is that the price of offals will be diminished, and that what is lost in the case of the offals for the farmers has to be added on to the flour in order to make the necessary balance.  It is a question whether, even if it were proved that an increase of price were necessary, it would not be more, in the national economy, taking the nation as a whole&mdash;whether it would not be more than offset by the advantage given to the farmers in cheaper feeding stuffs. If you were to take the average small farmer and balance his budget for the year, take his account for the year and take what he gains by the diminished offals and what he would be charged extra for the price of bread, you would not have great difficulty in proving that, on the whole, he would gain. 
     If at the present time we have&mdash;I do not admit we have, as a matter of fact &mdash;to give that amount of subsidy, if I might call it, to the farming industry, do you not think that it would repay us?  I think it would, if we had to do it, but I am not at all agreeing that it has been proved in this Report that any such increase in the price of flour would necessarily follow. 
     It was estimated at least a year or two years ago that the price on account   of the shortage of offals went up by from £1 to £2 per ton.  A plentiful supply of offals would, of course, mean a reduction in the cost, and it would mean that the farming community as a whole would have the feeding stuffs at the cheaper rate, and I believe it can be proved, if you balance the average small farmer's household budget in the year, that he would on the whole gain by that transaction. 
     I am going to pass away for the moment from the arguments about an increase in price.  People put forward the old arguments about increasing the cost of living, quite forgetting that the balance may be made up in other directions. The next reason is that it is not an industry that gives a great amount of employment, and that putting the mills on whole time would not employ a very large number of extra hands; consequently it would not help considerably towards relieving the unemployment difficulty.  There again you get a very short-sighted view taken.  All you get is that the number of those who are directly employed is 150.  You do not take into account all those who would be employed indirectly on account of the extension of the milling industry.  It is calculated that £175,000 alone could be kept in this country for bag-making; that something like £175,000 is at the present time going out of the country because the flour comes in in sacks from outside and we do not make these sacks ourselves.  The millers are prepared to give a guarantee that they will give preference to Irish manufacture, and I take it that if the Ministry were prepared to give the necessary protection to this industry, it would be in a position to demand that that would be carried out, just as it would also be in a position to see that there would, in fact, be no extra increase in the price of flour. 
     Now let us take another argument that they give for refusing the application. They say that Jacobs would possibly leave the country and transfer their factory from Dublin to Aintree, and that this country would lose the employment which is given to some 3,000 hands.  There, again, the case is a very poor one, because there is no doubt whatever that an arrangement   could be made to facilitate Messrs. Jacob which would not at all prevent the giving of the necessary protection to the flour industry.  The Minister for Finance was approached on one occasion and he indicated fairly clearly that he thought that was quite possible, but when this matter was mentioned to the Tariff Commission I think the Chairman put it aside with a &ldquo;Tut-tut; that is impossible.&rdquo; 
     
      
       Is the Deputy pretending to quote evidence given before the Tariff Commission? 
     
     
      
       I am not. 
     
     
      
       Because that is not the form in which it occurred. 
     
     
      
       It is my information of the form, and you will be able to correct it if it is not substantially correct. 
     
     
      
       The documents are open for inspection.  The applicants themselves said that they did not presume that such a demand would be granted.  That was the way they introduced it. 
     
     
      
       My information from the applicants is quite the reverse. The information I got from the applicants was to the effect that, first of all, they had a conference with the directors and legal advisers of Messrs. Jacob, as they were anxious to facilitate Messrs. Jacob in every way, that a definite formula was agreed upon, and that they expected on account of the agreement with Messrs. Jacob that when they represented that view before the Tariff Commission it would be accepted.  They were disappointed in that.  The applicants proposed to the Minister for Finance special facilities for Jacobs, amounting to an absolute free, unhampered import of flour into special store.  They agreed that special arrangements could be made.  But when Mr. Jacob referred to such a possibility in his evidence the Chairman of the Tariff Commission promptly retorted: &ldquo;That would be impossible.&rdquo; I hold that the difficulty with respect to Messrs. Jacob is not by any means insuperable.  So that if we take the three arguments we have met up to the present, that about increasing the cost,   about the small number of people that would be employed, and the one about Messrs. Jacob, I think, considering the magnitude of the decision involved here, that none of the arguments are sufficiently sound for the Executive to run the risk, as it is, of losing an essential industry.  To me it is not an ordinary question of the refusal of a tariff and opposing part of the general national policy which we agree to; here it is a question of running the risk of losing a vital industry.  As I said here on a previous occasion, we ought to aim at making this country self-supporting in all the essentials.  Food is the primary essential.  We have an opportunity here of making ourselves self-supporting in all the articles of food. We have an opportunity of keeping a sum of seven million pounds yearly, ultimately&mdash;half of it at the start&mdash;in this country instead of sending it out. The experiments that have been made recently by the Agricultural Department have proved that wheat-growing in this country is a possibility; that the growing in this country of the wheat we require is not a dream but a thing that a Government so disposed could definitely set out for with the hope of ultimately achieving it.  One of the factors necessary for that to be successful is to keep the local inland mills in existence. 
     
     I do not know if the Executive Council is prepared to take the Minority Report and deal with the matter by way of bounty, but it would not be sufficient.  That is another matter.  A bounty on wheat-growing is a separate problem.  The first thing we want is to develop the milling industry to the fullest capacity.  At full capacity at the present time it would be able to produce 90 per cent. of the wheat required.  From the figures we have been supplied with I believe that we could supply our full demand, because the maximum amount that the mills are capable of turning out would approximate very closely to the 2,900,000 sacks that we require annually.  To us it is, therefore, a fundamental matter.  If the Executive are going to turn down this application and deny the protection needed against what is practically dumping from the other side, then they are   certainly going to do a very bad thing for the country, and they are going to do something which we will oppose by every means in our power.  There are a number of other speakers to follow and I am quite satisfied that points which I have only touched on generally will be dealt with in detail by them.  As a matter of fact there is ample material for anybody, both in the Report itself and in the case as given to us by the applicants.  I hope the members of this House who have minds, and show that they have minds by being susceptible to change, will in this case carefully consider whether they should not by a motion of this House compel the Executive to take a different line of action. 
     
      
       It is generally admitted in this House that agriculture and the people engaged in it pay roughly 80 per cent. of the expenses of the nation.  According to the decision that the Tariff Commission has come to they have simply eliminated agriculture altogether.  As far as I can see they have allowed themselves to be mastered, to be more or less compelled to make a decision.  You have the London Midland and Scottish Railway Company theatening that they would increase the freight on live stock by one shilling per head and so forth if by any chance they lost the carriage of flour to this country through the operations of a tariff. 
     
     You have Jacob's who, I am sure, very insincerely, made certain statements. They said that they would have to change their business from the City of Dublin to Aintree, and consequently disemploy perhaps three thousand people in Dublin.  I wonder what the ultimate policy of Messrs. Jacob is, and I wonder if they think that it is not possible to develop a market in this country for their produce.  I wonder if they have at the back of their minds that at some date in the future they will decamp completely to Aintree, and then I suppose there might be regrets. I believe that Messrs. Jacob could, from the imposition of a tariff on flour, create a very big market for their products in this country.  The milling industry is important to an agricultural community, especially a community   that depends altogether on turning its produce into facts of various kinds&mdash;you have beef, butter, bacon, and so forth&mdash; and it seems strange, in such a country, a country of which this produce is the chief business, that there is no machinery for supplying food for animals, and that nearly all the food comes from foreign countries.  Anybody going to fairs and markets will at once come to one conclusion, that one-third of the animals seen in these fairs and markets are properly fed; the remainder are practically starving.  If we are consistent, if we believe that the agricultural industry is our fundamental industry, and that it should be carried along these lines, that it should create a factory to produce fats, I believe that that cannot be successfully carried on until we develop our local milling industry.  I know that the policy is to centralise that industry. 
     We are told that a mill along the water edge, a mill here in Dublin, is much more economic than one down the country.  That may be so in our present position, but I hope that it will not always remain so.  I hope that some definite steps will be taken whereby we can produce at least fifty per cent. of the bread we eat.  To-day I believe we produce one per cent.  It is an extraordinary state of things in a country that is mainly agricultural, that we should pay £7,000,000 a year to foreigners to grow food for us, that we never consider for a moment what might happen if a war occurred, if a huge strike occurred, or if any of those countries that produce wheat did not have harvests for a couple of years.  I wonder what our position would be then?  But to my mind the main point to be considered from the agricultural point of view is the proper feeding and rearing of livestock.  As long as offals cannot be got handily and cheaply, people cannot feed livestock as they ought to be fed.  Denmark's strong position is due to the cheapness of the food for the stock she rears.  I admit that she imports a large quantity of offal from England, but she has special machinery for doing it, and we have not: she is able to import it much cheaper than we are.  From the agricultural point of view, Denmark is not in the same   position as we are; she has not the same land; she has not the milling power, in the form of water, that we possess.  I believe that until we are in a position to develop our local milling industry so that the farmers can buy cheap offal at convenient centres, where millers and their sons could carry on their own mills, we will not be in a position to produce fats to compete in the markets of the world. 
     The general cry has always been &ldquo;the increased cost of living.&rdquo; The question of increasing the cost of living has become a sort of farce, and I do not think anybody believes a word of it. It is simply a catch-cry to deter innocent people.  It is insincere propaganda. It makes no difference at all to the agricultural community what the cost of living is, provided that they can sell what they produce at a reasonably economic price.  It comes down to the same old thing again: if you have not the money the cost of living does not matter at all.  The decision of the Tariff Commission, to my mind, is directly opposed to the agricultural position in Ireland.  It lends no hand and gives no assistance whatever to the development of our main industry. 
     The question of tariffs has been one of controversy, largely through propaganda. All the properly developed, economic countries in the world use tariffs.  Tariffs are more or less handicaps, to be used just as a handicapper handicaps a racehorse, the aim being as far as possible to give the younger or the weaker ones a chance.  The same applies in industry; the object of a tariff is to give industries that are about to start a chance to get their heads above water.  A tariff of 3s. might not have done any good.  The Tariff Commission does not seem to have arrived at any definite conclusion whatsoever regarding the cost of production in foreign countries.  They did mention so much a ton on wheat coming over from Birkenhead to Dublin.  I wonder what means they took to verify that, and I wonder what quantity of flour comes here practically as ballast. Certainly a good deal of wheat arrives in other countries practically as ballast, so that even with the 3s. imported wheat might still perhaps even be able to dominate the industry here. 
     
        On the question of the disemployment of three thousand people in Messrs. Jacob's&mdash;which would not take place&mdash;they never took into consideration the number of people who could be employed to the country in the milling industry and in the growing of wheat. There are three million people in the country.  A good proportion of these people could be profitably engaged in the production and milling of wheat, and a big proportion could be profitably engaged in feeding live stock with the offals. 
     As I said, this is a fundamental industry; it gives rise to many other industries; it gives rise to and assistance to an industry that I think all parties in this House are agreed about reviving and developing, the dairying industry.  It would give great assistance to our pig-rearing industry.  To-day we are competing with the United States of America, and in the general run of cases we are feeding to our pigs exactly the same food as they feed to them in the United States of America. Irish bacon made its name when we had mills all over Ireland.  It is not holding its name to-day, because pigs are not fed on the same materials as they were fed on in the old days. 
     As to the dead meat industry and the good price at present for early matured cattle, we could double our trade if we had the means of feeding those cattle in time.  The time that these cattle are really fattened is in winter, and that is the time when the Irish farmer has not the feeding stuffs to give them. The policy is good.  We are told that that is what we should aim at, but we are never given the means of aiming at or carrying out that policy.  As long as we have to depend on grass to produce beef we will not be in a position to compete in the British markets; we will never be in a position to take advantage of the time when prices are high.  We seem to be always left in the position of selling in the months when markets are glutted.  One reason for that is because we have not material at hand to feed.  People who fatten cattle are compelled to buy half-starved stores.  In any average fair in any part of the country one finds it difficult to get one well-fed beast out of every three or four.  As I say, it comes   back again to the one point&mdash;the point of the milling industry and encouragement to grow sufficient foodstuffs for these animals.  I hope that some definite steps will be taken by the House to ensure that that industry will get support and get a fair chance to revive. 
     
      
       I think the answer which the President gave to-day, and upon which the debate is proceeding, has not been fully understood.  The President stated, in reply to a question put by Deputy de Valera: 
       The Executive Council have considered the Report of the Tariff Commission and have decided to accept their recommendation that the application for a tariff on flour should not be granted. 
       But there were other matters mentioned in the Report, and the President went on to say that these were under consideration.  That referred to one matter, to what is in the Minority Report sent in by Professor Whelehan. There are a variety of other matters which emerge on the Report apart from the actual application with regard to the imposition of a Customs duty of a certain amount per sack of imported flour.  It is very difficult to argue on this point with people who do not understand even the terms of the President's reply, when the sort of argument put up was what Deputy O'Reilly has just uttered when he talked about the cost of living as being a mere farce, mere propaganda, merely a catch-cry, and that we may neglect that entirely in our considerations.  If I entirely neglect in my consideration any reaction in the cost of living arising from this tariff, then I am in favour of the tariff.  I do not care how little employment is going to be given, or how big the indirect employment that is going to be given.  The smallness of the direct employment is a small matter in comparision with the preservation of a certain number of mills in this country, be they efficient or inefficient, if there is going to be no reaction in the cost of living. 
     
     The Tariff Commission has definitely recommended against the granting of   the Customs duty required for two reasons.  The main reason is because of the effect upon the cost of living.  They phrase that in this way&mdash;the costs of production in Irish mills are greater than the price at which the imported flour can be bought.  Again, how is one going to argue against the statement of Deputy de Valera, that it is quite easy to prove that the decrease in the price of offals would balance the increase in the price of flour?  Apparently Deputy de Valera believes that there is some argument in the cost of living being increased, and hopes he can disprove it by showing a balance by decreasing one thing and increasing another.  What argument have we to meet?  It would be easy to show&mdash; Deputy de Valera says&mdash;that the decrease in the price of offals would balance whatever increase there might be in the price of flour.  Why was that not demonstrated?  There was simply the statement that it would be easy to show.  Again, Deputy de Valera says: &ldquo;Conditions which amount to dumping prevail with regard to the importation of flour into this country.&rdquo; If there are conditions in which amount to dumping, it should have been possible for the applicants for the tariff to prove that fact before the Commission. The Tariff Commission say that certain allegations were made and that, in fact, on examination the applicants were not able to substantiate the allegations they had made.  Deputy de Valera believes that there are conditions which amount to dumping.  Again we should have some demonstration of the fact, some attention to detail when we are considering what Deputy de Valera believes to be the disappearance of an industry.  Again the point is made simply in a statement&mdash;I think his phrase was that the industry will disappear is clear to anybody who will read the Report.  I have read the Report and the Tariff Commissioners' deliberate statement, that although some mills may disappear the industry is not threatened with extinction.  They balance that by stating that in their view a certain number of mills would disappear if a tariff were imposed.  So that between the two, the non-imposition of a tariff and the imposition of   it, as far as the Commissioners are concerned, they put their signatures to the statement that the industry is not threatened with extinction.  Deputy de Valera believes otherwise and asks us to accept his word with regard to it. 
     We have had this dealt with from two or three points of view by Deputy de Valera.  The question of war came very much before&mdash;us while he was speaking, and in that connection we are asked&mdash;is it the Executive Council's policy that this country should be dependent for food on a foreign country in case of war?  Food is the term &mdash;not wheat, not flour, but food.  Does anybody believe that if there was a war around our coasts, and we could not get flour or wheat in, we are going to be dependent for food upon a foreign country?  Will anybody consider just what the economy of this State is, and say if, in the event of our coasts being blockaded for a short period, we would have either a scarcity of food or too much food in the country, and relate that to the tariff on flour, which is the precise item we are discussing?  Let him go further, and consider the war question, and ask if we are going to consider our situation in the event of war, and in the event of our coasts being blockaded and all supplies being cut off, is the first essential we should look to wheat or flour?  Is there anything else that should come before us?  We will take stock of those commodities that would be considered essential in war, those commodities which the country cannot supply, and are we going to pay a heavy rate of insurance over a possibly long period of years, preparing against a contingency which is very remote, and circumstances which need not necessarily arise when the remote contingency comes about?  If people think that is the way to meet that situation, which may be very near, but which we hope is very far off, then let us have a war programme for peace times with regard to the cultivation of those essential industries, and let us see what it is going to cost the country. But do not let us have talk that, because war may come along, this country is going to be dependent for food supplies upon a foreign country. 
     
        That is the war side of the question. There are two other sides referred to that I would like to dispose of quickly.  The name of Messrs. Jacob has been thrown around in the discussion here.  I interrupted Deputy de Valera to make what I thought was a correction in what he said.  I understand that various propositions were put before the Tariff Commission by the applicants, who very definitely had before them the serious trouble that might be caused to a firm of the size and importance of Messrs. Jacob's when they did consider ways and means.  Eventually one of the firm, on being examined before the Commission, gave evidence, and said that he believed that the only possible way in which they could be met was by the simple plan that they should be allowed to import free of duty any flour they required.  Mr. Jacob followed up that statement with this remark&mdash;I quote from the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; report of the evidence on the 4th June:&mdash;&ldquo;He could not, however, see how the country could arrange for the unrestricted supply of flour to one firm while other firms had to pay duty.&rdquo; On that the Tariff Commission made the remark quoted.  The Chairman of the Commission did not go out of his way on his own to turn down any plan. 
     Let us end Messrs. Jacob's situation simply by the statement I made myself in the previous debate.  A statement afterwards of a somewhat similar nature was made by the Minister for Finance to the applicants for this tariff, namely, that if Messrs. Jacob were the only obstacle to granting the tariff there was a distinct way out of the difficulty.  I said myself in a debate in November that I could not conceive how it was impossible to arrange that they should get in their supplies as they liked.  The Minister for Finance made a similar statement to the applicants for the tariff afterwards. If the only obstacle to the granting of the tariff were a reaction upon the firm of Messrs. Jacob I believe Jacobs could be met quite reasonably, that there is a way easy enough, even if it had to go to the extent Mr. Jacob put in evidence, following it with the remark that he   could not see how it could be done.  It can be done if nothing else can be done. 
     There was a further point made by Deputy O'Reilly with regard to the objection made to the grant of the tariff by the shipowners.  The Tariff Commissioners themselves say with regard to that objection: &ldquo;We take the view that the fears of the shipping companies as to loss of business if a tariff is imposed on flour are somewhat exaggerated,&rdquo; and they go on to say: &ldquo;moreover, their argument if carried to its logical conclusion would deny the utility of developing manufacture in this country of any imported article in common use and heretofore forming a substantial part of the cargoes of cross-Channel steamers.&rdquo; So that the Tariff Commissioners were not swayed by the evidence put before them by the shipping companies, and so far as the shipping companies are concerned that argument may be left out of count.  So far as Jacobs are concerned, I think the situation will require very careful handling, but it is not an impediment to the granting of the tariff.  What is the impediment?  The impediment is referred to on page 24, paragraph 38, of the Report:&mdash; 
     &ldquo;The main difficulty which has confronted us in dealing with this application and has prevented us from recommending in its favour is the smallness in the increase in the number of persons likely to be employed in consequence of a tariff, together with our disbelief that the additional output secured by a tariff to the Saorstat mills would enable them to reduce their costs of production sufficiently to prevent a rise in the price of bread.&rdquo; That is the net point and if the applicants for a tariff can show us even now that the grant of this tariff is not going to increase the price of bread then the biggest impediment, and to my mind the only impediment, to the granting of the tariff has been removed. Whether the employment to be granted is big or small relatively to what other industries might give if there is going to be any increase in the price of bread then, although certain things would have to be looked for, there is no other valid, good objection to the granting of a tariff. 
     
        I refer to other things.  The Tariff Commissioners were asked to report upon the efficiency of the mills and upon certain labour conditions.  Labour does not enter very much into its consideration. It has been pointed out with regard to costs that wages here do not vary very much as opposed to the competitive firms on the other side.  But will people read what is to be found on page 9 of the Report with regard to the non-use of certain appliances on the quays of Dublin and ask are they going to protect that type of thing, where boats laden with grain are not allowed to come alongside where certain machinery has been erected for unloading the grain by suction, and where the practice is for these vessels to berth somewhere else where the grain has to be transferred to barges by manual labour, the barges being subsequently allowed to come alongside and unload by means of the suction plant.  Then everything goes well.  Is that kind of thing to be protected?  Is that kind of thing going to be allowed to continue?  Are you going to allow that state of things that has existed along the docks to continue and strengthen, supposing the result of the tariff is to strengthen it? 
     On page 9 we have a report as to the efficiency of the individual mills.  Now these mills are in the country at the moment, and they are a valuable asset. But one does not want to emphasise too much anything said with regard to their efficiency.  If it was going to mean simply that millers were going to remain content with the mills described here, one would hesitate to speak about the matter at all, because obviously they are not to be stirred into any kind of action for the improvement of their mills.  If they are not going to be stirred into action for the improvement of their mills by this Report, then obviously to talk about the efficiency of the mills at all is going to do harm. The Tariff Commissioners have been rather careful to say that some of the conditions operating against the mills are not local, but due to general outside world conditions.  They do advert to certain local considerations on page 9 &ldquo;the lack of real modern plant, and small size, and that, in view of the present circumstances of the industry,   some of them can hardly be regarded as economic units.&rdquo; As long as these conditions remain one must see immediately that the statement that the Tariff Commissioners make, later on, remains accurate until disproved, and the evidence will have to be very strong to disprove it, namely, the cost of production in these circumstances must be higher than in mills of a more efficient type.  Are the mills simply going to fold their arms and say, &ldquo;Our application has been rejected; we will do no more, we are finished.  We are through with the whole business&rdquo;?  If they do, there are two ways of meeting them. There may be a better type of miller coming along afterwards, or one will simply say, &ldquo;Very well, we cannot depend upon you; your costs of production are not only high now but are going to remain high.&rdquo; 
     Should this Report be taken as the end of everything?  I hope not.  That Report, as a matter of fact, says that under certain conditions, which are referred to, with regard to the size of the mill, the modern plant, that the protection of that is going to be protection of a certain type of inefficiency, and that protection of inefficiency is going to react harshly upon the consumer of bread&mdash;and everybody eats bread.  If the type of the mill, its size, location and plant is the thing that is hampering this application, there is a means provided whereby these people can get State assistance, to locate themselves elsewhere, to get better plant, to get their mills made of a more economic size under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.  I would hope to see that the mills will take that to heart, and come along and seek assistance in getting the mills into a better state of things.  And if the mills are put into such a state the costs of production are not going to the any higher than the cost of the imported article, and there is a radical change in the view towards this tariff. When one talks of the possible increase in the cost of living arising from this &mdash;although it is not actually before us in the Tariff Report&mdash;I do not see that one can completely get away from certain evidence produced before the Tribunal on Prices and certain matters detailed there. 
     There is a certain similarity between   the two reports.  There are certain things in the way of evidence common to both.  We are told, for instance, that the yield of loaves per sack of flour in Ireland is about 89.  The Prices Tribunal investigated that point, and made the discovery that in England the run of loaves to the sack is something between 92 and 97&mdash;it is certainly nearer 94 than 89 here.  They find, further, that with the run of work in the bakeries in Dublin that they would handle 13 sacks&mdash;I think it was put by one witness at 141⁄4&mdash;as opposed to the North of Ireland's 24. 
     I will get the exact figures in a moment.  In the baking trade, also, you get, as an explanation of the difference in output here, the fact that there are only certain firms in Dublin and, I think, in Cork, who have machinery&mdash;ovens of the modern type.  I think that was relied upon by certain people who appeared for the operatives as an explanation of the difference.  In addition to that you get the further point, which is where I come back to the Tariff Commission Report, that there are two types of bread ordinarily in demand here. There is a variety of classes of bread, but they are divided for the purpose of the report of the Prices Tribunal into batch bread and turn-over bread.  We had it given very definitely before the Prices Tribunal in evidence that the demand here is for the better type of bread, that that demand is universal, that that is a type of bread demanding more labour and obviously requiring that a certain amount of additional time shall be spent upon it.  Consequently the output is less.  Coming to the Tariff Commission Report, one of the reasons which they give as indicating the difference in cost here and on the other side is that the demand in this country is for a loaf made of a particular type of flour, ordinarily described as &ldquo;patent flour,&rdquo; whereas in England&mdash;even in London&mdash;the demand is by no means for the patent type of flour only, but for an admixture of what is known as Number 1 and Number 2 flours.  This country is, therefore, in the position that it is demanding a type of flour which, according to the report of the Tariff   Commission, I think means that they must get the cream of the wheat; that there are areas in England in which the flour made from the residue of the wheat can be disposed of, but that we are demanding, on this side, absolutely the finest quality of flour that can be had. 
     To go back to the matter that I passed over in order to get correct figures, it is stated in the report of the Prices Tribunal, page 26, that, according to individual master-bakers, the average output in Dublin is from 12 to 131⁄4 sacks, whereas in Belfast it is from 20 to 24 sacks per week.  Getting away from flour and coming to the final product, you find the situation that you have workers in this country in the bakery trade who are paid more even than the workers in Northern Ireland. 
     
      
       Are there similar conditions there? 
     
     
      
       This whole matter was stated by the Chairman of the Tribunal on Prices to be easily the most mixed matter he had to deal with. I ask people who are interested to read the evidence which is printed at the end of the Report of the Prices Tribunal. They say they were not convinced as to the evidence in respect to the difference in the amount of wages or the large difference in output.  As to flour, may I make my point here as regards the final cost to the consumer in the price of bread&mdash;that there has to be taken into consideration the higher wages paid in the Saorstat to the baking operatives, and that, secondly, you have to take into account that you get handled here an average of 131⁄4 sacks, as opposed to Belfast's 20 to 24 sacks.  Thirdly, there has to be taken into account&mdash;a small matter&mdash;the disappearance of night-baking here, and fourthly, you are having demanded by people in this country the finest type of flour that can be brought in.  When people talk about the difference in the cost of living, comparing the index figures, they should remember that possibly at times for the higher cost of bread there is being got bread of a higher quality. One should stop and ask first: &ldquo;Is this a quality of bread that this country can continue to purchase?&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Can it continue to have the conditions referred to in these reports prevail for any length of time?&rdquo; 
       I have had it stated to me with regard to another business that certain of the employees of the Shannon Scheme&mdash;certain of the foreign employees&mdash;find that when their wives go to look for meat in Limerick&mdash;meat of a particular type&mdash;they discover that it is almost given away to them.  They compare, then, to the disadvantage of this country the price at which they can get certain of the poorer ends of meat with the difficulty they have to get, and the prices they have to pay for the better ends of meat.  They know the explanation.  It is simply the same with regard to meat as with regard to bread&mdash;that there are certain demands made in this country for the best product.  It is a question again: are you going to try to change the taste of the people in meat and the taste of the people in respect of flour in this particular instance?  That is not a thing that any Tariff Commission can do.  And the question would have to be considered first: is it worth while doing; should one attack the public taste in such a matter?  Should one say&mdash;possibly it might be a help to millers at this moment&mdash;that one should prohibit the importation of anything except straight-run flour.  I do not know what benefit that would be to them; it might be of considerable benefit to them.  Should one stand up to the public clamour that will necessarily follow?  I know of an experiment made in this city by a baker on two occasions.  On the first occasion, he gave a mixture in his loaf similar to what was given in England of No. 1 and No. 2 flours.  About 30 per cent. of his customers left him on the ground that his bread had got bad.  Secondly, he made the experiment of applying the same number of gallons of water as they do in England.  He got dough of a lighter consistency, as in England, but he got a demand from one-third of his customers that his bread had better be looked to, that it was getting bad. 
     
     
      
       What did he do with the other one-third? 
     
     
     
      
       It was the same one-third that objected.  One finds, right through this whole tariff discussion, that there are things which have not been reported upon but which definitely arise out of the two reports which we have got before us&mdash;though not on the Tariff Commission Report alone.  It is a question: Will the millers get any benefit from reading this Report and making up their minds that, in altered circumstances, they can get a tariff if it is necessary to save an industry which ought to be saved not by reason of war conditions which may come on us hereafter, but by reason of the ordinary normal conditions of peace times?  Will they adjust themselves to the new conditions? Will they see that they are criticised, and criticised in a friendly way, by this Report and will they seek to get rid of whatever defects have been revealed in their machinery?  Meanwhile, is there anything that can be done?  I started off by saying that there are a variety of matters under consideration in connection with this Report.  Is there anything that can be done, for instance, in regard to the matter referred to in Professor Whelehan's addendum&mdash;a matter that, I think, should be discussed apart from this Report?  That arises under the Report and it is one of the matters that the Executive Council must take into consideration. Another question arises: Are Parties in this House agreed to launch a campaign against the use of patent flour in this country?  Are Parties in this House prepared to unite in a campaign against the use of flour-bread at all in this country? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       Only one Deputy has spoken. 
     
     
      
       But he is a doctor. 
     
     
      
       Are people prepared to relate the circumstances in this country to the circumstances of other countries lying between the same parallels of latitude that we are? Are they prepared to look at conditions and see what types of bread are used in this country and in other countries?  Are they prepared to try to   get the people of this country to realise the extravagant conditions they are living under at present and to induce them to change?  I think a national campaign on these lines would be a useful outcome of the Tariff Commission Report, but I doubt if we are going to get such a campaign started. 
     
     
      
       Introduce a Bill. 
     
     
      
       Meantime, without such a campaign, there is this to be asked of the millers, with which I end: Are they going to take this as the last word that is to be said with regard to the preservation of milling in this country?  If they are, then possibly the best thing to say to them would be, &ldquo;Get you gone; we will get others to take your places&mdash;others who will fit the new conditions better.&rdquo; I submit it is not the act of any reasonable man to take that Report as the last word on this subject.  There has been an examination of an industry.  There have been revealed certain defects.  It is up to those people whose deficiencies have been revealed to see if they can be remedied.  They will get State assistance &mdash; State assistance is open to them&mdash;with regard to the remedy.  One thing must be made clear before one interferes with such an essential matter as bread, and that is, that either immediately or in the near future the costs of production here are going to be as low as the costs of production in any other country that is competing with us in this matter of flour. 
     
     
      
       In the discussion on this application for a tariff I have an advantage over those from this side of the House who have already spoken in so far as we have had just now a fairly full revelation of the Ministerial attitude concerning it.  That revelation has been of such a nature as to give considerable ground for thought concerning the whole application.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has, just as effectively as Deputy de Valera did disposed of the majority of the arguments advanced by the Tariff Commission against the application. By disposing of these arguments he has succeeded in bringing into greater relief the one argument to   which he devoted the major part of his remarks, that is, that a tariff on flour might result in an increase in the price of bread to the people. 
     
     It should be remembered that that was not the main argument of the Tariff Commission.  The main difficulty which confronted them, as the Minister reminded us, was that the increase in employment resulting from the tariff would be small, and they coupled with that their disbelief that the additional output from the Saorstat mills secured by a tariff would enable them to reduce their costs of production sufficiently to prevent a rise in the price of bread. They said that one of the most formidable objections to a tariff lay in the situation which would be created for Messrs. Jacob.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, the number of additional workers that would be employed is a very minor matter. Although the Tariff Commission said that that was their main difficulty, the Minister was quick to realise that they were resting their case on a very weak argument, because as Deputy de Valera pointed out, this is a key industry, and an industry which every civilised Government in the world is attempting to foster within its shores, that it is an industry which has reaction throughout the economic life of our people, and the fact that only 150 extra workers would be employed as a result of a tariff does not affect the argument.  The fact remains that the industry is there and that there are some 1,700 people employed in it.  We want to keep the industry there, and to keep the people employed in it, and the fact also remains that no matter what a Minister may say to the contrary, the industry is declining.  Well-equipped and efficient mills are closing down, and have closed down, and as a result of the depression the skilled workers available are leaving the country.  The Minister may hold out hope to those engaged in the industry by telling them if they reorganise their business that they can come again with perhaps a better chance of success, and seek for the tariff which they have been refused on this occasion.  But it should be remembered that the prospects of bringing the industry up to the level of efficiency which we would like to see, are growing   daily smaller.  Not merely are those who have placed their capital in the industry being discouraged, but, as I pointed out already, those actually skilled in the industry are leaving the country.  The result will be that we shall have the present Minister or some future Minister telling us next time that the flour-millers are seeking a tariff that it is impossible to give to them, as it is now impossible to increase the protection given to the boot and shoe industry as skilled workers are not available. 
     The main argument that the Minister has relied on to support the Government's attitude in accepting the Report is that there might possibly be an increase in the price of bread as a result of the granting of the application. Now we have got to divide that argument into two parts: first, to discover if there will, in fact, be an increase in the price of bread, and, secondly, to discover if by refusing the application we will prevent an increase in the price of bread.  The flour millers, in their evidence before the Commission, stated that there would possibly be an increase in the price of flour by a maximum figure of 1/9 per sack.  In their original detailed case the applicants calculated an addition of 1/9 per sack to the price of flour would be required to yield them a profit that they considered reasonable.  They subsequently reconsidered their case and submitted another estimate on which they claimed that the increase on a sack of flour would not exceed 1/3. This estimate allowed for a fall of £1 per ton in the price of offals, the view of the applicants being that in the unlikely event of no such fall taking place an increase of threepence per sack would be sufficient.  We must bear in mind in considering this matter that the consumption per head of the population per year is something less than a sack of flour, and the estimated increase in the cost of flour as a result of the tariff varies from threepence per head of the population per year to 1/3 per head.  In this connection it is well to point out that there is no justification whatsoever for the assumption made by the Tariff Commissioners that the flour millers would take an unfair   advantage of the protection given to them for the purpose of increasing their profits.  The Commissioners say that the natural desire of the millers to make the best profits possible would result in an increase to almost the full extent of the duty, but gave no reason whatever for making that altogether unjustifiable assumption.  The cynical outlook they displayed in this connection indicates fairly clearly that they were making a report against the application on orders&mdash;that they were not allowing themselves to be influenced by the arguments placed before them, but were considering these only in the light of the best answers that could be given. 
     Although the flour millers were prepared to give an undertaking to the effect that: &ldquo;Our prices for flour in any place in An Saorstat will not exceed the prices of the day officially quoted in trade journals for similar flour of equal quality ex the mill in England plus ordinary transport charges between such English mill and such place in An Saorstat&rdquo;&mdash;although the flour millers were prepared to give that undertaking, and although they produced a considered case to show that the maximum increase in the price of flour would be only, at the most, 1/3 per sack the Tariff Commissioners turned down their arguments and said that their natural desire to make a profit would result in the price of flour being increased to the full extent of the duty.  It should be quite clear to any Deputies who have read the Report of the Food Prices Tribunal that an increase of 1/3 per sack in the price of flour would not involve an increase of a farthing in the price of a loaf of bread.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has made frequent reference to the Report of the Food Prices Tribunal, but he did not quote the most significant part of the Report, where the Tribunal declared that a fairly considerable alteration, an alteration of 3/9 per sack would have to occur before a similar fluctuation occurred in the price of bread. The Tribunal indicate, as a result of their investigations; that an increase of one farthing in the price of bread would not be justified unless flour went   up by 3/9 per sack.  In the towns of Galway and Sligo, they declared that a similar increase in the circumstances prevailing there would not be justified unless the price of flour increased by 8/- per sack.  We should also bear in mind that the Food Prices Tribunal carried out elaborate investigations and reported that in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Sligo, Dundalk, Waterford and Kilkenny, in fact in every town visited by them, except Limerick, they found the price of bread in excess of what it should be in comparison to the price of flour.  They produce a graph in their Report which indicates that, throughout the entire year of 1926, the level of bread prices was in excess of the level of flour prices, in some months by 4/1 in the price of the sack of flour, and on an average by about 3/- in the sack of flour.  If the same conditions prevail at present, we have no evidence whether they do or not, but even if the flour millers had to pay an extra 3/- for the sack of flour, instead of being justified in increasing the price of bread they would be only selling bread at what would be a just price. 
     You have the fact that this Dail solemnly set up a Food Prices Tribunal which carried out elaborate investigations and submitted a Report to this House.  In that Report they make very definite statements concerning the price of bread.  When the fate of an important industry is concerned, and when statements made by interested parties are quoted, the report of that tribunal is disregarded, and we take it for granted that an increase of 1s. 3d. in the sack of flour is going to be passed on to the consumer by an increase of one farthing in the 2lb. loaf.  If the bakers in this country did endeavour to compensate themselves for an increase of 1s. 3d. in the price of the sack of flour by increasing the price of bread, they would be profiteering, and it would be up to this Dail to take effective steps to bring them to sell their bread at a proper price.  I would like the Dail to take that fact into consideration if, as is possible, a motion should be introduced in this House concerning this matter, that an increase in the price of the sack of flour which the flour millers expect might result from a   tariff on the product would not exceed 1s. 3d. per sack, and that an increase of 3s. 9d. in the sack of flour would have to take place before the bakers would be justified in increasing the price of their bread by one farthing per loaf. 
     There is no justification whatever for the assumption that even with the flour mills in their present state of efficiency a tariff would result in an increase in the cost of bread to the consumers.  The Food Prices Tribunal made the statement that I have quoted as a result of very elaborate investigations, and supported that with a great volume of evidence.  If they are wrong and the statements which have been made in the Press concerning this matter are correct, then we should be informed of the fact and we should have evidence produced with the object of endeavouring to convince us that the Food Prices Tribunal did not bring in a true Report. Until that Report has been challenged and the statements in it controverted we must accept it, and if we accept it we must come to the conclusion that the granting of a tariff on flour will not result in an increase in the price of bread. 
     The other question then arises: Do we avoid a possible increase in the price of bread by refusing the application for a tariff?  Remember it has been stated by the Commission &ldquo;that competition amongst the British millers for the existing market is of the keenest. Their trade journals are full of complaints as to price-cutting.  The applicants stated that the flour imported into the Saorstat is offered for sale at prices which can yield little or no profit to the manufacturers, and they claim that this is due to the price-cutting war that is carried on by cross-Channel millers amongst themselves, to their own loss and to the peculiar detriment of the Saorstat millers.&rdquo; 
     It appears that flour is being sold at certain prices in the Saorstat at present because there is a price-cutting war going on between certain groups of English millers.  What is going to happen when that war is over?  What are these conflicting groups fighting for? Why are they at present cutting their prices in order to eliminate each other?   What are to be the fruits of victory for the victor?  Is it not the intention of the conflicting parties to put their opponents out of business by sacrificing their profits now in order to reap the greater profit later on?  When the war is over and the victorious group emerges and proceeds to reap the fruits of victory in this country, it will be an easy matter for them, and then we will be faced with an increase probably of much more than 3s. per sack of flour. It should be borne in mind that the price of flour fluctuates during the course of any single year by amounts exceeding very often 3s. per sack. 
     An increase of 3s. per sack of flour is a very ordinary thing in the business. Similarly a decrease is an ordinary thing, but when this price-cutting war is over, and when a monopoly in the flour distributing trade in this country has been placed in the hands of one group of English millers, are we going to get the benefits of any fluctuations that may take place?  Rather are we not going to have monopoly prices in this country, and will we not be at the mercy of whatever the owners of these foreign mills may agree and decide upon?  We will, I assert, not merely not avoid a possible rise in prices by refusing the tariff, but we are going a good way towards making a rise in the price of bread almost inevitable.  We ought surely to have learned from our experience in the past, and from the figures made available in connection with the boot and shoe industry, that English factories, with a monopoly of the trade here, have not hesitated to charge monopoly prices, and to charge their customers here prices in excess of what they charge their customers in other parts of the world.  I suggest that the same thing is going to happen in the flour milling trade. 
     There are many matters in connection with this that one would like to refer to, but it would take too long to do so.  I would ask Deputies who have read the Report to refer particularly to the figures concerning the export of flour and offals to Denmark as compared with the export of flour and offals to this country.  I would ask them to remember that in this matter,   at any rate, we are England's biggest customer, and that 65 per cent. of her total exports of flour comes into Ireland. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has stated that there were many matters arising out of the Report still under consideration by the Government. It is difficult to see what these matters can be, considering that the main application has been refused. 
     I would be glad if some subsequent speaker on the Government side would indicate exactly what the Government has under consideration, or whether it is not just making arrangements for the funeral of the industry.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce also said that the costs of production in Irish mills are higher than the costs in English mills.  That statement should be considered in view of the fact that Irish mills are in the majority of cases working at half time, and as a result their costs are much higher than they would be in the case of mills working at full capacity.  If the Irish mills were working at full capacity it is very possible the cost of production here would not exceed the cost of production in the English mills, if the English mills lost 65 per cent. of their export trade, which represents their exports to this country.  We must remember the cost of production in English mills is lower because they have this export trade here; at any rate, that applies to the mills with which we are immediately concerned, the Mersey-side mills.  The cost of production is high because of the fact the English mills are exporting here that quantity of flour.  If Irish millers were given a chance to secure the full market in this country, I have no doubt whatever that the intense competition which in a very short time would develop amongst themselves would result in a very considerable increase in the efficiency of their machinery. 
     I do not admit that the Tariff Commission's Report on the efficiency of these mills can be given very serious weight.  They have visited only two mills, and they cannot speak with authority concerning the flour-milling industry in this country.  If they had visited the main mills and secured reliable data concerning them, then we could pay   some attention to their remarks on this matter, but we cannot expect that the members of the Commission who visited two mills had become overnight an authority on the milling industry. The Minister for Industry and Commerce considers the situation that would be created in this country in the event of the English corn supplies being restricted would not be serious.  Of course, he says, if there was a blockade there would be too much instead of too little food in the country.  We could live on beef and potatoes.  We would not, I suppose, have even Jacob's biscuits in that event, but we would have the beet sugar. 
     
      
       What about oats? 
     
     
      
       I do not know.  Did you ever try them?  The point is, I think it is a very short-sighted view to take of a serious matter.  We want to try and make this country as self-contained as possible.  If we are to make the country self-contained, we must endeavour to ensure production within the country of as many of the prime necessities of life as possible. One of these is bread.  We should endeavour to ensure that not merely will wheat be produced, but that it will be made into bread in this country, for in the event of another great war breaking out, and it is not impossible, despite the League of Nations and the trappings around it, that war may come again, England is going to take good care that any wheat supplies she can secure will be utilised to feed her own population first, and no one could blame her for that.  We will be then in the position that we will have to depend on the surplus that England cares to send over here. 
     
     I would like to say a few words in connection with the serious question of Messrs. Jacob's.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce had, of course, disarmed criticism of the Report in that connection by his statement that it is not beyond the wit of man or beyond the wit of his Government to devise some means by which the difficulty created by the position could be overcome.  Of course, it could be overcome.   It is well that certain false statements made in this connection should be put right.  Messrs. Jacob say that the directors of their English factory are constantly pressing them to transfer the bulk of their business to Aintree, because they can make larger profits there.  It should be made clear that statement is made without any reference to the application for a tariff on flour.  They claim that they can make larger profits in England as a result of the more efficient machinery they have installed in their factory there, and that statement is made without any reference to the tariff on flour.  The Dublin directors stated they are maintaining the business in Dublin really in consequence of their sentimental attachment to the city, but that every economic force is driving them towards England. 
     There is no one who knows the extent of the efficiency of Messrs. Jacob's industry who does not appreciate very highly the efforts the Dublin directors have made to retain the bulk of their export business in this country, even against the very strong arguments that could be advanced in favour of transferring across the water.  It should be clearly understood that their objection to any further restrictions being imposed on them was not that these restrictions would by themselves drive their business out of the country, but would merely accentuate the process which seems to be already in progress.  No such difficulty would arise if the Government tackled this problem in the right spirit.  We have already granted Messrs. Jacob a licence for the import, free of duty, of spirit varnish, which they were unable to get in this country, to meet their requirements.  Similar machinery could be set up to enable them to import what flour they require in their manufacturing business, and we would be able to maintain not merely the essential flour-milling industry, but Jacob's industry as well.  In any case we must remember we want the flour-milling industry, and a responsible Dail and a responsible Government should take every step to ensure that it will be fostered. 
     
        By refusing to grant a tariff to the flour-milling industry we have neither ensured there will be no rise in price nor that Jacob's will stay.  I would like to make it clear that you do not provide against these evils by refusing a tariff, but you can do so while at the same time granting a tariff.  I think that the Report of the Tariff Commission in this respect can be disregarded. The speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot.  It is certainly a much more sensible contribution than the Report made by the Tariff Commission.  I am convinced, if the right spirit animated the Government, if they were working on a sound national policy, they would not have hesitated a moment when the application for a tariff on flour came before them.  They would have realised that a tariff would mean the preservation of the milling industry, and would have granted the industry the protection required.  They would have gone on that policy in the national interest irrespective of what minor consequences might come from it. 
     
      
       I am speaking on this subject to-night because I have been detailed.  I would wish for many reasons to have waited; whatever I hope what I have to say may lack in preparation, it may gain in frankness.  There is probably no subject on which it is more necessary to have frankness than the one we are discussing. 
     
     The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the whole of whose speech I regret I did not hear because I had to go out on certain duties in connection with this debate, was, when I came back, challenging not merely this House, but all the people of the country, to say whether they were prepared in certain particulars to do the thing that was the necessary preliminary to the thing they wanted accomplished.  For myself I say that, so far as I have any power to advocate it among all men in this country, I am prepared to do anything and everything necessary to carry out the basic object which we have in view.  I have to face a country in which there is emigration of the best, in which we breed from the worst.  Oh, yes.  If you   knew the scientific sorting and sifting by which the very best material of your country is sorted out in the ports to produce wealth in other countries, you would know that no country could stand the sifting out of the very best with the efficiency with which it has been sifted out, and the leaving behind that which is left behind.  I am faced with a country in which housing is a disgrace, and in which people are living under conditions which in many cases are disgraceful.  I am coming directly to the point.  The price of straight-run flour, if that is the only price that has to be paid for it, is a price which will be very freely paid in order to stop these much more basic and serious evils. 
     I accept unhesitatingly the doctrine that we are in relation to many things in our private lives deliberately choosing a standard of comfort which is interfering with our capacity to maintain a large population in this country on a widely distributed standard of frugal comfort.  Whether it is straight-run flour or whether it is any of these other fancy commodities, which we aspire to at present, whether they are social or economic, I am prepared to sacrifice the whole of them to build up in this country a large, healthy population, living under human, healthy conditions under a widely distributed standard of comfort.  That is the answer I give to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Under the actual terms of the Tariff Commission no national solution of the question of a tariff on flour could have been attempted. Up to that point it is no fault of the Commission.  If anyone will read through the ten headings under which they are to report, he must admit that the Tariff Commission had no right under any one of these heads to report upon the national advantage or disadvantage of a tariff.  That is an amazing statement to make, but I challenge anyone to read the paragraphs one by one and find a paragraph under which you can say to yourself: &ldquo;This is a question to be decided on profit or loss whether it is better or worse for the country.&rdquo; All that these people are limited to are narrow points of figures and accounts. 
     
     
      
       I think the Deputy is out of order when he tries to deal at this stage with the personnel of the Tariff Commission or the terms of reference.  The Deputy should deal with the Report. 
     
     
      
       I have no intention of making, nor did I make, any reference to the personnel of the Commission. 
     
     
      
       Or its terms of reference? 
     
     
      
       The difficulty is to explain why they have come to this conclusion; in their terms of reference it was difficult for them to do otherwise.  The only ground on which they could discuss the basic issue that lies behind this, namely, agricultural production in this country as the result of the development of the flour industry, is contained in paragraph 4.  They are asked to report the effect which the granting in whole or in part of the concessions asked for in the application would be likely to have on other trades and industries in the Saorstat.  Under that they never adverted to the existence of the agricultural industry as such.  I mean so far as they are concerned with the question of wheat production. Let us take that and assume that they had adverted to it.  I say frankly that they would have to drag it in there, as all the other terms of reference are of such a character that they are confined to purely financial matters. 
       Assume that they had to report as to what the effects of granting the concessions asked for would be on the industry of agriculture in this country. There is a modern convention in relation to tariffs that tariffs on industry are desirable in proportion to the labour content of the material which is imported.  Broadly speaking, there is no case for a tariff on raw material as a rule.  Take material which has very little labour in it.  There is very little case, as a rule, for the imposition of tariffs upon this, especially in a country where one's whole purpose is to provide maintenance for men.  In this country the test by which every one of our industries has to be tested is the number of people we can maintain upon a given standard of comfort. 
     
     
     
      
       The Deputy has been speaking for ten minutes and has not made any reference to the Report of the Tariff Commission in regard to flour.  The Deputy is dealing with tariffs generally. 
     
     
      
       You will excuse me.  I have here the Report of the Tariff Commission in regard to the application for a tariff on flour and it is from that that I have been reading. 
     
     
      
       The Deputy has been speaking for ten minutes, and for most of that time he has been speaking on the general question of tariffs, but not on the tariff under consideration. 
     
     
      
       I am pretty anxious to keep in order.  I am referring to paragraph 4 of this Report, page 26.  The Tariff Commission have reported on one of the headings under which they are bound to report, and they did not consider under that the raising of wheat at all.  The point I am getting at is that a flour tariff, judged purely and simply on the modern standards of test, is not a suitable tariff for a test by that standard. 
     
     The percentage of labour content is not high, but the difference which would be made is distinctly higher than the figure 133, which is given as the increase in employment.  I calculate on the basis of the average employment of those engaged in the industry at present, under figures given by them, that the real relative increase of employment is 600 men, on the same standard of employment which now exists, and which is the standard taken by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in saying that 10,000 persons more are being employed this year than last year.  We are up against a very critical case, because you cannot, on that very basis, make a big case for milling.  The biggest case you can put up for the flour-milling industry is that under a tariff system with a completely organised milling trade, we would manufacture the raw material of that industry here instead of importing it.  The raw material of that industry is wheat.  It is an ancillary industry, and this tariff has a related consequence in the development of a   very much bigger industry, an industry with an enormously greater capacity for employment than that upon which the case for the mills rests. 
     The second portion of the case was not considered by the Tariff Commission. Speaking frankly, I do not consider, at any rate, that they could have stated it in specific language.  Yet it is a case which, in my opinion, is the most powerful of all cases in relation to this question.  I would state the case for a tariff exactly as I would state the case for no income tax.  I would take a particular industry and its turn-over.  I would find the total amount that that industry distributed in wages, the rents paid, the rates and taxes paid, and the total of every sort and kind which the carrying on of that industry distributed in the State.  If you take the milling industry, and, quite apart from the question of wages, add up all these charges and put those against the empirical or possible increase in the cost of flour, you will find that there is a balance, but you will find it is not the unredressed balance which the Report suggests.  The Report suggests you have the complete cost thrown on the community.  The answer is, you have not.  I have no particular love for the word &ldquo;tariff.&rdquo; If by any means, bonus, public opinion or any other arrangement you like, you contrive to keep that industry milling the whole of the flour now consumed in Ireland, you will develop a whole lot of other things.  You have it that the wheat required, if we were to mill the whole lot, would be about 500,000 tons.  We find that at the present moment about three per cent. of the flour that is consumed in Ireland represented by wheat grown in this country.  If all that is used for milling, for feeding cattle and other purposes, is considered, there is not three per cent. of the necessary wheat available. It is a question of building up on that basis.  You can say, &ldquo;All right, let us wait until we build that up.&rdquo; but you will never be able to build up a wheat industry unless you have something to consume it.  If you allow your opportunity to pass now, your mills, which are dying, will soon   be dead, and you will not have that milling organisation available to tackle the wheat when it is required. 
     There is one matter which, personally, I am very glad to hear, and that is that the difficulty which was suggested in relation to Messrs. Jacob may be resolved by mutual consent, that it is a matter in which we do recognise a technical difficulty and that it does not represent any non possumus on either side.  The evidence given by Mr. Jacob &mdash;I had not his actual words before here, but I am using a quotation now&mdash; were on the 3rd June, 1927: &ldquo;If we were allowed to import for the manufacture of biscuits all the English flour we require without restriction, of course we would have no grievance and all our difficulties would be wiped away.&rdquo; These are Mr. Jacob's own words.  &ldquo;I cannot very well see how the country can arrange for an unrestricted supply of flour to a firm for a specific purpose.&rdquo; The Chairman of the Commission interrupted: &ldquo;It would be quite impossible.&rdquo; What I understand now is common ground is that if on other grounds it is desirable, the granting or the non-granting of a tariff on flour will not be held up simply on that ground and that some machinery will be provided to do that.  I think that is common ground.  If it is, an immense difficulty is out of the way.  Personally, I would prefer what has been suggested now had been suggested before the tariff had been turned down and the Report adopted. 
     It is suggested that some other alternative means should be adopted.  I am not saying whether or not we ought to look for alternative means.  There are people upon this side of the House and there are an enormous number of people in the country who are firmly convinced that the tariff is the only method, but as far as I am concerned, I am not concerned by what method it is done so long as it is done.  If you were to take an entirely different line, if you were to say that instead of merely fiscal methods you would use a very different expedient, if you were simply to say that no flour should be sold in Ireland which does not contain a certain percentage of Irish wheat&mdash; the percentage which is possible at the   moment is only three&mdash;it might very rapidly be raised to 10 or 15 per cent. There are no technical difficulties.  I speak under advice from those with greater knowledge than I possess myself. I am fortunately in the position of being able to get that technical knowledge and information from others.  There is no technical difficulty in absorbing in Irish milling and in using for Irish bread a percentage of Irish wheat altogether greater than we have any likelihood of immediately producing. 
     If we were to take that line, see what would happen?  Your English miller would either have to buy the wheat here, bring it over and mill it into flour on the other side, or he would have to come over here and mill Irish wheat with Manitoba or something else, or our mills, owned by ourselves, would have to use our Irish wheat with whatever other wheat we might import.  Now you have three possible ways, but you have no way of preventing the basic purpose of a tariff on flour being attained.  In 1947 there was as much wheat&mdash;I beg your pardon, I am afraid I am looking forward.  In 1847 there was as much wheat produced in Ireland as would be necessary for that purpose; I mean, for our whole milling now.  That is the information which I am given, but that much wheat is not available now. 
     The basic purpose of an Irish flour tariff is to develop the growing of wheat.  If the millers come to this House with the statement that they are prepared to use all the Irish wheat we give them, and if they are prepared to make those necessary combinations, those necessary reorganisations of their own trade, those necessary co-operations amongst themselves which do not exist always except when a tariff is required, they will come with a case which is overwhelming, and a case which this House ought not and, in my opinion, in honesty could not, refuse.  They can put a better case even than the case they have put, and the case they put is a good enough case, but there is behind it a very much greater and a very much better industry than their own to be developed as a result of their making it.  I would say, put first upon your   millers the definite obligation to use a certain quantity, and in every year an increasing quantity, of Irish wheat, and in so doing you will build the milling industry itself, and you will also build up an industry which is self-contained here. 
     There is one other point to which I want to allude, and that is the one taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in which he spoke very highly of what you might call straight-run flour bread.  The extraordinary part of it is that in a pamphlet I have here, which is entirely in favour of tariffs, that is the strongest point that is stressed.  There is no food value content in first-class flour which makes it superior to the straight-run flour.  There is appearance, but there is nothing got whatever from the point of view of nutriment. If you take a sack of Manitoba flour you can make 95 loaves out of it.  I can give you the actual figures of weight, at any rate.  You can get 380 lbs. of bread out of it.  If you take 280 lbs. of Irish flour you can get 340 lbs. of bread out of it&mdash;I am taking only average figures&mdash;but you are not getting any more flour; you are getting 40 lbs. more water.  The reason that it is capable of making that much more bread is due to its chemical constituents, and so on&mdash;it has a greater capacity to absorb and retain moisture.  If we get straight-run flour in this country we get better bread than is being got in London at the present moment.  Cork bread is superior to London bread to-day, and our bread would be superior when we get on to straight-run flour. 
     
      
       Cork bread is the best. 
     
     
      
       Cork bread is always perfect&mdash;not perfect in one respect: it is not perfect in the respect that you can buy for 71⁄2d. in one place in Cork what you will be charged 101⁄2d. for elsewhere in the same city. 
     
     
      
       The price is reduced in Dublin, I believe. 
     
     
      
       It is time.  I suggest deliberately to the millers that they take responsibility for the standard price of bread and, through their combination, they should see that   their industry is properly carried on and they should express the efficient carrying on of it in the price at which bread of good quality reaches the consumer. 
     
     
      
       What about the baker? 
     
     
      
       If there is anything standing in the way, if there is any combination of master bakers to keep up prices and to interfere with the advantage of the tariff going to the consumer, it is the business of the millers to come together and see that that blot upon the trade is taken away.  I am giving, deliberately, an invitation to the millers to look into this whole question again.  We are not satisfied to have this Report turned down, but neither am I satisfied that the millers have put the best case they could put, the best case founded on the complete co-operation of their industry as a unit, founded upon the determination of the organisation to use and encourage the use of home-made raw material, founded upon the determination to see that, from the wheat right through to the consumer of the bread, the very best value out of that tariff is given to the community in return for the privilege that the community gives to them. 
     
     
      
       Might I make quite clear this question about Jacob's?  I stated to a deputation of the applicants a considerable time ago that while to meet the difficulty suggested by Jacob's it might be necessary to give them a concession which was unusual, a concession which was quite exceptional, the matter presented no difficulty whatever, except making up our minds to give them exceptional treatment. As far as that is concerned, I do not regard the Jacob difficulty as any objection to a tariff.  It can be fully met, and if we felt for other reasons that a tariff was desirable it could easily be met. 
     
     The Deputy who has just spoken talked a good deal about the effect of a tariff&mdash;the tariff asked for&mdash;on agriculture. It seems to me the tariff asked for would have no effect on agriculture. I do not believe if we gave a tariff of 3/- a sack to the millers there would be any more wheat grown in   the Saorstat, and I do not believe that the inland mills about which Deputy de Valera was concerned would be assisted by the tariff.  In my opinion, if a tariff were imposed, the effect would be to enable the mills that are favourably situated to make greater profits.  At present we eat practically entirely bread made from imported wheat.  We must continue to do that, even assuming that we could immediately stimulate the growth of wheat. We must still for a considerable time eat bread almost entirely made out of imported wheat.  The mills which are situated at the ports, the mills which can directly take the grain from ocean-going vessels, have an advantage over other mills.  An occasional country mill may, because of certain circumstances, be able to compete, but the general position is that the mills situated at the ports have an advantage. If a tariff were imposed on flour, the result would be that the mills at the port would extend; probably new mills would be erected at the ports, and the competition of these favourably situated mills, either existing mills with extensions or existing mills and new mills, would be to drive these inland mills about which Deputy de Valera is concerned only more speedily out of existence. 
     A different sort of application would have to be considered if we were to have the question of wheat-growing fully examined by the Tariff Commission. I do not think they could have examined it fully, except an application for a tariff both on wheat and flour had been before them, and the two matters, with all their relations, could have been examined.  I do not think, however, that there is any danger this milling industry is going to be extinguished.  Undoubtedly a well-situated mill, a modern mill in the Saorstat, enjoys a natural protection. Wheat can be brought as cheaply to that mill as to the competing mill at the other side of the Channel, and whatever the cost of having flour brought from the other side of the Channel to the Saorstat, there is at least that amount of protection for the Saorstat mill. 
     However, the Commission points out that in one respect even the most   favourably-situated Saorstat mills labour under a disadvantage, and that is, for the bread the people want here patent flour must be used.  The miller on the other side of the Channel can send his patent flour here, and can get a market for the lower grades of flour in the industrial centres of England. The Irish miller can hardly make patent flour, because if he does, he has no market readily available for the lower grades of flour, and it is pointed out by the Commissioners in page 17 of the Report that Saorstat millers who are also bakers have to import patent flour, and thereby curtail the output of their own mills for that reason. The manufacture of patent flour seems to be practically impossible here owing to the lack of a market for the lower grades.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the question of preventing the importation of any but straight-run flour.  I must say that that is a suggestion which appeals to me very much.  It is a sort of matter that could only be dealt with if there were general agreement.  A further point&mdash;there is nothing the public resent so much as some interference with their food.  Deputies will all remember during the European War what grumbling there was about food.  Now, bread made from straight-run flour seems to be fully as wholesome as bread made from patent flour, which is at present consumed.  If none but straight-run flour could be imported, then we would not be increasing the cost of living, but we would be obliging people to eat a quality of bread different to that to which they have been accustomed in recent years, and different to that which they desire to eat.  But we would definitely remove a great handicap from the Irish millers, and we would give every miller that amount of natural protection that he would be able to get the wheat delivered as cheaply as the British miller gets it, and the British miller would have to bear the cost of transit from Great Britain to here. 
     I am inclined to think that that probably alone would be sufficient to enable the flour-milling industry to be continued here on a profitable basis. Some of the existing mills would go out   of existence.  I do not think there is anything that can save a great number of mills.  No tariff that we might impose can possibly save them.  They are bound to be replaced by more efficient mills, and that speedily, if we have a tariff.  I believe if we give them the full advantage of this natural protection that we would have some mills put in a position to extend, while less efficient and less favourably situated mills would have to go out of existence. Deputy Lemass asked what matters were the Executive Council considering. We are considering that matter of straight-run flour&mdash;whether we could not do something for the mills and make a proposal to the Dail which would not increase the cost of living on the people. 
     The question of wheat is a very big one.  Countries with a climate like ours do not depend on wheat flour to the extent that we do.  Northern European countries do eat rye bread very largely. I do not think it would be possible at all to get the people of this country to take to the eating of rye bread, and we are up against that difficulty.  The information that I have is that if we were to insist on the use of Irish wheat the cost of bread and the cost of living would be materially increased; that a certain small percentage of the wheat grown on the most suitable land of the country can be produced, perhaps, at a cost that enables the farmers to sell to the millers in competition with world prices, but that any increase on that could only be obtained by offering a higher price to the farmers. 
     The Report refers to the difficulties in connection with Irish wheat and the higher percentage of moisture in the Irish wheat, the allowances that must be made for that in the price of the wheat, the cost of kiln drying, and so on.  The information that we have is that to increase considerably the percentage of Irish wheat used in the manufacture of flour in this country would involve a substantial increase in the cost of bread, and it is a matter for consideration, and it is a very big matter deserving serious consideration, whether if that is so it is worth while increasing the cost of bread substantially. I feel that we can easily carry the doctrines of self-support too   far, self-support in every respect, and it is undoubtedly true that if this country were blockaded, while our economy is as it is at present, we could not continue. The food habits of the people would have to change.  But there would not be a danger of starvation.  There is also this fact.  Some Deputy said that the British would take care to retain all the flour for themselves, but in point of fact the British would be wanting products of ours, and they would want them probably as badly as they would want flour and would give us flour in exchange.  I do not think anything can be assumed in connection with that matter, but it is deserving of the very greatest and most careful consideration that can possibly be given.  Deputy Lemass argued, as far as I could gather, that it was really rather ridiculous to assume that an increase in the price of flour would result in an increase in the price of bread.  It seems to me, in fact, that it is rather ridiculous to argue or suggest the opposite. 
     There may be profiteering on the part of the bakers, but we want to convince them of the evil of their ways and lead them to adopt other courses. If they profiteer when flour is at a certain price, if we raise the price. whether by 1/3 or by 3/- a sack, I think the most likely supposition is that a corresponding amount of profiteering will go on.  It is extremely difficult to stop profiteering.  This is a matter which I, as Minister, have had occasion, because of Cabinet discussions, to consider a great deal, and any attempt to stop profiteering involves the setting up of elaborate and costly official machinery, with the possibility that we will rather stabilise prices at something above the average, so that on the whole you will have an increase as a result of the machinery and interference rather than a decrease, although there might be a decrease in some particular case.  Profiteering is an extremely difficult thing to stop.  I believe, so far as bakers are concerned, owing to the fact that the country is under-milled at present, the inevitable result of the imposition of a tariff on flour would be that they would go very close to taking the full   3/- a sack, which would be the amount of the tariff.  Undoubtedly big profits would be made, but there would be an extension of mills, and after a time the amount would be less than that.  I do not think that we, as I have already said, are in any danger of having a total extinction of flour-milling.  If we were going to have a total extinction of flour-milling, I do not think that we could agree to that, and even if the cost were going to be higher we would have to do something to prevent that occurring.  It is unlikely that we will ever have a lower price here than the British price, whatever it may be, but if there was a combination in England to put the price of flour to 5/-, 6/- or 7/- a sack more than it ought to be, I have little doubt that any mills we might have would follow suit.  At the same time there is just the possibility that they might not follow suit, and in any case we would, if we were being treated in any particular way that was unfair by outside millers, have a substantial flour-milling industry, and would have, at least, some check on them and know how things are going. I do not think we could afford to see the total extinction of the flour-milling industry, but we must not, because a particular firm which is seeking a tariff says that flour-milling is going to be extinguished if something is not done, take that view too seriously.  We must allow for the rhetoric that is bound to be in it, and while it seems to me this matter is important and cannot be disposed of by this discussion, there is no good in taking an alarmist point of view, and saying that the industry is going to be extinguished. 
     Certain mills have closed and certain other mills will have to close.  Nothing will prevent that.  I cannot see that the people who are interested in inefficient and badly situated mills, and who are, perhaps, the most clamorous for a tariff would benefit by anything that may be done, so that we must look around this matter and examine the issues which are indirectly raised.  I feel that it would be advantageous if the whole wheat position could be fully and carefully examined.  I want to say finally in connection with this particular Report that I believe the imposition of   a tariff of 3/- a sack, as asked for by millers, would have no effect whatever on agriculture, and I am prejudiced against them, because I believe they dragged the agricultural problem in in a propagandist spirit.  I would have preferred them to face up quite frankly to the matter, and deal with it more seriously than they did.  I have heard this agricultural argument, and it has never been really put in a way that was at all convincing to me.  I could never feel that the references to it by millers were ever more than purely propagandist references, designed to get the support of people who would not analyse it, and who would think somehow or other that the imposition of a tariff on flour was going to help them. I would like if that question were examined.  If it is seen that we can grow large quantities of wheat economically to compete with world prices, then the whole matter is simple, and although I believe that would involve forcing a change of taste on the people, we would be fully justified in going ahead and forcing that change of taste. If, on the other hand, it is proved that we cannot grow large quantities of wheat at home at prices that are comparable to world prices, we have a very difficult problem to solve, as to whether the cost of increasing the area of wheat is worth while.  In any case we can then consider what Deputy Flinn definitely stated is really a subsidiary problem.  The question of milling is subsidiary.  I we never grew wheat, then we just want milling as a certain reserve and check on people outside.  If we are to grow wheat in large quantities the mills have a vital importance. In order to be able to take a definitely sound decision the matter requires a great deal more exploration and consideration than it has received. 
     
      
       If any Deputy had any doubt that the Tariff Commission would have come to any other conclusion than it did, I do not think the speeches delivered from the opposite side, particularly the speech of Deputy Flinn, would have dispelled that doubt. Deputy Flinn talked about ten or fifteen minutes before he mentioned the word flour.  I am not surprised that Deputy Flinn should have evaded   the issue of the tariff on flour, because some months ago, when discussing the question of the Tariff Commissioners, Deputy Flinn, with an airy wave of his hand, referred to them and said they were at that moment discussing the question of a tariff on flour, much the same as if the subject was unworthy of attention.  I do not think I need deal further with Deputy Flinn's argument. Deputy de Valera said there was no evidence to prove that there would be an increase in the price of flour if the tariff was put on.  Deputy Lemass did not go so far.  He said that possibly an increase of 1/3 might occur.  Deputy O'Reilly said the whole question of an increase in price was a farce, so that if we take Deputy de Valera, Deputy Lemass, or Deputy O'Reilly we have got to wipe out altogether the question of the increase in price.  But the question of an increase in price does, unfortunately, affect the common or garden person who eats the loaf, and, notwithstanding what Deputy de Valera has said, Deputies should consider the advisability of not adopting a tariff. 
     
     I think that the Minister for Finance went to the root of the matter.  If we are to have a tariff on flour it must be for the sole purpose of increasing the growth of wheat in this country.  Would the imposition of a tariff increase the growth of wheat?  One of the witnesses to the Tariff Commission referred to the fact that as a consideration to the farmers to grow more wheat, they might give them an undertaking to pay the average international price.  Is there any evidence whatsoever that the farmers could grow wheat at the average international price?  Even taking the average international price of the best wheat that the world can produce &mdash;which we undoubtedly cannot produce&mdash;could they grow inferior wheat at that price?  There is no one in this country who has any experience of wheat-growing who would for a moment assert that we could grow even inferior wheat at anything approaching the cost of production of the No. 1 or No. 2 wheats of Canada or Northern America, and until you change the tastes of the people, until you come to the point when the people are prepared   to eat the bread that our forefathers ate a hundred years ago, you will have to have wheat that is grown in Canada or in other similar countries, that is, No. 1 or No. 2, that we cannot grow. Until we come to the position that the people are prepared to eat the bread they ate a hundred years ago, or less, it will be impossible to re-establish to any extent the growing of wheat in this country for human consumption, by a tariff or any other means.  You may again come to the point when the people will be content to eat the bread our forefathers ate, but, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, you will have to put us under war conditions and you will have to compel the people to do so, because they will not do so for choice.  With the habit of good food that the people have got, they will not give up the light white loaf they are now eating and go back again to the darker-coloured loaf.  As far as I am concerned, I would prefer to eat it, but unfortunately the common or garden people will not eat it unless they are compelled.  Therefore, as far as the wheat-producing portion of the argument is concerned, I think it is wiped out. 
     We then come to the possibility of the millers closing down.  The millers will not close down.  Even on Deputy de Valera's argument there is no reason why they should close down.  They do not need a tariff to keep going.  If they do not want to put any increase on the price of flour now, in the name of common sense, what do they want with a tariff?  If the larger millers are able to compete at present on even terms with the English millers, what do they need a tariff for?  If they get a tariff they are not going to pass it on to the bakers.  Deputy Lemass said that the bakers are the culprits of the whole piece, that they would nullify whatever benefits we would get from a tariff, and that in fact at present they are charging pence too much for the bread as it is.  I think he excepted the city I represent; he was good enough to say that the Limerick bakers were not charging an excessive price, but he did say that the bakers in the Saorstat generally were charging   excessive prices, and he said that whatever increase in the price of bread might possibly be necessary if the tariff was imposed would be wiped out by making the bakers reduce their excessive profits.  If the bakers are charging excessive prices for bread, and if there is a possibility of reducing that cost with a tariff, in the name of goodness why do we not get that now?  If they are to reduce the price of bread because a tariff is there, surely the machinery to do so could be set up now. But the Minister for Finance does not believe that it is possible to have machinery to settle prices.  It is a question for the general public, and not for this House.  The public could themselves regulate prices by refusing to buy from certain firms that they are quite sure are profiteering. 
     I agree with one thing that Deputy O'Reilly said, that only one-third of the cattle are properly fed.  I am perhaps getting out of order in referring to this, but as far as the cultivation of wheat is concerned the only thing that wheat or any other cereal that is grown in this country is of use for is for the feeding of cattle.  Whatever the experts may say, the growing of wheat for human consumption is an impossibility, taking into consideration the present taste.  I spent about fourteen years in another country, and a considerable portion of that time was spent in growing wheat.  I came back to this country full of the laziness of the farmers of this country in not producing wheat and agreeing with reports as to what a lazy lot the farmers were.  I attempted to grow wheat for two years, and I gave it up. 
     
      
       You got lazy too. 
     
     
      
       Wheat is one of the things that I happen to know something about.  I have seen a good deal of wheat grown, perhaps more at one time than most Deputies, but I have never yet seen a sample of wheat produced here that would be as good as No. 1 or No. 2.  Deputy Flinn comes here with an air of authority and says that somebody told him so, but Deputy Flinn does not tell me that I can grow No. 1 or No. 2, or even No. 3 wheat. 
     
     
      
       I did not say you could   do anything.  I said that the millers could mill a certain proportion of Irish wheat. 
     
     
      
       Why do they not? 
     
     
      
       They could. 
     
     
      
       took the Chair. 
     
     
      
       The millers could mill a large proportion of Irish wheat; they could mill ninety-nine and one-ninth per cent. of Irish wheat and put a little bit of yeast into it, but they could not sell it, and the bakers could not sell it.  The whole question of this tariff on wheat must be deferred until we see the possibility of applying it to agriculture, because it is not on the number of men you would employ in the milling industry that you must judge the ultimate result of this tariff. If it would benefit agriculture, I am with you, but it has not been proved to me that it would benefit agriculture, nor do I think it has been proved to the satisfaction of the House that any tariff that could possibly be put on it, even if it were ten times this tariff, would at present have the effect of increasing the growth of wheat in this country. 
     
     
      
       The Minister for Finance said that if he were quite satisfied that it was not going to raise the cost of living, he would be in favour of a tariff on flour.  One thing that I thought would have been suggested during this debate was not suggested, and I do not know that it was even considered by the Tariff Commission. Suppose we put a tariff of 3/- a sack on flour&mdash;and while everybody admits that the mills would ultimately be able to mill a hundred per cent. of our requirements&mdash;suppose that while the mills were getting going a certain amount of flour were allowed in under permit.  In that way there would be no increase in the cost of flour, and consequently there should be none in the price of flour.  Nobody would suggest, I presume, that if mills which are now working half-time were working full time they would increase the price of flour.  In fact one would expect that the flour would be sold cheaper,   because the overhead charges would be the same, and when they were turning out twice as much flour as they turn out at present, the flour should be cheaper.  But where there would be danger of an increase in the cost of flour is that if a certain amount of flour had to be imported, with 3/- a sack Customs duty added.  If that were allowed in under permit without this 3/-, I do not see why the price should go up, and we would have the advantage of getting the mills back to working full time. 
       The Tariff Commission showed a great anxiety as to the possibility of a halfpenny going on the 4lb. loaf, and I think the Executive Council based their whole case on the possible increase in the cost of living.  The Minister for Finance has told us that it is nearly impossible to do anything in the way of bringing in regulations or laws to deal with profiteering.  I do not know if that is definite.  If the Executive Council has decided definitely that nothing can be done on this Report of the Food Prices Tribunal, then I suppose we will have to dismiss that line of action.  But I think that there was a possibility there of saving for the public more than the halfpenny that the Tariff Commission are afraid would go on in case of a tariff being applied to flour.  The Minister for Finance also said he did not believe there was much in this argument from the agricultural point of view.  I have always believed myself that it will be a great thing for agriculture in this country if offals could become cheaper, but I never saw a better case than the figures supplied by Professor Whelehan.  I had no idea that the Irish farmer was at such a great disadvantage as he is undoubtedly at by the movements of trade in flour and offals as they at present obtain.  I had no idea that in Denmark, for instance, they get far more than their share of offal and Ireland gets far less than its share, and these two countries compete in the British market for the production promoted by the feeding of those offals as you might say afterwards. 
     
     According to the table Professor Whelehan supplied, Denmark takes   eleven hundred cwt. of flour and gets five hundred thousand cwt. of offal. Ireland takes two and a half million cwt. of flour and only gets three hundred thousand cwt. of offal.  She would be entitled, of course, to more than one hundred times what Denmark gets; as a matter of fact she gets less. In addition we find that offals were sold in Denmark at a price of 5/11 per cwt. and in the Free State at 8/8 per cwt. 
     
      
       Do you mean bran and pollard? 
     
     
      
       Yes. 
     
     
      
       Where are they to be had for that price&mdash;these prices are, of course, wholesale prices? 
     
     
      
       As far as I know these prices are ex-mill in England.  I suppose the same thing applies to Denmark; at any rate the difference in price will remain&mdash;that is, that Denmark gets her food supplies from mills in England for 5/11 and Ireland at 8/8 per cwt. 
     
     
      
       No, that cannot be right.  Take pollard; pollard is £9 15s. a ton at Broadstone, free on rail. 
     
     
      
       Deputy Ryan's point is that he is quoting the figures in England. 
     
     
      
       You can make what deductions you wish, but I am quoting the prices to-day.  The cheapest prices I could get were, white bran and pollard, £9 15s. and £10 5s. 
     
     
      
       There are three qualities of pollard.  Is the price the Minister quoted for medium pollard? 
     
     
      
       No, for the best&mdash; £9 15s. 
     
     
      
       As a matter of fact.  I went into a wholesaler to-day, and 8/8 per cwt. was the price quoted.  That is the figure Professor Whelehan gives. I got quoted the same figure ex-mill at Leith, in Scotland. 
     
     
      
       Ex-mill Leith, in Scotland. 
     
     
     
      
       8/8 per cwt. is the price Ireland pays for her offal, and 5/3 is the price paid by Denmark.  I do not know where Professor Whelehan got his figures. 
     
     
      
       They are in page 53, paragraph 5, of the Report of the Tariff Commission. 
     
     
      
       The paragraph of the Report says:&mdash;&ldquo;More significant is the cost of these offals to these two countries, for it appears that while the Saorstat pays to Great Britain an average price of 8/8 per cwt. for offals Denmark secures her offals from Great Britain at an average price of 5/11 per cwt.  Assuming the Saorstat to have purchased white bran only and Denmark red bran only, the discrepancy in prices is not nearly explained.&rdquo; I do not know where Professor Whelehan got his prices, but I presume he went to a great deal of trouble to verify them, and I accept them.  We are at the disadvantage of paying 2/8 per cwt. more for our offals than Denmark pays, and other things being equal, which they are not, we have at least that disadvantage as compared with Denmark in competing in the British market. 
       The Minister for Finance held that this contention of the Millers' Association, from an agricultural point of view, is more or less propaganda.  It depends on what one means by propaganda. I suppose to make as much as you can of a fact might be called propaganda, and they might perhaps have done that.  There is not a single thing, I believe, that the farmers produce in the way of live stock in this country that does not normally consume a considerable portion of these offals in the way of ration.  In fact there are very few farmers in this country at the present time that are not using offals for all feeding. 
     
     By the way, I noticed a delegate came along from the Farmers' Union and tendered evidence against the tariff.  I do not see what the object of that was.  He cannot possibly have been representing any body of farmers that were using feeding stuffs to any extent.  But he may have represented certain farmers who rely only on grass   and whose only interest in this would be the bread that they buy for the homestead, because it is quite obvious if they were buying feeding stuffs to any extent whatever it would be an advantage to farmers to have this tariff applied.  We find that we are only getting something like 20 per cent. of offals to which we would be entitled on the amount of flour coming into the country from England.  If we got the amount of offals we are entitled to on the amount of flour we import we would have sufficient, and we would not have the case of wholesalers and so on getting them in and paying more than they should pay.  If in addition we had the mills going at full time, the wheat being milled in this country and the offals turned out in the country, we would have them cheaper than by importing them from England by the difference in the freight of, roughly, £1 per ton.  If we obtained these offals at £1 per ton reduction it would mean an enormous advantage to any farmer, whether feeding pigs, fattening cattle, producing milk or producing eggs.  No matter what the activity in the farming line we find it would be to his advantage, and very much to his advantage, to have these prices reduced.  I saw that a few days ago a Senator introduced a motion for a subsidy to farmers fattening cattle at a certain period of the year.  If the offals were reduced in price that in itself would be a subsidy, and it would be a further inducement&mdash;a small inducement at any rate&mdash;to farmers to fatten their cattle in the winter and to raise beef at the very time when a good price could be got for it.  It is easy for any Deputy interested in farming, and who knows the amounts of meal ration required to turn out and produce, say, a gallon of milk or a dozen of eggs, to work out what the reduced price would mean.  I worked it out myself and I believe that, according to the Department of Agriculture figures, it take 31⁄2 lbs. of meals for every gallon of milk produced. Suppose we follow the Department's figures, and that the offals came down £1 per ton, we find we would produce one gallon of milk at one-third of a penny cheaper, and that is quite an appreciable item to any man producing   milk.  The same applies to everything in the farmer's line, no matter what he turns out. 
     We find from figures given by the applicants that you can get the amount of wheat into this country for practically the same price as the amount of flour required.  Therefore, for the 250,000 tons, roughly, that would be required at present to replace the import of flour, the amount of offals would be about 75,000 tons.  If that amount of offals came into the country practically as a present&mdash;I do not say that farmers are going to get it as a present, but taking the country as a whole, if it comes in as a present under this tariff, it is a considerable item. Whatever price it is going to be sold to the farmer at, even if it remains the same as at present, you have, at any rate, 75,000 tons of offals which, taken at the present price of £9 10s., roughly, would make a big difference and help to bring down the adverse trade balance. 
     
      
       I put it to Deputy Ryan, in view of his arguments, that the real moral of the story is, that it is a great pity farmers would not grow an acre of wheat extra each.  Then they would have not only wheat, but bran and pollard at the cost of production, if they take it to the the local mill and have it ground and feed it to their stock, and they need not bother about tariffs, subsidies or anything else.  Everyone could eat the flour.  There would be no question of a difference between patent flour and straight-run flour; no question of increasing the cost of living; none of those complications that everyone on both sides of the House admits are actually present in ordinary commerce. The ordinary laws of supply and demand, so far as customers in the cities are concerned, can take their course, and the farmer at the same time can get all the advantages that Deputy Ryan suggests by reason of this big supply of offals if they would grow one acre of wheat extra after their potatoes. They would have all these advantages, not at £1 per ton lower than the present price, which is suggested by the Report of the Tariff Commission, but at £2 or possibly £2 10s. per ton less, without any reactions of any kind,   good, bad or indifferent, on the ordinary commerce of the country.  They will not do it.  This problem is not a tariff problem; it is an educational problem.  I agree with the point of view expressed in the beginning, namely, that the question of a bounty on wheat does not arise.  It could not arise under this application.  This was an application for a tariff on flour, not for a tariff on wheat.  If there was an application for a tariff on wheat, a very much bigger question would arise.  It seems to me that it is very much more important to increase the wheat supplies of the country than to make arrangements so that imported wheat will be ground into flour in Ireland.  But it does not arise under this application. The Minister for Finance made it quite clear that if this tariff were granted it would not bring an acre of wheat more into cultivation.  How could it?  At present the mills are offering 12s. per cwt. for wheat.  Is it suggested that they would offer more than they are offering?  If they offered more, then of course the price would go up, and you would have not only the increased price due to the 3s. tariff, but the increase due to the extra price of wheat. I put it to any farmer Deputy: Would the Irish farmers grow anything like 10 per cent. of the wheat requirements of the country for, say, 16s. per cwt.? I do not think they would.  If they did, how much would that be? 
     
     
      
       I can tell the Minister that I grew it and made it pay at 12/- per cwt. 
     
     
      
       Why do you not grow it then, and you will get 12/- per cwt. any time? 
     
     
      
       I grew it and made it pay at 12/-. 
     
     
      
       If you grow 100 acres of wheat you will get it bought at 12/- per cwt., if you can make a profit at   that.  But I put it to Deputies that you would not get anything like 10 per cent. of the wheat required for grinding into flour here at 16/- per cwt. That is 4/- more on the wheat; how much more is that on the loaf?  There is another thing that must be taken into account.  Supposing you did grow wheat, there are 600,000 acres of wheat required to supply the whole demand of the country in the way of flour. There are 600,000 acres of potatoes, roughly, grown in the country.  Wheat can be grown more suitably after potatoes, so that the problem looks simple. Let everyone grow in rotation next year wheat after potatoes.  Would that carry us one bit further than we are at present?  Practically everybody at present grows oats or barley&mdash;a few people do grow wheat.  You would not make things better, from the point of view of national economy, if you made the change, that instead of oats or barley you grew wheat.  What you want is that people would grow the same area of potatoes and barley and oats, and grow an acre or an acre and a half extra of wheat.  That is what is desired.  A mere substitution of wheat for oats and barley would not leave the national economy any better.  It would leave it worse, because, as a general rule, you get better results on the average land from oats or barley than from wheat.  These questions do not arise on this matter.  The simple question here is: Should we have a tariff on flour with a view to helping the mills?  It should be confined to that question.  Do not complicate it by pretending, as the Millers' Association have pretended, that they are putting forward this application for a tariff on flour in the interests of the farmers. It is not in the interests of the farmers. The other thing would be in the interests of the farmers, perhaps, but it is a different question and should be discussed differently.

     WRITTEN ANSWERS. - MAYO OLD AGE PENSION CLAIM. 
     
      
       asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that John McNichols, of Newcastle, Meelick, Swinford, was awarded an old age pension of 6/- a week by the Swinford Sub-Committee at their last meeting; whether the award was appealed against; and whether he will consider favourably the finding of the Committee, and confirm the award. 
     
     
      
       So far as can be ascertained from the particulars given this case has not come up on appeal and I have, therefore, no information concerning it.  In the circumstances the Deputy might obtain the information he desires by communicating with the Revenue Commissioners. 
     
     
        An appeal has, however, been received from the Pension Officer, Swinford (Ref. No. A.3142), against the allowance of a pension of 9/- a week to John McNichols.  The relative papers have not, however, come to hand, but they will be dealt with later without any avoidable delay.
